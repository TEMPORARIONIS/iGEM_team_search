https://teams.igem.org/4050	Therapeutics	Tropane alkaloids are plant secondary metabolites and include important medicinal compounds. Most applications are related to neurochemistry and range from the treatment of neuromuscular disorders, including Parkinsons disease, to the use as stimulants. There is increasing need for large-scale, climate-independent, and local production of tropane alkaloids as precursors for medicinal drugs. Our goal is to remedy the impact of world crises on the cultivation and exportation of these drugs. To this avail, we aim to develop a biosynthetic route for a tropane alkaloid intermediate, tropine, in Escherichia coli and the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus. To the best of our knowledge this would be the first production of tropine in a prokaryotic organism and could provide an effective and cheap alternative to current tropine production methods.
https://teams.igem.org/1882	Therapeutics	Hereditary Fructose intolerance is a rare genetic disorder, caused by a deficiency in Aldolase-B, leading to liver or kidney failure after fructose uptake. We will genetically modify the probiotic Lactobacillus johnsonii to metabolize fructose and sucrose instead of glucose in order to effectively remove these metabolites. Therefore we will knock out enzymes involved in glucose metabolism and increase the uptake and metabolism of fructose and sucrose. In order to avoid a significant impact on growth rates we will select suitable knock-out targets based on an analysis of in silico models of closely related species. Since cloning is the main work in both our and most other iGEM projects, we want to make cloning faster, easier and cheaper. We will achieve this by creating backbone inserts for a new plasmid series, that will allow the use of negative selection and a novel plasmid purification technique with the iGEM 3A assembly.

https://teams.igem.org/173	Food/Energy	Cheese whey is classified as a special waste for its high biochemical and chemical oxygen demand. Even if whey can be valorized by extracting high value substances, like whey-proteins, at the end of the treatment the residual liquid is still a special waste for its high lactose content (4%). E. coli was engineered to convert efficiently lactose into ethanol, a precious biofuel. Three main enzymes are involved in this transformation: beta-galactosidase, pyruvate-decarboxylase and alcohol-dehydrogenaseII. Beta-galactosidase (lacZ gene) was over-expressed to obtain higher lactose-glucose conversion yield. Coding sequences of pyruvate-decarboxylase (pdc) and alcohol-dehydrogenaseII (adhB), essential in alcoholic fermentation pathway, were designed by DNA chemical synthesis and codon-optimized for E. coli. The final circuit includes the device to metabolize lactose and the ethanol-producing operon, containing pdc and adhB. It has a theoretical yield of 20kilos/tons of whey. Finally, 3OC6HSL, aTc and lactose/IPTG inducible systems were characterized to be used in this circuit.
https://teams.igem.org/174	Environment	Cadmium contamination can be a serious problem in countries where polluting industries are located close to agricultural sites. Our team developed a design to address this problem using the resiliant spore-forming bacterium Bacillus subtilis. We engineered B. subtilis to sense and sequester cadmium from the environment into metallothionein containing spores, rendering it bio-unavailable. Germination of the spores can be disabled, making retrieval of the cadmium unnecessary since they can persist intact for thousands of years. We computationally simulated the life cycles of individual cells and entire cell populations, to estimate the parameter values necessary to maintain sustainable populations of sporulating, germinating and vegetative cells. Our design required us to engineer stochastic differentiation processes at a single cell level. A sporulation rate tuner was developed and we also engineered a tuneable stochastic invertase switch to stochastically control cell differention and fate.
https://teams.igem.org/175	Information Processing	In our project, we aim at creating a cell-to-cell communication system that allows the propagation of a set of instructions coded on a plasmid, and not just binary information as in quorum sensing. To achieve this goal, we have designed a communication system based on three different modules: a conjugation system, a time-delay genetic circuit, and a self- destructive plasmid. Cell-to-cell communication systems are important because, in most synthetic biology applications, the desired tasks are generally accomplished by a population of cells, rather than by a single cell. The proposed communication system could be used for creating a distributed sensors network, or it could help to better understand and possibly reduce antibiotic resistance in bacteria. Furthermore, we have conducted a survey to study the perception on synthetic biology and related ethical issues, among iGEM participants, students and supervisors. We have focused on the top-down and bottom-up approaches as applied to biology.
https://teams.igem.org/176	Foundational Advance	Evolution is powerful enough to create everything, from biomolecules to ecosystems. The ultimate goal of E. coli Automatic Directed Evolution Machine (E.ADEM) project is to manage the power of evolution, by engineering a robust system framework that can automatically create anything we want in synthetic biology, from various types of parts to complex systems. Each demand can be converted into designing a scoring function to give the evolution process a direction. E.ADEM is designed by implementing evolutionary algorithm back into biology. The core of E.ADEM is a self-adaptive controller that can adjust variation rate and selection pressure, based on fitness score, population size and average fitness score calculated by a quorum sensing device. After comprehensive measurement using constitutive promoter family stimulus signals and modeling of the components, a prototype machine is built. Modular design and PoPS device boundary standard will ensure the extensibility and universality of the machine.
https://teams.igem.org/177	Health/Medicine	The main aim of our project is to design a model system based on genetically modified Escherichia coli, capable of entering into eukaryotic cells. We have developed a regulatory system composed of three distinct functional modules.  The whole system is activated by thermal degradation of the repressor protein, which leads to internalisation of E. coli by mammalian cells. When in endosome, pH-dependent two-component regulatory system activity enables the bacterium to escape to cytoplasm. Once the bacterium is in the cytoplasm some proteins are secreted due to expression of specific genes. In our case, secretion of p53 or bax proteins to mitochondria leads to apoptosis without cell cycle arrest thus enabling complementation of traditional chemotherapeutical agents, which affect only proliferating cells.

https://teams.igem.org/179	Health/Medicine	Lifestyle diseases, diseases caused by unhealthy living habits, comprise one of the major problems in modern society, especially as they may lead to fatal heart problems or even cancer. However, preventing or curing these diseases is presently of extreme difficulty. Our team, Todai-Tokyo, has been tackling treatment of lifestyle diseases such as hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, circadian rhythm dysfunction, and bad smoking habits by using synthetic living systems, utilizing their ability to incorporate complex logic functions and dispensability of external control once in operation. To do this, we aim to create the following:  cells that ingest cholesterol to decrease blood cholesterol levels, healthy low calorie breads, a system in which periodic gene expression is controlled, and bacteria that encourage smokers to quit smoking, respectively. By applying similar synthetic biology  methodologies to these, prevention of numerous lifestyle-related diseases may become reality, serving as a first step towards their eradication.
https://teams.igem.org/180	Information Processing	The project exploits quorum sensing in E. coli to engineer interactions between 'species' such that complex spatiotemporal patterns are generated. We have two systems that correspond the game ³Rock, Paper, Scissors² (RPS) and to Conway¹s ³Game of Life² (GoL). In GoL expression/diffusion of lactones is exploited to create local rules that modulate expression of a fluorescent protein. Fluorescence patterns for different combinations of conditions are modelled using a new simulation tool designed to be generically applicable to inter-bacterial communication. In the RPS system three 'species' each produce a different fluorescent protein whose expression is downregulated by a lactone from one of the other 'species' and hence the interaction network is intransitive. Simulations indicate that when this game is played out on culture plates, a range of complex patterns evolve with time. Also, selective patterning of the different 'species' allows for new 'racetrack' or 'playing field' type of interactivity.
https://teams.igem.org/181	Foundational Advance	There has been growing interest in designing fast and reversible switchable controls over all steps of gene expression, from transcription to post-translational modification. Our project involves engineering S. cerevisiae to localize proteins to various points in the cell in response to light exposure. Under red light, a tagged protein of interest localizes to a specific target, while exposure to far-red light causes the protein to rapidly delocalize and diffuse throughout the cell. This is accomplished using the PhyB-PIF3 system, a light-based transcriptional regulation system found in Arabidopsis. This project has two components. 1) Metabolically engineering yeast to endogenously produce PCB, a tetrapyrrole necessary for system activation, and 2) adapting the PhyB-PIF3 system to localize proteins of interest to different targets in the cell. The versatility and applications for this system are vast, ranging from cellular diffusion studies to easily synchronizing cell division for entire populations.
https://teams.igem.org/182	New Application	Damage to inaccessible pipe systems, such as computer cooling circuits, is difficult to rectify. An Escherichia coli synthetic biology circuit for pipe repair was designed. Pipe breach detection and the restoration of pipe integrity were implemented through exploitation of chemotaxis, and cell lysis that releases a two-component protein-based glue (lysyl oxidase and tropoelastin). Control was achieved using an AND gate with quorum sensing and the lac inducer IPTG (released from the breach) as inputs. Deterministic and stochastic models of the genetic circuit, integrated with an agent-based model of E.coli cells, were used to define the effective radii of cell migration and timing of lysis. Constructed AND gate, quorum sensing and lysis timing modules were experimentally tested. The two-component glue concept was successfully validated using in vitro alpha-omega complementation of beta-galatosidase activity. Finally, a proposal for an igem.org-based parameter database was developed to aid the rapid identifation of BioBricks parameter values.
https://teams.igem.org/183	Software Tools	The ultimate goal of synthetic biology is to program complex biological networks that could achieve desired phenotype and produce significant metabolites in purpose of real world application, by fabricating standard components from an engineering-driven perspective. This project explores the application of theoretical approaches to automatically design synthetic complex biological networks with desired functions defined as dynamical behavior and input-output property. We propose a novel design scheme highlighted in the notion of trade-off that synthetic networks could be obtained by a compromise between performance and robustness. Moreover, series of eligible strategies, which consist of various topologies and possible standard components such as BioBricks, provide multiple choices to facilitate the wet experiment procedure. Description of all feasible solutions takes advantage of SBML and SBGN standard to guarantee extensibility and compatibility.
https://teams.igem.org/184	Health/Medicine	Breast cancer is the second most common type of cancer diagnosed in women. RNAi has proven to be an effective mechanism in the silencing of oncogenes. Therefore, we have attempted to build a viable system for the delivery of RNAi into breast cancer cells. First, we inserted a shRNA sequence coding for the Raf-1 protein into an AAV cassette containing two ITR's, allowing it to reproduce itself in mammalian cells. This cassette was inserted into our chosen vector, the filamentous bacteriophage FUSE-55. An antibody sequence was then added to the phage plasmid near the coat protein sequence in order to target HER2. As an additional feature, we have fused Silicatein and Silintaphin to mStrepavidin, which will bind to a protein tag in the coat, forming silicate structures on the coat of the phage, thereby reducing the immunotoxicity of the bacteriophage in vivo.
https://teams.igem.org/185	Information Processing	Inspired by the natural regulator of circadian bioclock exhibited in most eukaryotic organisms, our team has designed an E.coli-based genetic network derived from the toxin-antitoxin system (TA system). The relE protein（toxin）, is an RNase that preferentially cleaves mRNA stop codons, severely inhibiting translation and preventing colony formation. Whereas expression of relB protein（antitoxin） and tmRNA forms a rescue system to reverse inhibitory effects. Based on these mechanisms our network functions as a bacterial bioclock oscillating between the two states of dormancy and activity. Potential applications of our project include lifespan prolongation of prokaryotes and eukaryotes, since the metabolic process of microbes is vastly decelerated during the dormancy state, just like that of bears and hedgehogs in their hibernation.

https://teams.igem.org/187	Foundational Advance	The creation of simplified artificial cells with specialized functions, along design principles that are compatible with the goals of synthetic biology, requires advances in two key areas. In Silico modelling tools are needed to assess the performance of artificial networks prior to assembly. Genome biofabrication must achieve rates well beyond existing methods using a modular design so that the extent to which natural systems can be made artificial can be tested. We have taken our first steps towards these goals by directing our efforts to the rational refactoring of the E. coli genome. Using flux balance analysis we have identified 117 new genes that may be essential for survival. We have developed and validated a rapid, modular biofabrication method (BioBytes) and have produced BioBytes for 150 of our 447 essential gene list. We have also built a Lego Mindstorm-based DIY biofab robot and extended the concept to a BioFab-on-a-chip prototype.
https://teams.igem.org/188	New Application	Our team constructed a controllable synthetic genetic circuit in Escherichia coli which has timer and counter functions. The circuit works as an OR gate to integrate temporal and environmental signals. The output (red fluorescent protein: RFP) of the OR gate is ON when one of the input signals is ON. The timer function is controlled by Lac promoter, and the concentration of lactose determines timer’s working length. After added lactose is consumed by E. coli, the RFP will be translated to remind us that time’s up. The counter function can detect the bacteria population with LuxI/LuxR device; moreover, the counter sensitivity is controlled by the strength of TetR repressible promoter. If external bacteria invade the system, the extra AHL produced by them will induce the RFP translation to warn us the contamination. Our project can be applied to storage warning signs of fresh food, contact lens, and wound dressing.
https://teams.igem.org/189	Health/Medicine	Our aim is to construct a targeted gene therapy vector with high cellular specificity, considerable capacity and the potential for mass production and universal modification. Analogizing the characteristics of bacteriophage lambda and adenovirus, we genomically engineered the fiber protein of adenovirus with the pC of bacteriophage lambda, with the knob region modified by cell-specific peptides generated by phage display (called targeted biobrick). After inducing the vector genome (generated by bottom-up or top-down approach) into BL21 DE3 E.coli strain, we applied a co-transformed therapeutic DNA (namely a cosmid with a capacity of 40-50 kb) for mass production of our targeted gene therapy vectors containing the desired genes to be delivered. With the targeted biobrick immediating the attachment and RGD domain immediating the internalization of the targeted vector, we are able to accomplish the targeted gene therapy.
https://teams.igem.org/190	Environment	Heavy metal pollution of water and sediment endangers human health and the environment. To battle this problem, a purification strategy was developed in which arsenic, zinc or copper are removed from metal-polluted water and sediment. In this approach Escherichia coli bacteria accumulate metal ions from solutions, after which they produce gas vesicles and start floating. This biological device encompasses two integrated systems: one for metal accumulation, the other for metal-induced buoyancy. The uptake and storage system consists of a metal transporter and metallothioneins (metal binding proteins). The buoyancy system is made up of a metal-induced promoter upstream of a gas vesicle gene cluster. This device can be changed to scavenge for any compound by altering the accumulation and the induction modules. The combination of both systems enables the efficient decontamination of polluted water and sediment in a biological manner.
https://teams.igem.org/191	Foundational Advance	Recent discoveries of photoreceptors in many organisms have given us insights into the interest of using light-responsive genetic tools in synthetic biology. The final goal of our project is to induce a change in gene expression, more specifically to turn a gene on or off, in a living organism, in response to a light stimulus. For this we use light-sensitive DNA binding proteins (or light-sensitive proteins that activate DNA binding proteins) to convert a light input into a chosen output, for example fluorescence, through a reporter gene such as RFP. Demonstrating that the light-induced gene switch tool works in vivo would show that easier and faster tools can potentially be made available in several fields of biology, as such tools can induce more localized, more precise (time resolution and reversibility) and drastically faster genetic changes than currently used ones, thus allowing research to evolve even better.
https://teams.igem.org/192	New Application	A key challenge in metabolic engineering is to improve productivity and yield. Potential applications range from the production of valuable compounds such as therapeutic molecules and biofuels to the degradation of toxic wastes. There is increasing recognition that spatial organization can play an important role in optimizing pathway efficiency. Specifically, the spatial co-localization of consecutive enzymes in a pathway can result in efficient translocation of substrates between enzymes, an effect known as enzyme channeling". Here we report the design modeling and construction of a bacterial micro-organelle based system for the targeted co-localization of selected enzymes. Our "Encapsulator" represents a fundamentally new class of parts which in nature consist of metabolic enzymes encased within a multi-protein shell reminiscent of a viral capsid. Micro-compartments based on encapsulin (and similar proteins) represent an experimentally amenable system to investigate the effects of channeling in potential downstream applications."
https://teams.igem.org/193	Environment	Have any life forms existed on Mars? If so, what kind of features could they have possessed? Today, the Martian environment is severe for any life to inhabit because of some constrained conditions. For instances, the surface temperature having a range from -80℃ to 15℃, CO2 occupying 95% of the atmosphere and the absence of organic substances on the surface don't allow aerobic organisms or heterotrophic bacteria to grow. Our project objective is to create a genetically engineered iron-oxidizing bacteria surviving on Mars and to establish a new model organism playing an important role to terraform Mars. We engineered Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans by introducing a synthetic pathway of both Melanin and Anti Freeze Protein with temperature-regulated systems. Anti Freeze Protein contributes to enhance tolerance of cryogenic condition and Melanin to blacken the Martian surface eventually resulting in melt of ice cap and generation of atmosphere and sea.
https://teams.igem.org/194	Manufacturing	The Redoxilator: By in silico design and computer modelling followed by gene synthesis, we have constructed a molecular NAD/NADH ratio sensing system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The sensor works as an inducible transcription factor being active only at certain levels of the NAD/NADH ratios. By the coupling of a yeast optimized fast degradable GFP, the system can be used for in vivo monitoring of NAD/NADH redox poise. A future novel application of the system is heterologous redox coupled protein production in yeast. The USER fusion standard: Another part of our project is the proposal of a new parts-assembly standard for Biobricks based on USER(TradeMark) cloning. With this technique, not based on restriction enzymes, all parts independent of function can be assembled without leaving any ‘scars’ from the restriction enzyme digestions.
https://teams.igem.org/195	Health/Medicine	1. The objective: Binding viruses to designer ViroCatcher cells that cannot support viral replication to diagnose, attenuate, and prevent infection. 2. What we intend to do: (1) Make our designer cell safe, (2) Express specific cell surface receptors and antibodies to catch the virus, (3) Transduce the signal after viruses attached for feedback control, and (4) Remove the viruses along with ViroCatcher itself. 3. Anticipated results: the ViroCatcher is made safe for the bloodstream. When it is injected into the bloodstream, our ViroCatcher passively lies around letting viruses attach to it by using its 4 receptors: CD4 (for HIV), Integrin (for various viruses), Sialic Acid (for Influenza), and Antibodies (for Influenza). After enough viruses attach to it, or after a certain amount of time elapses, it removes itself from the bloodstream by calling macrophages to eat it up.
https://teams.igem.org/196	Manufacturing	Whether you want to stop a leaking ship’s hull, or repair a fractured bone, you will need a top quality, strong adhesive. Our project aims to create a new generation of glue. In contrast to most glues, ours is natural, biodegradable, efficient on wet surfaces and has exceptional resistance (up to 3 times better than super glue). It is composed of a polysaccharide released by a Gram-negative bacterium, Caulobacter crescentus. Our aim is to use BioBrickTM standard biological parts in order to create a new strain of Escherichia coli which will synthesise this adhesive material. Moreover we are going to use a new plasmid stabilisation technique, the StabyTM system developed by Delphi Genetics. This system allows us to avoid the use of antibiotics and has been shown to be more efficient as far as protein secretion is concerned.
https://teams.igem.org/197	Village	The University of California Berkeley iGEM team has developed an automated approach to large-scale parts assembly that is accurate, high-throughput, reduces labor, and decreases cost. As a test bed for our system we have chosen to explore novel applications of cell surface display within Escherichia coli, the gold standard organism for bacterial engineering. Displaying peptides and proteins on a cell's surface is difficult, and many attempts may have to be made to generate a given functional protein. By automatically generating and testing a large set of diverse proteins paired with various display methods, we can search a large design space and develop guidelines for rational design of projects involving surface display.
https://teams.igem.org/198	Village	Three crucial activities in synthetic biology are the creation of standardized parts, the construction and specification of devices from these parts, and the automatic assembly of these devices. Each of these activities requires software tools. Tools give users access to data as well as provide algorithmic support and abstraction to design large scale systems. We have created three software tools for these tasks. The first is a domain specific language called Eugene for the specification of biological constructs and rules for their creation. The second contribution is a visual design environment for device creation called Spectacles. Finally, we have created workflows for the Kepler design environment. This work is integrated within the Clotho design framework. We show that together they offer a powerful solution to the problems of today while also providing a path to the more exotic design activities of the future.
https://teams.igem.org/199	North America	Our team goal was to advance the developing field of bacterial computing. The Satisfiability (SAT) problem was the first mathematical problem proven to be NP-complete. A SAT problem is formed by connecting true-false variables with OR to form clauses and connecting clauses with AND. The goal is to determine if true-false values can be assigned to each variable to make the overall logical expression true. Our designed system uses frameshift suppressor tRNAs as inputs and frameshift suppressor leaders (FSLs) that process the inputs to enable the translation of fluorescent proteins exactly when an appropriate combination of inputs is present. The results illustrate the potential of engineered living cells to evaluate challenging mathematical problems. Our project also explored two aspects of synthetic biology education: a survey and analysis of public opinion and teachers’ knowledge of synthetic biology and the design and construction of physical models of a frameshift suppressor.
https://teams.igem.org/200	WIKI	For iGEM 2009 the Imperial College London team present you with The E.ncapsulator; a versatile manufacture and delivery platform by which therapeutics can be reliably targeted to the intestine. Our E.coli chassis progresses through a series of defined stages culminating in the production of a safe, inanimate pill. This sequential process involves drug production, self-encapsulation in a protective coating and genome deletion. The temporal transition through each of these stages has been individually optimised by both media and temperature. The E.ncapsulator provides an innovative method to deliver any biologically synthesisable compound and bypasses the need for expensive storage, packaging and purification processes. The E.ncapsulator is an attractive candidate for commercial pill development and demonstrates the massive manufacturing potential in Synthetic Biology.
https://teams.igem.org/201	Foundational Advance	The project aims to realize a device with standard biological parts for the post-transcriptional control of gene expression, regardless of the gene sequence to be silenced. We designed the T-REX device, composed of two non-coding DNA sequences: the TRANS-repressor and the CIS-repressing parts. TRANS-repressor acts as a silencer of CIS-repressing RNA target. This target includes a region complementary to the TRANS-repressor sequence antisense, ends with RBS, and is assembled upstream of the coding sequence to be silenced. Upon binding of TRANS-repressor and CIS-repressing RNAs, the access to RBS by ribosomes is hampered, silencing translation. Accordingly, the amount of TRANS-repressor controls the translation rate of the regulated gene. The TRANS-repressor sequence was determined by a computational analysis performed to minimize the interference with the genomic mRNAs and to maximize the base-pairing interaction to the CIS-repressing RNA. The T-REX device is proposed as a universal and fast switch in synthetic gene circuits.
https://teams.igem.org/202	WIKI	Synthetic biology has all the characteristic features of an engineering discipline: applying technical and scientific knowledge to design and implement devices, systems, and processes that safely realize a desired objective. Mathematical modeling has always been an important component of engineering disciplines: models and computer simulations can quickly provide a clear picture of how different components influence the behavior of the whole, reaching objectives quickly. Our presentation focuses on sophisticated mathematical models of synthetic biological systems that connect the targeted biological phenotype to the DNA sequence. The activities for iGEM 2009 included the development and testing of simulation tools that connect multiple levels of organization from molecules and their interactions, to gene regulatory relations, to emerging logical architectures in bacteria. We connected out tools to the Registry and validated the simulations with a significant experimental component, constructing and testing these synthetic biological systems in Escherichia coli.
https://teams.igem.org/203	Foundational Advance	Mammalian synthetic biology has a huge potential, but it is in need of new standards and a systematic construction of comprehensive part libraries. Promoters are the fundamental elements of every synthetic biological system. We have developed and successfully applied two novel, in silico guided methods for the rational construction of synthetic promoters which respond only to predefined transcription factors. Thus, we have been able to create a library of promoters of different strength and inducibility. To characterize the promoters, we have developed standardized protocols for comparable measurements of promoter strength by either transient or stable transfection. These synthetic promoters can be used as “spybricks” which enable the construction of assays for simultaneously monitoring several pathways in a cell. However, the potential of synthetic promoters goes far beyond this application: e.g. in virotherapy, these promoters could be used for selective gene expression in target cells.
https://teams.igem.org/204	WIKI	Bio-art has appeared as a crossover of life science and art in 21st century. Such artworks can give rise to a number of issues and metaphors accompanying the advance of science and technology. Astonishingly, there are still few collaborations between bio-art and synthetic biology. In this context, we engineered Salmonella enterica cells to function as new painting tools in bio-art. Specifically, we try to program cells to automatically form various pattern and gradation of colors by sensing cell identity and density by means of quorum sensing. Moreover, we will extend these tools for actual paintings and artworks to consider the ethical implications such as ’view of life’. This collaborative project can show the social situation or question of life science.
https://teams.igem.org/205	Environment	Microbes such as Escherichia coli and Cuprivadis metallidurans have an endogenous multicomponent mercury (Hg2+) uptake and reduction operon, under the control of a metal responsive transcription factor, MerR. By utilising elements of this pathway, with a novel recovery mechanism, mercury can be accumulated intracellularly and efficiently removed from the environment. The presence of mercury activates MerR, driving the expression of Antigen 43 (Ag43), a self-adhering surface protein. Coupling a mercury sensitive promoter to the expression of Ag43 enables cells to accumulate mercury then aggregate in solution. P. syringae is a ubiquitous airborne bacterium which expresses a unique protein, InaZ. This protein acts as a scaffold for ice nucleation, inducing precipitation. Optimal growth of P. syringae occurs at 22oC. By introducing five heat-shock genes, the tolerance range will be increased to better suit the Australian climate. This modification has the potential to increase the availability of Australia’s most precious resource; water.
https://teams.igem.org/206	Village	To date, efforts to design a whole-cell biosensor capable of detecting levels of one or more biological inputs and responding in an analog mode has been elusive. We have designed a system of synthetic constructs implemented in an E. coli chassis that will allow detection of continuously varying levels of a single metabolic input and report on the concentration with qualitative output depending on threshold levels of the input. Our system design utilizes RNA-level hairpin hybridization and antisense technologies linked to various reporters. Because our approach is modular and does not depend on either endogenous protein processing or exogenous RNA, we envision that such a system could find applications in many different fields, including environmental sensing, detection of diagnostic of therapeutic biomarkers, and systems biology.
https://teams.igem.org/207	New Application	Optical communication is central to interactions between many multicellular organisms. However, it is virtually unknown between unicellular organisms, much less between unicellular organisms of different kingdoms of life. Our team has constructed a system that allows for interspecies, bacteria-to-yeast optical communication. To permit bacteria to send an optical signal, we expressed in E. coli a red firefly luciferase under IPTG induction. In yeast, we used a yeast-two-hybrid-system based on the interaction between the red-light-sensitive Arabidopsis thaliana phytochrome PhyB and its interacting factor PIF3. Interaction between PhyB and PIF3 is induced by the red light from the bacteria, resulting in transcription of the lacZ gene. This is an excellent demonstration of the principles and potential of synthetic biology: this system not only allows for interspecies optical communication, but enables us to optically bridge a physically separated canonical lac operon using light as a trans-acting factor.
https://teams.igem.org/208	Manufacturing	The aim of the Utah State University iGEM project is to develop improved upstream and downstream processing strategies for manufacturing cellular products using the standardized BioBrick system. First, we altered the broad-host range vector pRL1383a to comply with BioBrick standards and enable use of BioBrick constructs in organisms like Pseudomonas putida, Rhodobacter sphaeroides, and Synechocystis PCC6803. This vector will facilitate exploitation of advantageous characteristics of these organisms, such as photosynthetic carbon assimilation.  Following expression, product recovery poses a difficult and expensive challenge. Downstream processing of cellular compounds, like polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), commonly represents more than half of the total production expense.  To counter this problem, secretion-promoting BioBrick devices were constructed through genetic fusion of signal peptides with protein-coding regions.  To demonstrate this, the secretion of PHA granule-associated proteins and their affinity to PHA was investigated. Project success will facilitate expression and recovery of BioBrick-coded products in multiple organisms.
https://teams.igem.org/209	Health/Medicine	Some eukaryotic cells, such as white blood cells, have the amazing ability to sense specific external chemical signals, and move toward those signals. This behavior, known as chemotaxis, is a fundamental biological process crucial to such diverse functions as development, wound healing and immune response. Our project focuses on using a synthetic biology approach to manipulate signaling pathways that mediate chemotaxis. We are attempting to reprogram the movements that the cells undergo by altering the guidance and movement machinery of these cells in a modular way. For example, can we steer them to migrate toward new signals? Can we make cells move faster? Slower? We hope to better understand how chemotaxis works, and eventually build cells that can perform useful tasks. Imagine, for example, therapeutic cell-bots that could home to a directed site in the body and execute complex, user-defined functions (e.g., kill tumors, deliver drugs, guide stem cell migration).
https://teams.igem.org/210	WIKI	We have two projects. The first is “GSDD”, the project to make a time bomb"---a unique system to control the time of cell death.  We create timer mechanism by taking advantage of the end-replication problem and the protecting effect of lacI (bound to each end of DNA) against exonuclease digestion.  As the cell divides due to the end-replication problem the "timer" DNA gets shorter and eventually the repressor expression level falls.  Then the downstream killer gene becomes expressed. The other one “Cells in Cells” is the project to make a cell.  We defined making cells as making liposomes that can divide like mitochondria do.  To approach our goal we set two subgoals.  One is to enable cells to take in liposomes.  The other is to enable the liposomes to import proteins needed for mitochondrial division.  We suppose this could be the first step to create artificial cells."
https://teams.igem.org/211	New Application	We aim to engineer a novel yeast strain that can detect, attract and eliminate pests. This strain would serve as an environmental-friendly substitute for pesticides. The idea is demonstrated by constructing an odorant sensing module, coupled production of chemical attractant and production of pest-killing binary toxin in yeast to kill pests lured to the yeast culture. A chimera G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) responsive to an odorant chemical is coupled to the yeast mating pathway that can be activated upon ligand binding.  It leads to over-expression of an endogenous yeast transaminase that catalyzes a reaction to yield 2-phenylethanol.  Constitutively expressed binary toxin in the yeasts would poison the attracted pests after their consumption, as tested by feeding drosophilae. In addition to being a pesticide substitute, this cheaply-maintained engineered yeast strain also serves as a research reagent to screen for GPCRs that bind to certain ligands.
https://teams.igem.org/212	WIKI	The 2009 Brown iGEM Team aims to treat allergic rhinitis (hay fever) by engineering Staphylococcus epidermidis to secrete a histamine-binding protein, rEV131, in response to elevated histamine concentrations during an allergic attack. rEV131 was cloned from a species of tick, Rhipicephalus appendiculatus. We are putting the rEV131 gene into an endogenous element of human nasal flora, Staphylococcus epidermidis. rEV131 will have a secretion tag specific for S. epidermidis. To synchronize rEV131 production with elevation of histamine concentration, we are computationally designing a novel histamine receptor. This histamine-responsive receptor will induce expression of rEV131. Although S. epidermidis is a non-pathogenic species, when it reaches a certain population threshold it produces potentially hazardous biofilms. To mitigate this concern, we have engineered safety measures that prevent excessive growth by repurposing S. epidmidis’ natural population sensor to cue each cell’s suicide" when a population has reached a dangerous size."

https://teams.igem.org/214	Health/Medicine	Atherosclerosis is associated with the buildup of plaques in the vascular walls. Currently, treatment for atherosclerosis involves preventative measures and surgical removal of plaque, angioplasty, and stent placement. We sought to develop an E. coli chassis delivering anti-atherosclerotic substances to the site of plaque in vasculature. Inflamed endothelial cells express VCAM-1, a receptor normally binds to the leukocyte antigen VLA-4. We attempted to express a VLA-4 fragment in E. coli, in order to selectively attach the cells to plaques. In vitro binding test uses inflamed murine endothelial cells which express VCAM-1. Results are pending. Our bacterial chassis also carries several inducible “effector” systems which, upon binding, release substances that facilitate plaque stabilization and regression. Effector systems include heme oxygenase-1, serum amyloid A and atrial natriuretic peptide. Expression of HO-1 in E. coli has been confirmed using spectroscopy. Testing for SAA secretion and ANP-induced gene expression in endothelial cells is ongoing.
https://teams.igem.org/215	Manufacturing	The use of recombinant protein production using E. coli-based expression systems has revolutionized the fields of biotechnology and medicine. However, the ability to utilize such proteins hinges upon their capacity to be isolated from their expression systems. Our project aims to create an all-in-one protein expression and purification system using BioBrick standards to greatly simplify protein production for synthetic biologists, reducing the time and cost involved in standard protein purification methods. Our method uses a novel combination of two systems: secretion and display. By fusing two tags to the protein it can be secreted into the expression media, and subsequently directed to bind to the outside of the cell. To collect the pure proteins, cells only need to be spun down and then resuspended in an elution buffer, releasing the protein of interest. Our research exhibits the utility of synthetic biology for developing new techniques that improve upon established practices.
https://teams.igem.org/216	Environment	Landmines left over from past conflicts are a major hazard in the world, killing and maiming many people every year. We have sought to engineer a bacterium able to detect TNT and its degradation products, nitrites, in the environment. Our system is based around a previously published computationally designed TNT-sensing protein derived from the periplasmic ribose binding protein, which interacts with an EnvZ-Trg transmembrane hybrid fusion protein and a nitrite-responsive repressor to trigger a pathway of TNT degradation and visualization using combined output from a bacterial luciferase and Yellow Fluorescent Protein. We envisage that the detection system could be applied by spraying the organism on soil where the presence of landmines is suspected, and detecting luminescence using low-light sensing. Once located, the mines could be safely removed. This system could be extended to detect other analytes in the environment.
https://teams.igem.org/217	Health/Medicine	Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one of the most common forms of primary brain cancer, which usually results in fatality. To date, it has been difficult to overcome primary brain cancer resulting from GBM, primarily because the cancer-initiating cells are suspected to be highly resistant to current cancer therapies. Specifically, CD133+ cells have shown resistance to hypoxia, irradiation, and some forms of chemotherapy. CD133+ hunting machines will be created by genetically engineering microglial cells (BV-2) with mammalian expression vectors. The project will also take advantage of inherent qualities of the microglia such as constant environmental sensing and quick motility. The engineered BV-2s will be equipped to locate the specific GBMs and label the targeted cells with a tat-GFP fusion protein. It is the goal of this study to show an alternative approach to cancer treatment, and to emphasize the power of biologically available options to fight the disease.
https://teams.igem.org/218	Foundational Advance	iGEM Calgary contributed a second quorum sensing (QS) system to the Registry. The Vibrio harveyi AI-2 QS signalling system has been engineered in Escherichia coli . Coupled with quorum quenching, our system allows us to target biofilm maintenance. The robustness of AI-2 signalling in E. coli was characterized in the lab and compared to data from mathematical models of the system built using the Matlab Simbiology toolbox and the emerging Membrane Computing framework in Mathematica. We also undertook community outreach projects in order to enhance the synthetic biology community. Specifically, the Second Life platform was used to create an educational tool to train future synthetic biologists in an accessible, user-friendly, virtual environment. Moreover, we examined the implications of our project in light of the recently proposed proactionary and precautionary frameworks with special focus on ethical, environmental, economic, legal and social (E3LS) impact.
https://teams.igem.org/219	Foundational Advance	We were inspired by iGEM projects that utilize colored or fluorescent reporter molecules. Specifically, we thought “wouldn’t it be nice to be able to leave a plate out in the field, collect it a day or two later, and be able to tell at what time the synthesis of the reporter molecules was triggered?” Ideally, protein reporters would leave the cell and diffuse through the agar, leaving a clear history of their expression. To this end, we are 1) creating a library of Sec and Tat leader sequence biobricks for directing expressed proteins to the periplasm, 2) making an E. coli expression strain with a weakened outer cell wall that leaks most of the periplasmic proteins to the environment, and 3) measuring and modeling the diffusion of small molecules and proteins in agar to ascertain the ability to derive the times and conditions under which they originated.
https://teams.igem.org/220	Food/Energy	Biofuels represent a potential solution to current world energy demands. Total crude oil replacement based on a 20% fuel titer and current fuel demands would require 5.6 trillion gallons of fresh water per year. Current fresh water supplies may not support this added demand. Alternatively, a sustainable approach may use a portion of the Earth’s 3.5x1020 gallons of ocean water. However, current fuel-producing organisms are unable to thrive in ocean-level osmolarities. Glycine betaine, a powerful osmoprotectant, shields organisms from salt-induced stress. Wild-type Escherichia coli can acquire glycine betaine from their surroundings or synthesize it from environmental choline. Two enzymes, glycine/sarcosine methyltransferase, and sarcosine/dimethyglycine methyltransferase, catalyze three successive methylations of glycine for de novo synthesis of glycine betaine. Here, we demonstrate an engineered E. coli with an increased growth rate under salt induced stress. We highlight utility by demonstrating the improved growth of fuel producing bacteria in ocean water.
https://teams.igem.org/221	Village	We consider ourselves amateurs/novices within the context of the IGEM competition. Our endeavor as “outsiders” is to bring our training in the arts and design to synthetic biology. Over this summer, we learnt the tools and techniques of synthetic biology and developed a piece of life which reflects our concerns, namely, the cultural, ethical and aesthetic implications of Synthetic Biology. Using a DIY approach and getting our hands “wet” was a critical element in the learning process. Our construct synthesizes Geosmin, an enzyme normally produced by cyanobacteria and actinobacteria. The biosynthesis of geosmin from farnesyl diphosphate is catalyzed by a single enzyme germacradienol/germacrene D synthase.E. coli, does not bear a gene that codes for this enzyme. We have expressed this gene in different strains of E. coli. Geosmin is responsible for producing the earthy smell when rain falls after a dry spell of weather.
https://teams.igem.org/222	New Application	The Valencia Team project consists of developing a “bio-screen” of voltage-activated cells, where every “cellular pixel” produces light. It is known that for instance neurons, cardiomyocites or muscle cells are able to sense and respond to electrical signals. These cells use a common second messenger system, calcium ion, which promotes a defined response when an electrical pulse is supplied to them. Nevertheless, these cultures present several technical disadvantages in order to make a handily use of them. Valencia team uses this property on yeast to produce luminescence as a response to electrical stimulus. This project constitutes the first time in which the electrical response of Saccharomyces and its potential applications are going to be tested. The obtained results will be used to build the first iLCD in history. We will reflect the perception that different groups of people have about Synthetic Biology in the survey http://igemvalencia.questionpro.com.
https://teams.igem.org/223	Health/Medicine	Homeostasis relies on the balance between immune cell types, disruption of which leads to autoimmunity. The Stanford team has applied synthetic biology to a longstanding objective of immunotherapy: restoration and maintenance of homeostasis. Stanford’s Escherichia coli-based probiotic will polarize T cell differentiation along antagonistic fates - immunosuppressive Treg and inflammatory Th17 phenotypes - in response to local conditions. Our device design consists of two parts: one that modulates deleterious Treg-driven immunosuppression and another that engages Th17-mediated inflammation. Through specific sensors and effectors, therapy will oscillate between dampening pathologic inflammation and immunosuppression until a balance in the local T cell population is achieved. Securing such homeostasis between these populations has therapeutic implications for autoimmune disorders like IBD, HIV and cancer. We envision our novel and directed probiotic therapy for IBD as acting at the interface between commensal bacteria and human lymphocytes, integrating cutting-edge immunology with synthetic biology.

https://teams.igem.org/225	Manufacturing	Tokyo-NokoGen has developed the Escherichia coli Auto Protein Synthesizer (ESCAPES), an E. coli machine that greatly simplifies the production of your favorite protein. We created a green light-activated actuator to respond to external light signals, as well as a riboregulator-based signal counter to count the number of flashes. In ESCAPES, the first green light flash induces the E. coli to self-aggregate, while the second flash causes them to auto-lyse, thus greatly simplifying the protein preparation process. The light-activated actuator was constructed by fusing the light responsive domain of the Synechocystis photoreceptor CcaS with the EnvZ histidine kinase domain. Self-aggregation is achieved by the induction of the Antigen43 gene, which we isolated from E. coli, while autolysis took advantage of the available BioBrick parts endolysin and holin. ESCAPES helps you “escape” from tedious protein preparation steps, such as centrifugation and cell disruption.
https://teams.igem.org/226	Food/Energy	We at CCSF have begun constructing a bacterial powered battery. The design has been generated with sustainability in mind, and aims to create an alternative to traditional fossil fuel technologies. The battery owes its capabilities to two strains of bacteria: the heterotroph Rhodoferax ferrireducens, and the photoautotroph Rhodopseudomonas palustris. Each strain will occupy its own concentration cell and after being cultured anaerobically, will either oxidize (in the case of R. palustris) ferris iron or reduce (in the case of R. ferrireducens) ferric iron. The resulting current will be collected and used to demonstrate the functionality of the battery. The reduction and oxidation reaction will be self-substaining. This process is further aided by the genetic modification of R. palustris. As a photosynthetic prokaryote, R. palustris generates glucose readily. We intend to share this glucose with R. ferrireducens by inserting a passive glucose transporter into the cells of R. palustris.
https://teams.igem.org/227	Food/Energy	Photosynthetic light harvesting antennas function to collect light and transfer energy to a reaction center for photochemistry. Phototrophs evolved large antennas to compete for photons in natural environments where light is scarce. Consequently, cells at the surface of photobioreactors over-absorb light, leading to attenuated photobioreactor light penetration and starving cells on the interior of photons. This reduction of photosynthetic productivity has been identified as the primary impediment to improving photobioreactor efficiency. While reduction of antenna size improves photosynthetic productivity, current approaches to this end uniformly truncate antennas and are difficult to manipulate from the perspective of bioengineering. We aim to create a modifiable system to optimize antenna size throughout the bioreactor by utilizing a synthetic regulatory mechanism that correlates expression of the pucB/A LH2 antenna genes with incident light intensity. This new application of synthetic biology serves to transform the science of antenna reduction into the engineering of antenna optimization.
https://teams.igem.org/228	Information Processing	We are engineering our E. coli cells to process the correlation information of two enviornmental signal, similar to the process of conditioning in higher orgamisms. We have constructed and tested a series of AND gates which can sense the two signals: the conditioned and unconditioned stimuli. With the presence of both signals, the AND gate outputs a repressor protein and then changes the state of the bistable switch, which acts as a memory module. In this way, our E. coli cells can convert the information about the concurrence of the two signals into its memory. After the memory module is switched and given the conditioned stimulus" the E. coli cells will pass the information to the reporter module and thus exhibit the "conditioned response.""
https://teams.igem.org/229	Village	In Taiwan there are 9 power stations generating energy by coal, and produce 269.1 million tons of CO2 every year. Power stations are major causes of global warming. Therefore, we would like to create a ” biolight” system that can reduce CO2 production and attenuate degree of global warming. We plan to create a new organism that doesn’t need electricity and cause no pollution. We named it “Midnight Apollo”.  The “Midnight Apollo” will be turned on when surrounding area turns dark and will be turned off automatically when the environment becomes bright. The idea is based on two systems, Cph8 and aeoquorin/GFP. The Cph8 is regulated by visible light that can activate protein translation of an illuminating system. Subsequently, this illuminating system would use aeoquorin/GFP to light up the environment. We hope The Midnight Apollo could be applied in producing energy-saved Bio-streetlamp, emergency Biolighting, or Biosearchlight.
https://teams.igem.org/230	Village	Increasing levels of fertilizer required for mechanized farming can result in elevated nitrate levels in soil and groundwater. Due to contaminated food and water, humans are at risk for Methemoglobinemia caused by enterohepatic metabolism of nitrates into ammonia. This process also oxidizes the iron in hemoglobin, rendering it unable to carry oxygen. Infants in particular are susceptible to Methemoglobinemia, also known as “Blue Baby Syndrome”, when formula is reconstituted using contaminated water. In order to prevent Methemoglobinemia, it is essential to detect high concentrations of nitrates. Fnr-NarG is an aerobic mutation of the nitrogen-sensitive promoter NarG that was provided by Dr. Lindow at UC Berkeley. By combining Red Fluorescent Protein with an aerobic mutant strain of NarG, the creation of Red Fluorescent Nitrate Detector (RFND) is possible. RFND is economically efficient because of its ability to self-replicate.
https://teams.igem.org/231	Environment	As many as 137 million people in 70 countries may be affected by groundwater contaminated with arsenic. Existing treatment options are too expensive for the majority of affected areas. Therefore we are developing a bioremediation tool using Escherichia coli to absorb and bind arsenic and remove it from its surrounding environment. Natural and synthetic peptides are employed to sequester the toxic ions and a pump knockout ensures that arsenic stays in the cell. Measurement of growth capacity of the engineered strain in arsenic containing media and quantitative analysis of arsenic sequestration will be performed. Characterization and integration of an arsenic-responsive promoter will allow the sequestration system to dynamically adjust to current conditions. A simple, well-implemented system for biosequestration of arsenic may become part of a solution to a problem denying access to clean drinking water for many.
https://teams.igem.org/233	WIKI	Building complex genetic circuits in a single cell becomes difficult due to the formidable task of co-transforming large nucleotide sequences in addition to the imposed metabolic burden on the cell. Can a complex system be divided into independent modules that reside in different cells and interact with each other using nucleotide and protein mediated cell-cell signalling to act as a single unit? We seek to address this problem using a three pronged approach. Firstly, we are trying to introduce natural competance genes into the biobrick framework which will act as nucleotide importers. We are also building a protein export system using the TAT dependent export pathway. Finally, we are attempting to construct a multi-state turing machine which is a compound, modular computational system that has independent, interacting states which applies the above principle. We hope that this approach overcomes the obstacles in building more complex and composite circuits.
https://teams.igem.org/234	Health/Medicine	This year’s project focuses on genetically engineering the bacterium Lactobacillus plantarum to produce cellulose, as a food additive. L. plantarum was selected as it is already commonly found in yogurt. The aim of generating this novel probiotic is to reduce human morbidity via the subsequent increase in dietary fibre in the gut. The sequestering of glucose for fibre production by L. plantarum provides the additional benefit of effectively reducing dietary sugars. We have successfully extracted the four genes that code for cellulose synthase from the Acetobacter xylinum. These genes were then placed under the control of a strong constitutive promoter, and transformed into Lactobacillus plantarum. Plasmid and genome based expression of the synthase genes are being evaluated and characterized. In the future, cellulose production assays, evaluation of biofilm formation, and in vivo testing will be performed to determine viability as potential health benefits.

The 32<sup>o</sup>C ribothermometer made by the 2008 TUDelft team will be coupled to fluorescent proteins to visually confirm temperature-dependent translation. The ribolock" made by the 2006 Berkeley team will be tested at various temperatures to determine if it could double for use as a ribothermometer. Finally a proof-of-concept NAND logic gate will be constructed: a ribolock will be used to interpret two concurrent environmental signals into an on/off control for mCherry output."
https://teams.igem.org/236	Software Tools	It is challengeable to create a synthetic genome for fulfilling the needs of energy and food. Without the assistance of computing tools, moreover, it would be much more difficult to make the synthetic genome. We here propose a key tool to help the creation of a genome as the essential step. The goal of Essarker is to help users design a minimal genome synthesized through the fundamental frame comprising the essential genes of replication. Essarker is a standalone software to manage and retrieve required sequences of genomes, and explore the essential gene order and direction and the related orthologous genes. It also identifies and visualizes the positions and orientations of genes. In addition, it shows optimal ordering of essential genes and orthologs by statistical analysis.
https://teams.igem.org/237	Health/Medicine	Our goal is to create an E. coli strain, which inhibits Staphylococcus aureus biofilm formation in wounds by producing RNA III-inhibiting-peptide (RIP). S. aureus is one of the largest causes of hospital infections, each year infecting millions of people around the globe. S. aureus is normally commensal, but can create biofilms on implanted medical devices and in post-operational wounds. Biofilm is increasingly hard to treat, as a result of growing resistance to many types of antibiotics. By manipulating E. coli to express a synthetic RIP peptide tagged with an export signal, we hope to reach this goal. RIP has been shown to hinder the quorum-sensing processes essential for biofilm development in S. aureus, thereby making it harder for the bacteria to cause infections. We propose making a bandage that contains our engineered bacteria behind a semipermeable membrane, allowing only small peptides such as RIP to pass through, into the wound.
https://teams.igem.org/238	Manufacturing	'Essencia coli' is a vanillin producing bacterium equipped with a control system that keeps the concentration of vanillin at a constant level. The showpiece of the project is the feedback mechanism. Vanillin synthesis is initiated by irradiation with blue light. The preferred concentration can be modulated using the intensity of that light. At the same time the bacterium measures the amount of vanillin outside the cell and controls its production to maintain the set point. The designed system is universal in nature and has therefore potential benefits in different areas. The concept can easily be applied to other flavours and odours. In fact, any application that requires a constant concentration of a molecular substance is possible.
https://teams.igem.org/239	Foundational Advance	Our project “Stress Light” will produce a series of synthetic biosensor devises, which can improve on the traditional sensors in bio-processing; by using green fluorescent protein (GFP), yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) and red fluorescent protein (RFP) expression as indicators of different stresses for e.coli bacteria during cultivation. Our product and system is called “the traffic-light stress sensor”. It is constructed to express fluorescent proteins of different colors in response to different stimuli which are inhibiting growth or harming production. We aim to build a sensor that can detect shear stress and low oxygen levels. We believe these two stresses are critical in a bioprocessing environment. We are applying e.coli’s native or modified promoters for DegP, Spy and NarK in order to induce transcription. Ideally the cells responses to stressed conditions should be sufficiently accurate, reliable and rapid for the stresses to be detected and mitigated.
https://teams.igem.org/240	Information Processing	Language is an essential part of our civilization. But making sense out of a series of words can only be achieved by certain rules that underlie the language. This set of rules is called a grammar. A grammar tells us how to order words in a meaningful way. These rules can be implemented as a Finite State Automaton (FSA), which for every new word input moves from the current state to the next until it reaches the end of input. We propose in our project a biological model which is based on this con- cept of language parsing from computational linguistics.
https://teams.igem.org/241	Foundational Advance	The aim of our project is to develop a fully-featured platform for chromosome engineering, allowing the in vivo assembly of a synthetic chromosome from interchangeable parts, followed by selective degradation of the native chromosome. We have designed a proof-of-concept for chromosome-building that will use the site-specific integrase of phage ΦC31 to integrate a BioBrick into a defined locus of the E. coli genome. Six pairs of integrase-targeted att sites have been designed to be non-cross-reactive in order to support repeatable cassette-exchange reactions for chromosome building. We have also written software to model the integrase-mediated rearrangement of DNA molecules containing att sites, to aid the design of more elaborate chromosome-building systems. To selectively degrade the native chromosome we designed a nuclease-based, inducible genome-degradation system.

We propose to contend with such infections at a population level by triggering a defense system delivered by an engineered P4 phage.  P4 is a satellite of P2 phage, so it cannot assembly unless some P2 genes are present. Those indispensable genes will be expressed by an E.Coli strain, hence creating a production line of a P4 which will be able to deliver (transduce) standardized synthetic systems to E. Coli and possibly similar species. The defense system will consist of toxins for DNA and rRNA degradation, transcribed by T3 or T7 RNA-Polymerases, fast enough to stop phage's assembly and scattering. The system includes the spread of an AHL, hence warning" the population to prepare against further T3 or T7 infection. We will implement a stochastic population model to simulate the infection processes and quantify the efficiency of our system."
https://teams.igem.org/243	Village	Gene technology is driven by the use of restriction endonucleases. Yet, constraints of limited sequence length and variation recognized by available restriction enzymes pose a major roadblock for synthetic biology. We developed the basis for universal restriction enzymes, primarily for routine cloning but also with potential for in-vivo applications. We use a nucleotide cleavage domain fused to a binding domain, which recognizes a programmable adapter that mediates DNA binding and thus cleavage. As adapter we use readily available modified oligonucleotides, as binding domain anticalins, and as cleavage domain FokI moieties engineered for heterodimerization and activity. For application, this universal enzyme has merely to be mixed with the sequence-specific oligonucleotide and the target DNA. Binding and release are addressed by thermocycling. We provide concepts for in-vivo applications by external adapter delivery and activity regulation by photo switching. Additionally, an argonaute protein is engineered towards a DNA endonuclease.

Biological systems provide an attractive opportunity to design and easily manufacture material with programmable properties. DNA origami demonstrated the power of this technology by creating a variety of assemblies that can be easily encoded in the nucleotide sequence. However, for biological nanodevices nature favors polypeptides over nucleic acids due to stability and versatility of amino-acid side chains. With few exceptions protein and peptide assemblies have been considered too difficult for the bottom-up design due to complex interactions and manufacturing problems specific for each case. We present technology for manufacturing nanomaterials based on combinations of modular peptide elements and protein domains, which allow self-assembly into complex tertiary structures with designed macroscopic properties. We will demonstrate the feasibility and potentials of protein nanotechnology by design, streamlining the production and technological application of nanomaterials based on nanoBRICKsPRO.
https://teams.igem.org/246	Foundational Advance	By modifying E.coli so that it can use a phytochrome- with a light receptor- from cyanobacteria as a trigger of protein generation. This pathway is controlled by a certain wavelength of red light, acting as a system switch for lacZ production. LacZ can react with substrate X-gal and form a blue precipitate as a reporter. However, other reporter genes can be attached to the lacZ gene, so different reporters can be expressed. From the fact that this mechanism is sensitive to a certain wavelength of light, we hope to create a system that can be sensitive to various wavelengths and hence triggering different protein generation. Through this the E.coli can become a wavelength sensor; a different wavelength can trigger a different production of protein, for example various types of fluorescent protein, giving a different a colour-scaled indication of the wavelength of the environment around the E.coli.

The mechanism is very simple; (1) the "Transmitter cells" generates the signal molecules whose concentration gradually increases (2) when it reaches a certain level the "Receiver cells" switch on the expression of any given genes. Precise control of the time of delay of this entire process one can pre-set the time of expression of genetic functions in a predicable manner. By using Asyl-Homoserine Lactones(AHLs) that can freely pass through the cell membrane as signal molecules the time can be shared in real time by all cells within the pot. This way receiver (timer) cells would take the action all at once in right timing minimizing the distribution in each cell's response time. This year we are trying to make a platform for generating an animated pictures using series of new timer cells we have constructed."

https://teams.igem.org/249	Foundational Advance	The issues surrounding energy production are becoming more prominent with increasing environmental concerns and the rising cost of energy. Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) use biological systems to produce an electrical current. Cyanobacteria are organisms which have been studied in MFCs and have been found to create a current, although not highly efficient (Tsujimura et al., 2001). We wish to increase the efficiency of the cyanobacteria MFC by introducing microcompartments to create a BioBattery. The microcompartments are created by the production of the protein lumazine synthase forms icosahedral capsids. As a proof of principle we will create this system within Escherichia coli and target two different fluorescent proteins within the microcompartment to observe fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Furthermore, we will be exploring a novel method for the mass production of uniform nanoparticles, which is more efficient and cost effective than current methods.

https://teams.igem.org/252	Information Processing	The Illinois iGEM team has been working to engineer a decoder function within E. coli. Decoders are logic devices used frequently in low-level computer architecture. We are creating a 2 to 4 decoder, which takes two binary inputs to activate one of four outputs. Each output corresponds to a specific combination of the inputs. With the presence of lactose and arabinose, our Bacterial Decoder will express Green Fluorescent Protein. If only lactose is present, a different fluorescent protein will be expressed. This goes for the other two combinations as well (only arabinose, or neither sugars). To implement logic we use combinations of small non-coding RNAs and transcription factors. The system allows the next engineer to swap standard parts in and out to change the inputs and outputs. Our Bacterial Decoder can help sense for multiple environmental cues, having implications for medical diagnostics and environmental and water contaminant detection.

The liquid handling system is build by designing and implementing 3 LegoRoboBrick modular components: ALPHA (Automated Lego Pipette Head Assembly), BETA (BioBrick Environmental Testing Apparatus), and PHI (Pneumatic Handling Interface).  We will demonstrate that the same BioBrick assembly software can run on multiple plug-and-play LegoRoboBrick instances with different physical dimensions and geometric configurations. The modular design of LegoRoboBricks allows easy extension of new laboratory functionalities in the future.

Our team will use synthetic biology approaches to answer these questions. Our team comprises of nine undergraduates, 3 graduate students as student mentor and two faculty mentors, one each from biology and engineering background. The project specifically deals with the analysis of effect of single and multiple feedback loops on gene expression. This project will involve theoretical and experimental studies. We have designed synthetic constructs to mimic multiple feedbacks. The focus of our experimental work will be to visualize the effect of multiple feedback loops on the synthetic construct using single cell analysis. The project will provide insights into the roles of multiple feedback loops in biological systems.

Our system, pLaqUe Out!, ideally based in a macrophage chassis, when introduced into the bloodstream, will be activated by a symptom typical of plaque buildup. Upon activation, our system will release a cholesterol degrading enzyme, a novel reporter protein and a vasodilator. The cholesterol degrading enzyme will break down the plaque. The reporter protein was chosen for expression because of its unique fluorescent property. This allows the plaque site to be identified in a manner similar to X-ray visualization. Finally the vasodilator will simultaneously dilate the blood vessels for better flow, as well as switch off the extended activity of our system. In the interests of time, this system is first modeled using E.Coli.
https://teams.igem.org/257	Foundational Advance	Sending a message across the ocean… Outer membrane vesicles (OMV), naturally produced by gram negative bacteria as E. Coli, are strong candidates for long-distance messaging. Our engineered communication platform consists of controlling OMV production by destabilizing membrane integrity through over-expression of specific periplasmic proteins (e.g., TolR). In order to control and modulate message content, we used fusions with OmpA signal sequence and the ClyA hemolysin as delivery tags. A targeting system was developed, based on the outer-membrane expression of Jun/Fos leucine zippers to control the vesicle flux between donor and recipient cells. Once received, the signal from incoming vesicles is transduced through a modified Fec pathway, whereby the receptor is provided by the OMV. Computational models provided insight to all of the above steps. Such reliable communications systems have wide biotechnological implications, ranging from targeted drugs delivery and detoxification to advanced division of labor or even cell-based computing.

By this purpose, designing a wound dressing which is natural, non-toxic, and biodegradable and imitating the actual wound healing mechanism which is forming on open wounds in mammalian tissues is our main purpose.By this wound covering, we will fasten the healing process, and protect the wounded area from infectious agents. In this wound dressing, there will be 4 layers including polyurethane layers and our bacteria colonies. Our bacteria colonies will be capable of synthesizing human epidermal growth factor and keratinocyte growth factor. The communication between these bacteria colonies will be dependent on quorum sensing molecules.
https://teams.igem.org/259	Foundational Advance	Directed delivery of specific proteins into cells would have dramatic consequences for drug delivery and expand the horizons of synthetic biology into the multicellular domain via discrete, targetted communication. Gram-negative bacteria naturally produce outer member vesicles (OMVs): spherical, bilayered proteolipids from 20-200nm in diameter. OMVs carry outer membrane, periplasmic and cytoplasmic proteins, DNA, RNA and other biological molecules. They protect their cargo from the extracellular environment and deliver it to a multitude of target cells via membrane fusion. We investigate the possibility of allowing the secretion of any protein in OMVs via fusion with novel, non-toxic partners enhanced in OMVs, using a novel Bioscaffold compatible with the current assembly standard. A new version of the award winning BSim software has been developed to study applications at the population level such as communication. The ultimate goal is to create a safe and standardised system for directed delivery of proteins into cells.
https://teams.igem.org/260	Manufacturing	Manufacturing functionalized proteins in vitro poses a challenge, as it requires coordinated molecular assemblies and multi-step reactions. In this project we aim to control, over time and space, the production of proteins tagged with a silver-binding peptide for in situ silver nanoparticle nucleation inside microdroplets generated by microfluidic devices. Combining a transcription-translation system with protein coding genes and a recombination logic inside microdroplets provides spatial control. Moreover, in the microfluidic chamber we can pinpoint the beginning of synthesis, and easily track and isolate the droplets. Site-specific recombination generates a molecular timer for temporal control of protein synthesis. Unlike transcriptional regulation, this method gives true all-or-none induction due to covalent modification of DNA by Flp recombinase. Determining the transfer curve of inter-FRT site distance versus average recombination time allows the onset of gene expression to be predicted. We then apply this Flp reporter system as a powerful PoPS measurement device.

Once we have proven that we can produce cinnamaldehyde in E. coli, we will engineer cinnamaldehyde production in duckweed, a small aquatic plant.

However, most publicly available parts (including those in the Registry) remain largely uncharacterized. Therefore, we propose a minimal measurement standard for the quantitative characterization of one of the most frequently used parts, promoters. This approach uses both mRNA and protein measurements to provide a tractable and universal analysis of relevant promoter characteristics. In an effort to elucidate promoter design principles, we have also designed and characterized new promoter and enhancer sequences. Our goal is to contribute to the advancement of fundamental synthetic biology by evaluating the performance of new and existing promoters and enhancers, which may serve as a model for describing other basic parts such as ribosome binding sites and transcriptional terminators.

Not being able to digest gluten properly inside the small intestine leads to an immune system response that leads to a variety of symptoms. We have designed a bacterial secretion system that could be used in a probiotic organism to secrete an enzyme to degrade the allergen gliadin before it reaches the intestine. A putative advantage a probiotic treatment over direct enzyme therapy approaches is the potential for administering fewer doses, thus making it less troublesome, less costly, and more convenient.  Our secretion system consists of an inducible promoter, ribosome binding site, an extracellular anchor (ompA/INPNC), cleavage signal sequence, 6 HIS Tag and a terminator.  We have tested its behavior in E. coli on two proteins of varying sizes (GFP/Luciferase).

We construct a self activating module and correspondingly an inhibitory one. Self-activation dynamics is given by the las operon, while the inhibitory part is provided by the lux operon. Quorum sensing and diffusion of AHL provide the reaction-diffusion mechanism responsible for the formation of Turing patterns. The importance of our work relies on the fact that we show that the action of the morphogenes as originally proposed by Turing is equivalent to the effect of diffusion of chemicals interacting with the synthetic network, which accounts for the reactive part, a possibility implicit in Turing’s original work in the context of morphogenesis of biological patterns.

To combat these toxins, which act as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, we designed a highly efficient whole-cell S. cerevisiae sensor and biocatalyst system for the detection and remediation of the model organophosphate compound paraoxon and its degradation products. For our biosensor device, reporter constructs were incorporated into the genome downstream of paraoxon and paraoxon-hydrolyis sensitive promoters. Our degradation device was designed in three parts, targeting paraoxon through expression of organophosphate hydrolase from Flavobacterium, sp and two of its degradation byproducts p-nitrophenol and diethyl phosphate. Each device was genomically integrated in order to bypass selective the need for selective condition, while the degradation devices were constitutively expressed for maximum efficiency. Combined, this two-part system allows for both the detection and remediation of a broad range of common and deadly neurotoxins.

https://teams.igem.org/270	Environment	Toluene is a toxic substance used in petrol, paint, paint-thinners and adhesives. Through spills and improper disposal, toluene can contaminate soil and ground water environments. Using microorganisms to clean up toluene-contaminated sites can be an effective and economical way of degrading the pollution before it can spread throughout the environment. There is concern, however, that these non-native microorganisms may upset the balance of the ecosystem through unnatural competition or horizontal synthetic gene transfer. We are engineering the Toluene Terminator as a way to neutralize toluene pollution while addressing these concerns. It will have the capabilities of sensing and mineralizing the toluene into carbon dioxide and water, but this terminator will not be back. The Toluene Terminator will have a suicide mechanism which kills the bacteria in the absence of toluene.

The ultimate goal is to build a micromachine sensing and determining of the concentration of heavy metals in a sample solution (e.g. the waste water). In order to design the system, we will employ two fluorescence proteins (GFP and RFP) and aryl acylamidase as signal reporters. Since each heavy metal promoter produces unique fluorescence or color by those reporters, if more than two heavy metals coexist in a solution, the results would be interpreted from the convoluted fluorescence and/or color rather than a single signal detection. The successful construction of the synthetic modules in E. coli can be utilized in the form of a lyophilized powder, which can be stored in a drug capsule to make it portable.
https://teams.igem.org/272	New Application	Any episome introduced into the cell shows segregational asymmetry accompanied with differential growth rates in the absence and presence of episome leading to an overall loss of the episomal unit in the absence of any selective pressure. We have designed a versatile system which maintains any given plasmid DNA in E.coli by using user-defined selection pressures, limited only by the presence of a response element to said pressure, like most antibiotics, certain chemicals and physical conditions. Depending on this selection pressure, a custom plasmid retaining system can be designed and co-transformed with the plasmid of interest to maintain it.  A similar system can be used to “lock” the function of a gene of interest, like a combination lock, which is unlocked only when the cultures are grown in a pre-determined order of selection pressures. In principle, using this locking system, multiple plasmids can be maintained using a single selection pressure.

This is known as an activation-inhibition system.

https://teams.igem.org/299	Foundational Advance	Our project consists of two parts: BactoDHL and RBS Measurement. BactoDHL is a universal platform for protein and DNA delivery to the mammalian cells. It's based on E. coli strain expressing invasion determinants: invasin from Yersinia pestis and listeriolysin (LLO) from Listeria monocytogenes. Invasin causes uptake of the bacterium into the mammalian cell by induction of endocytosis. Bacterial cells are lysed in the endosome and then LLO is released. LLO is a pore-forming toxin which causes endosomal membrane disruption and release of the payload (either protein or DNA) into cytoplasm of the mammalian cell. In order to fine-tune expression of genes used in our project we conducted measurement of various RBS parts included in 2010 spring distribution both from Community and Anderson's collections. We used standard measurement kit composed of promoter BBa_J23100 and GFP+terminator part BBa_I130401. We performed both relative and absolute RBS strength measurement.
https://teams.igem.org/300	Manufacturing	Large-scale production and purification of recombinant proteins by cell cultures represent a key-area in manufacturing field. The production process still has several drawbacks affecting cost/efficiency. In this work, three modular systems were designed to overcome some of these bottlenecks. A library of self-inducible promoters was built and characterized to start the peptide production at a desired culture density, without expensive inducer molecules. Two standard integrative vectors were realized to insert BioBrick parts in user-defined positions of E. coli or S. cerevisiae genome, to ensure genetic stability without using selection markers. Finally, two promising techniques were combined for an 'in-cell' protein purification: PolyHydroxyAlkanoate (PHA) granules were used as a substrate for PHA-binding peptides (Phasins) fused to the target protein, thus replacing affinity resins/columns and tags, while a pH-based self-cleaving peptide (Intein) was used instead of a protease cleavage site. These solutions are modular and provide useful BioBrick parts for other applications.
https://teams.igem.org/301	Manufacturing	Biopharmaceuticals are commonly synthesized using E. coli as production chassis. Typically, the production of biopharmaceuticals is triggered by the addition of an induction agent, often IPTG, during the bioprocess. The UCL iGEM team aims to create 'independent' cells in which the production phase is triggered by an external stimulus, removing the need for IPTG. The stationary phase growth in bioreactors is preceded by a dip in dissolved oxygen tension (DOT) followed by a DOT spike. We have developed a genetic circuit in which a series of promoters will cause the production to be triggered by the hypoxic condition. This auto-induction promises an economically and manufacturing improved production of biopharmaceuticals. There is the potential of applying this 'Pavlovian' circuit principle in near future to yeast, mammalian or other expression systems for the production of complex biomolecules for the treatment of major diseases.
https://teams.igem.org/302	Manufacturing	BacillaFilla, an engineered Bacillus subtilis, aims to repair microcracks in concrete, which can cause catastrophic structural failure. BacillaFilla would be applied to structures by spraying onto their surface. The Bacillus swims deep into the microcracks. Repair is effected by production of CaCO3, filamentous cells and Levansucrose. CaCO3 expands at the same rate as concrete, making it the ideal filler. A filamentous cell mesh provides reinforcement. Levansucrose glues CaCO3 and filamentous cells in place. B. subtilis 168 sporulates, making it ideal for storage and transportation. The cells are naturally tolerant to concrete's high pH. We repaired 168's defective swrA and sfp, regaining motility. At the end of the crack the quorum communication peptide subtilin triggers a co-ordinated population response from a subtilin-inducible promoter. Upregulating SR1 and rocF promotes arginine and urea production, increasing exogenous CaCO3 deposition. Over-producing yneA induces the filamentous cell phenotype, while SacB converts extracellular sucrose to levansucrose glue.
https://teams.igem.org/303	Information Processing	Synthetic biology endeavors to create information processing systems modeled on digital electronics. The use of quorum sensing can help transform an inherently analog molecular signal into a binary response and simultaneously allow the tuning of input response thresholds and signal amplification. This project demonstrates these capabilities through experimentation and modeling. Another candidate for reapplying an electronic engineering technique is the codesign of hardware and software to implement a function. In synthetic biology, codesign might mean implementing a design spec in different expression control regimes and comparing their relative merits. Our work examines the codesign concept by constructing an AND gate in three different design domains. We explore the application of these ideas with an environmental sensor. A unique aspect of our project is the collaborative nature involving five institutions at three locations.
https://teams.igem.org/304	North America	In order to mitigate the biosecurity risks associated with the potential dual use of gene synthesis, the U.S. Government published a draft version of a 'Screening Framework Guidance for Synthetic Double-Stranded DNA Providers.' This document outlines a minimal DNA sequence screening protocol that gene synthesis companies are encouraged to use prior to fulfilling an order. The protocol relies on the 'Best Match' method developed in response to the limitations of other screening protocols previously proposed by trade organizations. The objective of the 'Best Match' method is to identify sequences which are uniquely related to Select Agents or Toxins. The GenoTHREAT software is being developed in accordance with the Government guidance and, to our knowledge, is the first implementation of the sequence screening procedure outlined in the guidance. Although software characterization has elucidated both strengths and limitations, GenoTHREAT appears to be a viable tool for sequence screening.
https://teams.igem.org/305	New Application	Surface hydrophobicity is a useful property and has many applications. Hydrophobicity keeps a surface clean and dry preventing micro-organisms from attaching to a surface. Most chemical coatings used presently are costly or harmful to the environment. Our idea is to engineer Bacillus subtilis which when applied to a surface, automatically forms a hydrophobic biofilm coating. Succesful biofilm formation will serve as a trigger for the expression of hydrophobic proteins called Chaplins. The result of this process will be a rigid biofilm with embedded hydrophobic proteins, leaving a coated surface which is extremely hydrophobic. Producing a self-assembling hydrophobic biofilm is cheap, there is no high-tech treatment involved and there are no hazardous chemicals necessary to attain a hydrophobic coating. Applications of this hydrophobic biofilm range from anti-fouling coatings on ships to anti-corrosion coatings used to protect sensory equipment.
https://teams.igem.org/306	Village	The growing need for alternative fuel sources has sparked interest and research across many scientific and engineering disciplines. The fledgling field of microbial fuel cell development has previously relied on anaerobic metal reducing organisms such as Geobacter sulfurreduccens. This project sought to isolate genes from the electron shuttling pathway in Geobacter and transform them into the more manageable aerobic Escherichia coli. The Missouri University of Science and Technology iGEM team isolated four outer membrane cytochrome (omc) genes from Geobacter, vital to the extracellular transportation of electrons. The four genes; omcB, omcE, omcS and omcT, were cloned into individual plasmids. The eventual goal is to combine all four genes into one plasmid to transform into E. coli to create an aerobic, electron transporting microbial system.
https://teams.igem.org/307	WIKI	Most of all bacteria have single circular chromosome. But some bacteria have two or more circular chromosomes. In Vibrio cholerae, there are two circular chromosomes, chromosome I and chromosome II, and each perfectly works as a chromosome. We've been motivated by V.cholerae's two chromosome system. So we employed some essential genes, parA, parB, parS, dif, and origin of chromosome II and contstructed a tiny miniature of V.cholerae's two chromosome system in E.coli, using BioBrick assembly method. Also, we built software and database of essential genes for designing of minimal synthetic chromosome and genome. Essential gene informations were gathered from some databases, DEG, EGGS, NCBI and java language was used. Our final goal is making useful, safe and stable synthetic minimal genome for Synthetic Minimal Cell. Although our project is feeble, we extremely believe that our project in this year will be worth first step for that.
https://teams.igem.org/308	Village	Our team's project was to create a biological iron detector using techniques and procedures available to an ordinary high school laboratory that replicate methods used in university research laboratories. We constructed our reporter by combining an iron-sensitive promoter with a red fluorescent protein (RFP) coding sequence. We chose RFP because of its high visibility and easy detection. Although the assembly was successful, the resulting detector is leaky with measurable RFP even in conditions with no iron present. In our lab environment, we found that it was necessary to work with relatively high concentrations of bacteria and DNA. We developed simplified procedures for transformations, digests, and ligations, but we continue to face problems with DNA visualization and measuring the pigments from the bacteria.
https://teams.igem.org/309	Foundational Advance	Historically, the iGEM competition has tended away from working with eukaryotic and multicellular organisms, limiting prospects for higher levels of project complexity in favor of simpler and easier-to-understand bacteria. The nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans was examined as a prospective chassis for use in the competition. Once it was decided that the opportunities presented by the organism appeared to outweigh the challenges involved in working with it, a foundational library of parts was built and tested within the organism. This collection includes useful promoters, reporters, effectors, and a terminator. An educational resource specifically targeted at iGEM participants was written and incorporated into the team wiki in order to assist future teams in learning about and exploring the possibilities offered by C. elegans.
https://teams.igem.org/310	Information Processing	Previously, the majority of engineered, genetic regulation within bacteria has been achieved through the use of transcriptional regulators. However, the recent explosion of interest from the emerging field of RNA regulation provides new insights into the dynamic nature of genetic regulation. Small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) comprise the chief regulatory mechanism for eliciting primary responses to environmental stresses. Acting in conjunction with proteins such as hfq (RNA chaperone), sRNAs provide a cost-effective, specific and rapid response that is essential in targeting gene transcripts for regulation. The Illinois iGEM team has worked to create a set of endogenous and artificial sRNA regulator Biobricks to be used in cellular stress responses and which contribute to bistability in artificial gene circuits. A bacterial metal detection system of arsenic and gold demonstrates the capacity of sRNA regulation in artificial gene circuits.
https://teams.igem.org/311	New Application	Modern microbial engineering methods allow the introduction of useful exogenous metabolic pathways into cells. Metabolism of certain organic compounds is sometimes limited by the production of toxic intermediates. Several bacteria have evolved protein based microcompartments capable of sequestering such reactions, thus protecting cytosolic machinery and processes from interference by these intermediates. For our project, we will identify and transform the genes encoding proteins responsible for the production and assembly of bacterial microcompartment. Additionally, we will confirm the signal sequences that target enzymes to the protein compartments by fusing this sequence to reporter genes. To demonstrate the microcompartment's potential to serve as nanobioreactors, we will target genes encoding a short catabolic pathway into recombinant microcompartments assembled in E. coli.
https://teams.igem.org/313	Information Processing	Information-processing by means of cellular machinery has flourished recently, as exemplified by the creation of bacteria capable of counting or performing AND/OR boolean logic. However, the successful assembly of organisms that integrate multiple (>3) pieces of information into an elongated AND gate has yet to be seen. Our '4C3 leak-switch' realizes such a tool with the use of homologous recombination and leaky transcriptional terminators. This switch turns on only when three of four types of information are transmitted, regardless of the order of transmission, and outputs differently depending on the combinations of input. Our current project aims at creating bacteria that collectively solve the popular puzzle game Sudoku. This aim is achieved by combining this switch with our second subproject, the 'signal-virus,' which relays information only to the relevant targets, based on an antisense-RNA key system. This system realizes parallel-computing and we believe will greatly advance the field of information-processing.
https://teams.igem.org/314	Health & Medicine	While vital to our quality of life, traditional antibiotics face the serious problems of widespread bacterial resistance and destruction of natural gut flora - problems which call for improved twenty-first century antibiotics. Using synthetic biology tools, we designed, built, and tested two new systems to fight infections by both broad types of bacteria - Gram-positive and Gram-negative. Our first project targets Bacillus anthracis, the Gram-positive pathogen that causes anthrax. We re-engineered an enzyme to remove the pathogen's protective coating, rendering it defenseless against the immune system. In our second project, we re-engineered and transplanted a protein secretion system capable of combating Gram-negative bacteria into E. coli. This system was designed to target Gram-negative pathogens in a modular and controllable fashion. These two systems are the vanguard of a new era of antibiotics using the power of nature harnessed with the tools of synthetic biology.
https://teams.igem.org/315	Foundational Advance	We focused on the Knapsack Problem which asks, 'Given a set of weighted items and a knapsack of fixed capacity, is there some subset of these items that fills the knapsack?' Weighted items are represented by TetA alleles that confer measurably distinct levels of tetracycline resistance in E. coli. Excess TetA kills the cells; insufficient TetA can be screened by plating on tetracycline plates. Each TetA allele is coupled with a distinctive fluorescent gene, and both are flanked by variant lox sites. Cre protein can invert or excise floxed DNA, yielding different combinations of expressed TetA alleles. We constructed different TetA alleles by altering codon optimization and characterized the consequence of changing the order of two genes (TetA and RFP). Furthermore, we designed and tested a total of 11 new lox sites for site specific recombination. We developed several open access software tools for the wider synthetic biology community.
https://teams.igem.org/316	Health & Medicine	More than two billion people around the world live with unrelenting illness due to parasites" - WHO Director General Lee Jong-wook. Synthetic biology offers great opportunity for biosensors however current designs require hours before useful output. To tackle this issue in the field it's crucial that our project can respond in minutes hence we have engineered a fast modular sensor framework. This allows detection of a range of different parasites and may also be used as an environmental tool for mapping their spread. We have developed two new technologies that enable our modular input/output - a novel cell surface biosensor customisable for specific parasitic proteases linked through quorum-sensing to a new 'fast-response' module capable of producing a detectable output in minutes. To demonstrate the concept we've designed and fabricated B. subtilis to give a striking colour readout upon detecting the waterborne Schistosoma parasite which affects 200 million people worldwide."
https://teams.igem.org/317	New Application	We propose an entirely new Escherichia coli micro machine that behaves like a tanker, the EcoTanker. The EcoTanker takes up a target compound from the environment and delivers it to a desired location for easy harvesting. The target compound is taken up and stored inside the cell in an EcoTank, a bacterial microcompartment (pduABJKNU). Blue light then directs the delivery of the 'cargo' to a desired destination by phototaxis, using the N. pharaonis blue light responsive domain (NpSRII-NpHtrII-Tar) linked to an E. coli two component system. The EcoTankers are then signaled by green light to self-aggregate and autolyse in response to quorum sensing. We can then easily collect the EcoTanks filled with the target compound, which could be an environmentally toxic substance or an industrially desirable chemical. We expect that EcoTanker to be a powerful machine in various bioremediation and industrial applications.
https://teams.igem.org/318	Health & Medicine	We have designed a universal platform for polypeptide release within the small intestine of the human gut. Our model system release beta-galactosidase, a functional homologue of human lactase, once it reaches the duodenum to help a lactose intolerant patient metabolize lactose. The chassis for this system is the common probiotic in yoghurt, Lactobacillus acidophilus. Once the Lactobacillus acidophilus has reached the duodenum, they will lyse by either by a timed inducible/repressible system, a bile-inducible system, or an encryption system. Using DNA we can mimic the functionality of a combination lock, and produce a 'locked' gene, which can be effectively 'unlocked' only after a specific sequence of inputs. Since DNA functions as a logical medium, the 'locked' and 'unlocked' states are heritable, which makes this system useful as the computational basis for many higher-order genetic devices from bacterial calculators to engineering of new metabolic pathways to bacterial drug delivery systems.
https://teams.igem.org/319	Foundational Advance	The generation rate of complex genetic networks has slowed in the past decade due to a lack of characterized components. We aim to solve this issue by contributing a library of well-characterized yeast toggle switch components with varying dynamics. In order to characterize these switches, each of the two repressors, driven by mutually repressible promoters, is tagged with a distinct fluorescent protein that can be detected and quantified using flow cytometry. To expand the BioBrick database we will submit functionally-tested yeast-enhanced fluorescent proteins, repressors, and a library of repressible promoters. Furthermore, to demonstrate the applicability of these components in fine tuning genetic networks, we hope to use these toggle switches to build a DNA damage sensor with varying levels of sensitivity. We also describe novel methods for BioBrick construction based on natural homologous recombination mechanisms in S. cerevisiae.
https://teams.igem.org/320	Health & Medicine	Malaria is a tropical disease that kills more than 1 million people each year and no effective cure or vaccine exists yet. The EPFL iGEM project aims to stop malaria propagation by acting on the vector: the mosquito. We are engineering Asaia, a bacterium that naturally lives in the mosquito's gut, to express an immunotoxin that can prevent the malaria agent Plasmodium falciparum from infecting the mosquito, thereby eliminating the transmission of this parasite to humans. Asaia is an organism that is easy to grow and genetically manipulate. We are establishing Asaia as a new chassis so that future iGEM teams can quickly and efficiently engineer new and more potent Asaia strains. This will provide the synthetic biology community with a useful tool in the fight against malaria and other mosquito-borne diseases.
https://teams.igem.org/321	Health & Medicine	Cytotoxic cells of the immune system (Natural killers and cytotoxic T cells) identify cancer and virally-infected cells and kill them. These potent killers travel throughout the body, recognizing proteins and other molecules on the surface of target cells. If the target cell is deemed potentially dangerous, the cytotoxic cell grips the target cell tightly and creates an immunological synapse at the site of adhesion. Within this immunological synapse, the killer cell releases cytotoxic granules to kill the target cell without harming any nearby cells allowing for a direct, apoptotic death. Our team will focus on improving the specificity and killing efficiency of cytotoxic cells towards certain cancer types. By using synthetic biology tools and logic gates' design, we hope to create powerful killing biomachines for the fight against cancer. Our newly engineered synthetic devices would have the potential to enhance current adoptive cell-based immunotherapy for cancer patients.
https://teams.igem.org/322	Foundational Advance	The engineering equivalent of Genetic Engineering is to get a bunch of concrete and steel, throw it into a river, and if you can walk across it, call it a bridge. Synthetic biology and iGEM have long?attempted to refine this process of 'bridge-building'. The 2010 University of Edinburgh team has applied this idea comprehensively throughout their project. The BRIDGE protocol (BioBrick Recombineering In Direct Genome Editing) is a protocol for markerless insertion of BioBricks onto the bacterial chromosome, which will bridge ideas and reality in synthetic biology. Bacterial BRIDGEs aim to foster non-chemical means of communication between bacteria by pairing light-producing and light-sensing BioBricks; future teams may make use of them in a variety of novel applications. Finally, human BRIDGEs examine synthetic biology as ways of thinking and the permeation of human aspects, bridging the so-called 'divides' between disciplines and individuals. The question is... how do you think?
https://teams.igem.org/323	New Application	Slovenian iGEM team is designing a cell based system in which we will be able to control the sequence of steps in a multi-step biosynthetic pathway. Our novel approach is designed in such a way that it will enable control of the order and sequence of reactions in a particular biosynthetic pathway. Our goal is to use synthetic biology approach to significantly increase the speed , efficiency or direction of a particular biosynthetic reaction. We will also attempt to use our approach to create a novel chemical product of the existing biosynthetic reactions. This novel cell based device represents a universally applicable principle and offers a significant improvement of current industrially important biotechnological processes. Similar approach will be applied to demonstrate the advantages for cell based oscillators and information within the cell.
https://teams.igem.org/324	Manufacturing	Biological manufacturing of complex compounds often requires the synthesis of many intermediate products. Production of these intermediates is currently triggered by inefficient methods, such as chemical inputs (tetracycline, estrogen-analogs, arabinose, etc) or drastic changes to the cellular environment (pH, oxygen levels, temperature, etc). On an industrial scale, this chemical induction requires large quantities of reagents and extensive purification, while environmental induction requires conditions that can adversely affect cell vitality and yield. To this end, we have designed an E. coli genetic circuit that can pass through four stable states of protein production triggered solely by ON/OFF patterns of light. To efficiently test the components of our circuit, we have also created a system for the transient delivery of transcription factors through the cell and nuclear membranes. With this production method, we can link multiple synthesis steps to a single, clean and rapidly scalable input.
https://teams.igem.org/325	New Application	Bioluminescence is one of the most striking spectacles in the natural world. Taking genes from fireflies and Vibrio fischeri, the Cambridge team have constructed BioBricks which allow light output at a wide range of wavelengths. Firefly luciferase is already used as a reporter, but requires continual addition of the expensive substrate luciferin. We have created codon-optimised operons combining luciferase with a luciferin regenerating enzyme (LRE). This allows recycling of luciferin for sustained light output. In addition, we have submitted the first lux operon to the registry, taking genes from bacteria which form symbiotic relationships with squid. This is the first BioBrick to emit light without addition of substrate and can be used as a reporter with any promoter. These two approaches will allow cheaper assays with brighter signals. We also hope they will lay the foundations for natural light sources that help to address the energy crisis facing our planet.
https://teams.igem.org/326	Asia	As Synthetic Biology is on the rise, iGEM also grows up and part numbers in partsregistry increase with submission of more constructs each year. Our first milestone is to perform more useful standardization on parts-entry due to facing some difficulty while running our algorithms. We also used Software Requirements Specification, Software Design Description and Quality Plan approaches to define requirements for each part and building blocks, risks and design art elements of the designed software program. Next, we have used graph theoretic modeling to visualize relations between parts and to standardize representation of the parts as much as possible. It will help us while trying to find input-output relations between either biobrick parts or constructs. By this way, our program as a Biobrick Guide will provide alternative pathway choices to users for construction of the most reliable devices with respect to given inputs and expected outputs.
https://teams.igem.org/327	Manufacturing	Genetic circuits regulating spatial pattern formation play vital roles in organismal development throughout the eukaryotic domain. We believe that we can use related design principles to synthesize spatial patterning in bacterial populations. Previous genetic devices have allowed bacterial lawns to faithfully reproduce spatial patterns and, with the inclusion of of cell-cell communication, to construct of a bacterial edge detection device. Our device builds on these ideas but differs significantly by aspiring to produce complex spatial patterns in response to simple stimuli rather than by copying the input stimulus. This genetic circuit could drive the creation of biological systems capable of generating spatially varying gene expression profiles in response to simple chemical stimuli. Such devices should have application in fields such as nanofabrication, environmental engineering and tissue engineering.
https://teams.igem.org/328	Food & Energy	We begin by proposing a biosynthetic construction that enables Escherichia coli to produce an antifreeze protein, AFP at less than 15 degrees Celsius. This protein prevents ice crystal formation in the cell, which in turn allows survival at very low temperatures. We develop a switch by adapting the cold-shock E. coli operon with AFP from a fish (Macrozoarces americanus) using a positive feedback circuit. A very important potential application we are interested in is the use of AFP in designing systems helping crops to avoid potential damage from frosts. There are other possible important applications in tissue and organ preservation.
https://teams.igem.org/329	Europe	Counting is the action of finding the number of elements in a set. Past attempts at developing counters in cells have mostly attempted to mimic the binary methods that computers use to count.Our first counter takes a new approach to counting in cells, essentially a mechanical rotary counter implemented on a micro scale. Each time the counter detects an input, it performs an excision and integration directly down-stream of the active site, turning on a reporter and rotating over one 'notch' on the counter.Our second counter operates on the wholly different principle that the statistical occurrence of a rare event in a large population can be modeled. Each cell in our population harbors a construct that when stimulated has a small chance of excising a terminator and expressing a resistance gene. The number of resistant cells is thus an accurate count of the number of input stimuli.
https://teams.igem.org/330	Health & Medicine	Our project aims at establishing an interspecies quorum quenching system in which engineered Lactobacillus can sense and reduce the virulence of potentially pathogenic Staphylococcus aureus. To accomplish this, we are constructing chimeric quorum sensing receptors that can localize on Lactobacillus membrane and detect autoinducing peptides (AIPs) released by S. aureus. The ligand binding to the chimeric receptor will trigger downstream plnABCD pathway and initiate the synthesis and secretion of RNAIII inhibiting peptide (RIP), a heptapeptide with proven effectiveness in attenuating S. aureus virulence. The possibility of achieving this lies in the structural homology of the catalytic domain of the quorum sensing receptors in Lactobacillus and S. aureus. Both receptors belong to the HPK10 subfamily of a two-component histidine kinase family. Attenuation of S. aureus virulence by quorum-sensing inhibitors should not yield a strong selective pressure for development of resistance, and would therefore be an attractive concept for preventive medicine.
https://teams.igem.org/331	Environment	The industrial methods, used to harvest the oil sands, produce contaminated water in the form of tailings ponds with many harmful chemicals such as naphthalic acids, catechol and heavy metals. We are targeting catechol for degradation into common metabolic intermediates of the Krebs Cycle by using xylE from Pseudomonas putida that codes for the protein catechol-2,3-dioxygenase. Catechol-2,3-dioxygenase is being targeted into microcompartments, formed by engineered Aquifex aeolicus protein, lumazine synthase, to reduce cross-talk and increase concentration. The complex will then be purified and applied to the tailings for catechol degradation. By funnelling other pathways through catechol we can develop efficient methods for the decontamination of the tailings ponds. Mms6 from Magnetospirillum magneticum removes heavy metals from solution by forming nanoparticles. The Mms6 protein will be secreted from the cell into the tailings for the removal of metals such as iron and cobalt for creating an efficient bioremediation process.
https://teams.igem.org/332	Environment	The Mosquito Intelligent Terminator (MIT) is designed and optimized to be an ecological and environmental friendly mosquito pesticide. MIT is an engineered E. coli secreting crystal proteins isolated from Bacillus thuringiensis to kill mosquito larvae, or known as wrigglers. These crystal proteins are toxic to certain types of mosquitoes and are not pathogenic to mammals. We designed a temperature-dependent genetic circuit expressing high levels of crystal proteins at room temperature only, thus production does not occur at incubation temperature 37 C. In order to make an environmentally safe insecticide, our design also incorporates a genetic circuit controlling the population size of E. coli. This intelligent terminator is not limited to mosquitos, as it can be custom fitted with different cry genes to other insect species. Currently, with more than one hundred crystal proteins targeting various insect species, our design may potentially serve as a promising pest control solution in the future.

https://teams.igem.org/334	Food & Energy	From water-logged soils to overpopulated regions of tumors, low-oxygen environments distress plant and mammalian systems. Plants with inadequate levels of oxygen move from aerobic respiration to alcohol fermentation to sustain their metabolism. This switch causes the accumulation of byproducts that are detrimental to the plant. A synthetic biological circuit, centering on the alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) promoter, has been developed indicating when low oxygen levels (< 5% O2) are present in plants. Similarly, low oxygen zones can develop in solid tumors in numerous mammalian cancer models. Substantial evidence indicates that hypoxia in tumors initiates angiogenesis, a process that aids in tumor proliferation. Accordingly, an additional hypoxia-sensitive circuit that up-regulates the activity of a reporter protein in low oxygen (<1% O2) environments has been created for mammalian systems. The development and characterization of these circuits will provide tools to explore the consequences and identity of hypoxic environments in mammalian and plant systems.
https://teams.igem.org/335	Software Tools	In order to facilitate the design process for novel bacterial metabolism, our team has created a tool suite known as BioMortar which will automate plasmid design for metabolic processes as well as model cell growth. BioMortar begins with a much improved version of IMPtools, which uses an algorithm over a network generated by the KEGG database, to determine the optimal metabolic pathway according to specified conditions. At this point, it accesses the DNA sequences for each recommended enzyme for each reaction and searches the BioBrick database for related gene sequences. Then, BioMORTAR designs and displays the advised, usable plasmid(s) in BioBrick format for the user. Finally, the program models the growth of the organism, with the addition of the new metabolic pathway(s). By automating the design process, BioMORTAR streamlines the process of designing bacteria with new metabolic processes.

https://teams.igem.org/337	Health & Medicine	The key to successful gene therapy is integration of tissue specificity and fine-tuned target gene expression. The iGEM Team Heidelberg 2010 unlocks the world of synthetic microRNAs, since focusing solely on DNA has often been inconvenient for medical purposes. We engineered a toolkit for standardized measurements of interactions between artificial miRNAs and their binding sites. From this data we were able to compute an in silico model integrating binding site properties and knockdown percentages. Thus, the expression level of any gene of choice could be arbitrarily adjusted by employing the corresponding binding site design. To produce tissue specific miRNA gene shuttles, we developed an evolution-based method for synthesis of new adeno associated viruses. This enabled us to overcome the natural limitations of virus selectivity. In the future, miBricks could be applied for treatment of diseases like Diabetes and Hemophilia, opening the doors to new Synthetic Biology based medical approaches.
https://teams.igem.org/338	Manufacturing	Our goal for the was to create and print a bioplastic, polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), from soybean oil using E. coli. Our proposed design uses a radical crosslinking reagent to crosslink PHB monomers in cell lysate, released upon a light-induced lysis gene network. We hope to apply this printing ability to three-dimensional printing, offering a cheap alternative to current rapid-prototyping technologies. Our work involves characterizing an infrared promoter for light-lysis, experimenting with PHB production in cells, and the design of a dual-wavelength printing system. We discuss how this system could be generalized to create a framework for actuating groups of cells in any 3D volume to theoretically modulate behavior more complex than lysis. We also plan to apply special consideration to the ramifications of possible commercial enterprises developed in iGEM competitions with open source biological materials, such as BioBricks .
https://teams.igem.org/339	Foundational Advance	The majority of projects in synthetic biology involve the over expression of recombinant proteins in microorganisms. A major stumbling block however, is often an inability to express functional protein. This situation is difficult to manage and troubleshoot as it is often unclear why expression is failing. We have designed a system that can accurately and visually report whether a gene is being transcribed and/or translated. The system also differentiates whether expression is failing due to misfolding in the periplasm or cytoplasm. In the case of misfolding, our system can also fine tune expression levels of a given protein to optimize production, increasing the likelihood of obtaining functional protein. To further understand protein misfolding we have built an equation-based, multivariant model of inclusion body formation. Finally, we used a series of podcasts to explore the social implications of our project in the context of the growing synthetic biology industry.
https://teams.igem.org/340	Information Processing	AHL mediated quorum sensing is utilized by many gram negative bacteria for both intra and interspecies communication. Cells containing synthetic DNA constructs that produce fluorescent proteins in the presence of AHLs could be used as in situ reporters of the AHL milleu in dynamic natural systems like biofilms and plant root nodulation. Additionally, cells that can produce AHLs could be used to alter the signalling in these systems and examine the results. Finally, different combinations and spacial arrangements of AHL inducible reporters, AHL producing cells and AHL degrading cells all regulated by the AHL milleu of the media could allow for information processing through the interactions between such nodes. Out team designed a number of AHL regulated nodes, devices that each respond to AHL levels in different ways, and attempted to build some of these nodes to characterize their behavior.
https://teams.igem.org/341	New Application	Tsinghua iGEM 2010 team focus on simulating antibody generation and selection technology with Bacteria, thus develops a new Antibody Production Method. Traditional antibody production method is expensive and time consuming. Thanks to the simple and easy-to-industrialize nature of prokaryotic systems, our antibody production system, once established, will facilitate the cheap and efficient production of antibodies. Production of antibodies in the mammalian immune system involves two steps: Random production of a large numbers of antibodies; Selection of a specific antibody matching the antigen. Therefore, our Antibody Production System would be composed of two devices: Module I: Generation of antibody library; Module II: Selection of specific antibodies.
https://teams.igem.org/342	Manufacturing	Polyhydroxyalcanoates granules (PHAs) are universal prokaryotic storage compounds of carbon and energy. We aim to control their production in E. coli thanks to a new part: a strong promoter sensitive to the shaking speed and the temperature of the water bath. By controlling this production, our team focuses on two final purposes : (1) the granule as a storage system for overproduced lipids with medical applications, such as DHA or EPA and (2) the granule as self-cleaving micro-beads in order to purify a recombinant protein of interest. In bacteria, three separate monofunctional enzymes are required for PHA synthesis. In order to improve this pathway, we intend to model a single multifunctional enzyme based on the study of natural evolution of fatty acid synthesis in animals.
https://teams.igem.org/343	New Application	When generating flow through a microcapillary tube, engineers are met with problems in generating force and keeping fluids mixed or separated. Inspired by an article by Kim et al on bacterial carpets that could generate flow, we have designed a biological system in E. coli that can induce flow and increase mixing in a fluid, essentially working as a microscopic flow actuator. The actuator uses E. coli's flagellas and can be switched on and off using light. Our system is composed of several novel parts: a photosensor, that controls the tumbling frequency of E. coli's flagella via chemical pathways; a hyperflagellation part, to increase the number of flagella and the power of the system; a retinal producing part, that works with the 2009 Cambridge's iGEM team's _-Carotene brick, which we have helped further characterize. Our human practices focused on watermarking synthetic genetic material and improve security in synthetic biology.

https://teams.igem.org/345	Health & Medicine	The RMIT 2010 iGEM team has attempted to create a biological system that will produce peptides at a low economic cost. This biological machine includes the use of a T7 promoter regulated by the Lac elements to express a soluble thermostable protein carrier molecule with an attached peptide of interest. Taq polymerase will be attached to this peptide via a thermolabile bond allowing the peptide to be cleaved using just temperature. The polymerase has furthermore been mutated in such a way to avoid interactions with nucleic acids, thus diminishing the effects it may have in the bacterial host cell. This system can be adopted and enhanced to produce libraries or large scales of peptides/drugs without the high price tag attached to then be distributed to large communities that otherwise cannot afford the cost of research nor treatment.
https://teams.igem.org/346	Environment	During this summer, our group has developed a method to engineer bacteria into heavy metal decontamination kits. First of all, we analyzed the function, structure and operation of the transcription factor MerR, a mercury-responsive regulator in detail via bioware experiments and modeling. Then appropriate topology candidates for proper bioreporters were carefully searched. We selected a candidate and re-designed genetic components to accomplish certain bioreporter function in need, which was verified by following bioware experiments. For bioabsorbents, we engineered MerR into a metal binding peptide. This was followed by inductive expression of engineered peptide on surface, periplasm and cytosol of E.coli. This reverse engineering method was then expanded to lead-responsive regulator, PbrR, to confirm the validness of this method. Results demonstrated that the procedure mentioned above is streamlined enough to construct valid whole-cell bioreporters and bioabsorbents of various heavy metals for field application in the near future.

https://teams.igem.org/348	Food & Energy	Current hydrogen production processes are not sufficiently energy-efficient to provide a viable source of green energy. Our project is to design a genetically engineered Escherichia coli which could be used for hydrogen production. To offset the low yields of hydrogen production through dark fermentation, the substrate would be the organic compounds found in wastewater. The mixed acid fermentation pathway, leading to hydrogen production, can be improved by both the overexpression and the deletion of several genes involved. In addition, we would like to implement various features to enable the strain to perform other tasks related to wastewater treatment, such as biosensor, eliminating nitrogen compounds, or hindering hydrogen consumption by methanogenic bacteria, as well as a planned death system in order to prevent its proliferation in the environnement. We also plan to adapt to iGEM standards the homologous recombination tool used for the deletions.
https://teams.igem.org/349	Foundational Advance	Building DNA is too hard. Democratizing Synthetic Biology will demand fundamental advances to make DNA construction easier and cheaper, thereby enabling broader access to biotechnology by the public. Our team has tackled this challenge with the design of an inexpensive self-contained kit called GENOMIKON, currently targeted for the high school and DIY communities but with clear potential for professional use. The kit contains prefabricated parts that are sequentially assembled on a solid support using cycle times of 5 min./part with a coupling efficiency of ~95%. The parts exist with sufficient diversity and quantity for hundreds of unique experiments. The kit is accompanied by an online resource that serves as lab manual, notebook, information management system and social network for the exchange of ideas. While similar in concept to our last year's project, GENOMIKON differs in most technical aspects and is far superior in performance.
https://teams.igem.org/351	Health & Medicine	Large portion of the world is still suffering from diseases despite of the availability of treatment -tuberculosis in Africa for instance. Such trouble originates from unavailability of cheap and effective diagnostic method. Team KAIST will present DiscoverY that is capable of diagnosing multiple diseases. S.Pombe chassis holds FGFR1-STAT1 pathway with modification in FGFR1, which becomes fusion antibody receptor in our system. When fusion antibody receptors on the surface come in contact with antigens, the pathway is initiated. The pathway ends with GFP expression as diagnostic display. The system will be tested with tuberculosis antibody, and simple replacement of antibody will make DiscoverY the universal diagnostic yeast.
https://teams.igem.org/352	New Application	Cells can sense and respond to the presence of various gas molecules such as oxygen, nitrogen and carbon monoxide using gas sensor proteins. CooA is a carbon monoxide (CO) sensing transcription factor. It is a member of the cAMP receptor protein (CRP)/fumavate nitrate reduction (FNR) family of transcriptional regulators. CooA switches on oxidation enzymes in Rhodospirillum rubrum (a purple, nonsulfur, phototrophic bacterium) which enables the bacterium to use CO as a carbon source. CO is an odorless and colorless gas which can be extremely lethal. Our aim is to develop a cell sensor which can detect a wide range of CO concentration in the environment. We are building CooA and CooA-responsive promoter biobricks which will be transformed into E.coli. Fluorescent proteins (GFP and RFP) will be utilized as dose-responsive signals of ambient CO.
https://teams.igem.org/353	Foundational Advance	The majority of sensors currently used in synthetic biology respond to the absolute concentration of a chemical. However, many important biological processes are governed by the ratio between the concentrations of multiple chemicals. To create systems capable of responding to more complex input data, the Stanford team designed two types of ratio-measuring sensors. The first sensor utilizes two unique small RNAs to inhibit the transcription of two operons, each responding to an environmental factor and having a specific flourescent protein (or output gene). By manipulating the number of small RNAs produced, a tipping point between outputs can be established for different input ratios. The second sensor uses a phosphorylatable protein to control the transcription rate of an output promoter. By linearly associating two chemical inputs to the production of a kinase and a phosphatase, the ratio of the two environmental factors indirectly dictates the activity of the output promoter.
https://teams.igem.org/354	Health & Medicine	Whole-cell bacterial biosensors have been developed for a range of applications. In this project, the concept of a whole-cell biosensor has been adapted for medical use as a diagnostic for viral infection through engineering a commensal bacterium. Lactobacilli are the predominant commensal organisms in the human vaginal mucosa and are ideally placed to detect the presence of a sexually transmitted infection, such as Human Papillomavirus. A strain of this bacterium has been modified to produce a chromogenic reporter, which is visible to the naked eye, when 'switched on' through exposure to the input signal (viral infection). However, in order for this to be clearly visible in vivo, this signal needs to be transmitted throughout the entire bacterial population. Thus, this project focused on a) modifying a Gram-positive bacterium to produce the chromogenic reporter; b) using a heterologous quorum-sensing mechanism to propagate an auto-regulated feedback loop amongst a bacterial population.

https://teams.igem.org/356	Health & Medicine	Every year five million people are infected by cholera. An effective vaccine has yet to be found. Our aim is to confer resistance to cholera by taking advantage of quorum-sensing regulated pathogenicity. CAI-1, the cholera autoinducer, is produced by the enzyme, CqsA. E. coli engineered to express CqsA could grow along with regular gut flora and render V. cholerae avirulent by maintaining high CAI-1 concentrations. To lessen its metabolic burden, the system should respond to low concentrations of autoinducer produced by V. cholerae and co-ordinate this response using the Lux quorum-sensing system. We have explored rearranging the network architecture of the Lux system to give bistable expression. A model to describe bistability was formed using ODEs and implemented in C++. To assess the perception of synthetic biology, software was written to gather data from social networking and news sites and quantify the change in opinions with time.
https://teams.igem.org/357	Environment	Oil sands, consisting of a mixture of clay, sand and bitumen represent a significant fraction of remaining petroleum reserves. However, extracting the hydrocarbons requires large volumes of water which are then contaminated with naphthenic acids, heavy metals and residual hydrocarbons. These 'tailings' are acutely toxic to higher organisms, though some bacteria and algae can survive in these environs. Our knowledge of metabolic pathways capable of degrading such contaminants (bioremediation) is limited. However, the known pathways tend to be slow and inefficient. The breakdown of many polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons generates a common intermediate, catechol that is further degraded to Acetyl-CoA. Metabolic channeling is an effect whereby intermediates are shuttled between enzymes in a pathway circumventing free diffusion into the cytosol. Here, we present a design, modeling and baseline experiments aimed at demonstrating optimization of catechol degradation using the principle of metabolic channeling in an E. coli proof of concept system.
https://teams.igem.org/358	Foundational Advance	Genetic engineered cell death is imperative for biotechnological usage, such as bioremediation area. For controlling cell death, we designed 'Lysisbox' consists of a pair of modules: 'Killer gene' and 'Anti-killer gene.' As the Killer gene for E.coli, we noted the lysis cassette [SRRz/Rz1gene] of lambda phage coding for a holin and an endolysin. The holin forms pores in the inner membrane, and the endolysin access to and degrade the peptidoglycan by passing through the pores, leading the E.coli to death. As the Anti-killer gene, we chose S-TMD1 coding for a dominant-negative holin that inhibits the formation of the fatal pores. The balance of these two genes expression level has a key of the E.Coli's life or death. In addition, such controllable membrane pores must show critical functions for all living organisms with lipid membranes. 'Lysisbox' will contribute a lot to future projects, thus you must say 'FANTASTIC!!!'
https://teams.igem.org/359	Health & Medicine	Superbugs, or antibiotic resistant microorganisms, are microbes that have become resistant to traditional treatments. These types of infections are difficult to diagnose, treat, and eradicate, making the healing process time consuming and resource intensive. The native quorum-sensing unit from S.aureus (the Agr system), will be introduced into a non-pathogenic strain of E.coli. The E.coli will then effectively have the ability to eavesdrop on the activity of the pathogenic organism and emit an indication of the magnitude of the infection in the form of RFP. Using sensitivity tuners the system can be designed such that the response will occur at an exact level, when the size of the population poses a threat to the host. Upon a positive result from a diagnosis, further tests could be done to specify whether MRSA (methicillin-resistant S. aureus) or MSSA (Methicillin-sensitive S. aureus) are present.
https://teams.igem.org/360	Village	Synthetic Biology has been enabling changes in all bio-domains, one such being communication. Traditional cellular communication has relied since time immemorial on chemical messengers to exchange information. Regardless of their scope, these messengers are constrained to a system; eg: even far reaching couriers such as hormones are bound within the chemical structure that is the human body. But this is about to change. In this project, our goal is to render the chemical barrier deprecated by using a non-chemical herald: photons. These will transport information between our engineered cells, creating a photon-based inter-cellular communication system. These messengers are produced through bio-luminescent reactions, and are quite capable of traversing multiple environments. This enables the transmission of information beyond the chemical, biological, and even spatial limitations. As the courier is effectively decoupled from the chemical layer, it is an innovative step in establishing communications between organic-based and silicon-based systems, such as computers.
https://teams.igem.org/361	New Application	Data encryption and storage has always been an important branch of research in computer engineering. In our project, we explored the possibility of harnessing a biological system as an alternative solution for data en/decryption and storage. By using E. coli, we engineered and devised a prototype, dubbed E. cryptor, for 1) bio-encryption and -decryption with error checking; and 2) data storage in a bacterial system. In the age of synthetic biology, designed microorganisms may carry a specific DNA barcode to be distinguished from their natural counterparts. Our system could turn such barcode into more than simply a tag. In the future, can we also store text, pictures, and even videos into these tiny bacteria and protect the contents?
https://teams.igem.org/362	New Application	Our team, KIT-Kyoto suggests an 'E.coli Pen' as a new Art Tool. This brand-new pen uses no ink but medium in which genetically modified E.coli has been cultured. The Pen is able to express more than four colors in various intensities with single bacterial culture. This will be achieved by constructing plasmids carrying genes coding for four different fluorescent proteins under the control of seven promoters having different sensitivity to oxidative stress. The E. coli carrying these plasmids will produce different colors with various intensities by differentially responding to the gradient of hydrogen peroxide treatment. Different from previous passive BioArt in iGEM, the genetically engineered 'E. coli Pen' provides an active and wonderful tool for us to purely enjoy the Art having a feeling for biotechnology.
https://teams.igem.org/363	New Application	If the goal of iGEM and the Parts Registry is to take the messy world of genetic engineering and transform it into something like the standardized world of electrical engineering, it may be useful if electronic systems could directly interface with biological systems. Past iGEM projects have used chemical or optical stimuli to actuate transcriptional responses. Our project, however, seeks to add voltage sensitivity to Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Baker's yeast was chosen because in some sense yeast have a system that responds to voltage input. With a voltage stimulus one can open the voltage-gated calcium channels of yeast, causing calcium ions to rush into the cytoplasm. This causes calcineurin to dephosphorylate Crz1, which enters the nucleus and binds various promoters. Our group presents a library of characterized Crz1-sensitive promoters of both naturally-occurring and synthetic varieties. Genes downstream of these promoters are thus voltage-regulated in media containing calcium.
https://teams.igem.org/364	Food & Energy	Eukaryotic synthetic biology has huge potential, yet it is still in need of more diverse molecular tools for defined gene regulation. Nuclear receptors are a conserved family of proteins responsible for sensing lipids; they may be viewed as lipid activated transcription factors. We have successfully developed a kit with a variety of lipid responsive domains (from H.sapines, D.melanogaster and C.elegans) for the rational construction of synthetic transcription factors. The domains respond only to predefined lipids and selectively activate predetermined gene expression. To characterize theses domains, we used standardized protocols for comparable measurements. In vivo gene expression was measured as a function of ligand concentration using luciferase activity. The potential for these tools is immense; e.g. from the ultra sensitive detection of lipid contaminants in the environment to the opportunity of titration specific gene expression canges in patients undergoing gene therapy.
https://teams.igem.org/365	Foundational Advance	The aim of our project is to engineer a new fundamental component that could be universally used to build more complex or more controllable biological circuits inside chassis organisms. This new component consists of the E. coli protease ClpXP to which the phytochrome B (PhyB) of Arabidopsis thaliana is fused. Any given protein can be degraded as long as it is fused with the Phytochrome Interacting Factor (PIF)-degradation tag biobrick. The activity of this system is tightly controlled and switchable by light inducement.
https://teams.igem.org/366	Manufacturing	Our team's project is a 'bio-safety net' that limits the survival of bacteria according to tailored conditions. Bacteria could be designed to perform promising tasks, such as the biodegradation of oil to clean up oil spills. Yet, there are risks associated with the possibility of living bacteria performing undesired activities. Our goal is to introduce a 'bio-safety net' that will be applicable to virtually all genetically engineered bacteria as a vital termination step after their tasks have finished. We have made this possible by introducing a 'suicide' mechanism, that will be triggered under specific conditions. By combining different promoters, the system can respond to changes in environmental factors and control expression specific to chosen factors. Such mechanism can be easily assembled and incorporated to bacteria through the use of biobricks.
https://teams.igem.org/367	New Application	The possibility of specifically targeting bacteria to biological or abiotic surfaces is a promising technology of potential use in therapy, pest control and bioremediation, among others. However, since in most cases bacteria are not drawn towards their targets, the possibility of specific interaction is limited to those bacterial cells that randomly collide with the surface, thus requiring a high bacterial population to achieve efficient targeting. On the other hand, most bacteria are specifically attracted by gradients of a variety of chemicals, thus achieving high cell densities in the areas where the chemoattractants are present at higher concentration. The aim of 'Bacterial Crowding' is to exploit chemotaxis for directing a relatively small population of bacteria to interact efficiently with a non-diffusible target exposed on a biotic or abiotic surface.
https://teams.igem.org/368	Foundational Advance	We are engaged in two projects: Project 'Pathway' involves the creation of an artificial metabolic pathway for the synthesis of azobenzene derivates in E. coli. This would be accomplished by expressing the required enzymes, encased in a proteinaceous bacterial microcompartment. This construct is necessary in order to shield the cell from toxic intermediates which would otherwise make this biosynthesis impossible. Azobenzene derivates are interesting in the field of biochemistry because of their properties as synthetic molecular switches. Project 'ApoControl' is divided into three subprojects on controllable cell-death. The goal is to develop a system to improve the efficiency and specificity of gene expression in eukaryotic cell-lines and more specifically, to select cells expressing the target gene against cells that do not. Here, proapoptotic genes instead of antibiotic resistance are used as a selection marker to induce clean cell-death at different stimuli.
https://teams.igem.org/369	Software Tools	To promote public awareness of synthetic biology and introduce its basic ideas to the laymen, our team devoted to the development of an experimental video game which aims at instructing non-biologists to design and improve biological systems. Following the games-with-a-purpose paradigm in which players help solve scientific problems, we attempt to apply the human brain's puzzle-solving abilities to the complex designs of biological systems. While most of developed simulation tools are designed for experts to model the reaction networks from scratch, our game integrates a modeling environment in which users only need to submit their assembling of parts for our program to discover and generate the biological model automatically. With a mass of data for the use of modeling, we propose the Standard Biological Parts Modeling Database Language, which enables descriptions of complicated biological processes. Furthermore, previous iGEM project models will be featured to demonstrate the availability of our idea.

Imagine if a complex neurological state such as the desire to eat could be influenced by an engineered strain of intestinal microflora. In this regard, Peptide Tyrosine Tyrosine (PYY) and its associated molecules offer a unique opportunity for synthetic biologists. These peptides permit microorganisms native to the gastrointestinal tract to interact with the central nervous system and to influence the perception of hunger. The Citadel-Charleston Team is working to express the PYY family of peptides in E.coli, to implement a secretion pathway for those peptides, and to ensure that their expression is strictly controlled by means of a cellular population limit.
https://teams.igem.org/374	Foundational Advance	The aim of this project is to engineer a genetic bi-stable switch that produces two different, mutually exclusive outputs when given two different inputs. The switch is based on the repressor-anti-repressor system of the salmonella phages Gifsy1 and Gifsy2 and the lambda-phage anti-termination system. The latest induced output will remain stable through generations, even once the input ceases, due to the phage regulatory systems. We present the framework for this development and characterize the regulatory mechanisms by using fluorescent proteins as the reporter (outputs). The dynamics of the system have been modeled and we have also attempted to characterize and submit the promoters, repressors and anti-repressors from the salmonella phages, as well as the two anti-terminator proteins from the lambda phage, as BioBricks. We have hereby demonstrated the engineering of a multipurpose bi-stable switch sensor/reporter tool that can have numerous applications.

We are developing low-cost alternatives to existing hardware and enzymes in an attempt to expand participation in biological research and development. Our project expands the accessibility of Taq Polymerase by engineering it in a form compatible with BioBrick assembly. This allows use of the over-expressed enzyme from a crude bacterial extract in a PCR reaction at a fraction of the cost of highly purified commercial enzyme. In addition, we have developed inexpensive and easily assembled lab equipment such as a gel electrophoresis apparatus and a PCR thermal cycler. Enabling researchers to synthesize their own enzymes and having access to inexpensive tools will allow for increased participation among the DIY-bio community, stretch increasingly scarce educational funds, and allow rapid scale up of large scale gene synthesis projects.
https://teams.igem.org/376	Food & Energy	Oxygen contamination can be a challenge for many anaerobic processes. To monitor these processes we created and oxygen bio-sensor in E. coli which produces an anaerobic fluorescent protein. The task of creating an oxygen bio-sensor is compounded by the fact that oxygen diffusion through many substances is very limited; so oxygen contamination can be undetected due to a response which is too 'soft' . To combat this, we enabled our sensor to induce this response in non-oxygenated bacteria via the lux system; thus amplifying the signal and producing a bio-alarm which is sufficiently 'loud' to not be missed. To accomplish this goal we characterized the response characteristics of the many different Lux components in the parts-distribution. This system can be easily inverted to monitor oxygen depletion in oxygen dependent processes.
https://teams.igem.org/377	Environment	Our team worked on two projects this year. Our first project aims to improve the economics of algal biofuel production by creating a cost efficient microalgae bioflocculant out of E. coli. To achieve this, we over-express Type I pili to increase the cell's adhesiveness, and also express a chlorovirus protein on the cell surface which specifically binds Chlorella species, a promising algal feedstock for the biofuel industry. We are also participating in the Oil Sands Initiative and seeking to improve the biodegradation rate of naphthenic acids (NAs), a toxic by-product of the oil extraction process which can linger in the environment for decades. Two Pseudomonas strains have been found to synergistically degrade 95% of NAs. Our project focuses on engineering these Pseudomonas strains to form biofilms in the harsh tailings water environment, which can potentially increase degradation rates by two orders of magnitude, by expressing a self-associating E. coli protein.

https://teams.igem.org/379	WIKI	The Living Clock project aims to build a biological entity that could process a specific input signal and responds accordingly. We designed a set of concentration detectors that measures different range of the input signal and respond only to a specific concentration interval. By combining and spatio-temporal coordinating such concentration detectors we attempt to construct a biological clock that display time. The concentration band components themselves would work as a quantitative sensor that can work in combination other chemical sensors, such as toxic metals to life saving enzymes, which previous iGEM teams have come up with. Apart from this utility, we believe the concentration band detect sensor in different configurations can allow the creation of complex circuits ranging from simple oscillators to complex data processing machines which can exist on the same system without affecting other components of the system owing to its concentration band specificity.

We have focused on vitiligo in where pigment cells are destroyed, resulting in white patches on the skin. Studies have shown that vitiligo patients have decreased levels of antioxidants and elevated levels of antibodies targeting the pigment cells in the skin. We have used synthetic biology to fuse cell-penetrating peptides to proteins that are deficient in skin of vitiligo patients. The cell-penetrating peptides will aid in passing the proteins through the skin and target the pigment cells to reach repigmentation. Currently there are no treatments like ours for vitiligo patients. However, we strongly believe that synthetic biology can help bacteriotherapy getting a major role in fighting several skin disorders in the future, and that our first explorations in this field inspires others to continue exploring.

https://teams.igem.org/385	Village	A novel genetic toggle switch regulated at the translational level was engineered in yeast that allowed the mutually exclusive expression of either green or cyan fluorescent protein. Using cell cytometry (FACS) and fluorimetry, we demonstrated in yeast the successful expression and translational regulation of a fusion of mRNA binding protein and fluorescent protein. These results, along with published parameter values, were used to predict via deterministic and stochastic models that the probability of successful bistability for our switch was 0.96%, but this could be improved theoretically to a maximum of 51.27% by limiting the range of variation of the most sensitive parameters. The models also predicted that co-operative binding of the mRNA binding protein to its mRNA stem loop was essential for generating switch-like behaviour. These results suggest that a translationally regulated genetic toggle switch is a viable and novel engineering concept applicable to medicinal, environmental and technological problems.
https://teams.igem.org/386	Environment	The Sheffield iGEM 2010 team organised its activities around a general theme: 'identification'. This notion, for instance, is at the heart of the scientific and modeling projects, which have made steps towards the design and production of a multi-target, water-borne pathogen detection system. Identification is also central to the human practices projects, which explicated and analysed the concept of identity in relation to the disciplinary backgrounds brought together in the project and the field of synthetic biology itself. Vibrio cholera was chosen as a test-case, giving us two potential routes to engineer E.coli to recognise the pathogen: 1. Fusion of cholera's receptor (CqsS) for its quorum sensing molecule (CAI-1) with the internal apparatus of one of E.coli's general stress detecting systems (BarA). 2. Engineer the whole cholera quorum sensing system into E.coli.Each of these would then be connected to a representation system (GFP or E.chromi) to visualize the pathogen.
https://teams.igem.org/387	Health & Medicine	Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic disease in which joint matrix is degraded and chondrocytes undergo disordered and hypertrophic differentiation, symptoms including joint pain, tenderness and stiffness. We proposed two synthetic-biological approaches to OA, one with a eukaryotic genetic circuit and another prokaryotic. Both circuits are composed of three systems: 'Detector', 'Actuator' and 'Supervisor'. As for Detector, we built tissue-specific promoters in the eukaryotic circuit, while inflammation factors are employed as signals of OA in the prokaryotic circuit. The same Actuator shared by two circuits generates proteins col2a1, which replenishes the degraded matrix, and oct4, which reverses the disordered differentiation. The eukaryotic Supervisor part has an original design in which a photo-sensitive cation channel crosstalks with certain cellular signaling pathways, resulting in the light-controlled expression of col2a1 and oct4; in the counterpart of prokaryotic circuit, both injected inducers and over-population lead the engineered bacteria to suicide, thus attenuating possible side effects.

The intention is to make the spiciness in fare visible using a gradient light signal. The original receptor is the acetosyringone detection system of Agrobacterium tumefaciens. By using directed evolution, we aim to modulate the receptor binding domain to enable the interaction with similar phenolic substances like capsaicin. Brought into E. coli, this modulated system will induce light effects of different intensities - depending on the concentration of capsaicin respectively the spiciness of the sample. The capsaicin detection is a proof of principle concept. We aim to establish a system, which is characterized by a high sensitivity and specifity and is capable to replace slow and high priced diagnostics or analytic methods. The targets of the system could be allergy-triggers, explosives and toxins.

We developed a BioBrick vector that can be used to assemble parts and devices in E. coli. Upon transformation into Synechocystis, it integrates the device directly into the genome through homologous recombination. We utilized genes that were activated under a variety of conditions, from those responding to heat stress to ones oscillating under a circadian rhythm. The promoters and ribosome binding sites were converted into BioBrick-compatible parts, and subsequently characterized. Our success will enable the use of existing parts in new species, and will expand the range of devices that can be built.
https://teams.igem.org/391	Village	Biofilms are ubiquitous microbial communities that often display greater resistance and pathogenicity compared to individual microbes. Biofilms commonly cause complications in both industrial and medical settings and represent a significant source of morbidity and mortality. A synthetic biology approach to tackling biofilms has only recently been applied to Escherichia coli biofilms. To eliminate the more clinically relevant Staphylococcus aureus biofilms, our team aims to break new ground at iGEM by using S. aureus as a model host and developing a standard for genetically engineering bacteriophages. Our design incorporates DspB, a biofilm matrix-degrading enzyme into the _13 phage genome, which is altered to operate under the regulation of the S. aureus agr quorum sensing pathway and thus upon contact with biofilms. As a complement, we have also developed a mathematical model that simulates the dynamics of our system under different conditions.
https://teams.igem.org/392	WIKI	Desertification all over the world causes famine, drought and suffering. We aim to develop micro-machines that can stop and even reverse desertification by recovering vegetation in these areas. We envison a 'Continuous Greening Cycle' in which engineered microorganisms decompose plant fibers into nutrients through the action of cellulolytic enzymes. They then produce water-absorbant polymers such as poly(gamma-glutamic) acid that retain water in the soil to help plants grow. When the plants die they will be decomposed to start the cycle anew. In addition to aiming for the continuous and self-expanding greening of desert areas, we hope to contribute to iGEM by developing useful BioBricks!
https://teams.igem.org/393	Manufacturing	What does it take to make bacteria produce an electrical circuit? One of the most exciting uses for synthetic biology is in the design of biological systems that can replace and improve industrial processes. By achieving industrial goals using biological processes, we predict dramatic reductions in economic and environmental manufacturing costs. Our project is a first step towards biologically synthesized electronic circuits. Based on precedence of naturally redox-capable bacteria, we generated a system in E. coli that reduces metal in solution. Depending on the application, this system has the ability to form a conductive copper sulfide that can be localized with high precision. In the future our bacteria could catalyze metal deposition to form electrical circuits of any desired dimension and complexity.
https://teams.igem.org/394	Foundational Advance	Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a model unicellular eukaryotic chassis; however when compared with Escherichia coli the available synthetic biology tools are lacking. To remedy this problem the 2010 Washington University iGEM team has introduced a synthetic alternative splicing tool, as well as designed and produced new BioBricks parts to ease transformation of synthetic constructs into S. cerevisiae. A mutually exclusive exon splicing system was formulated in which Sex-lethal interacts with the native splicing machinery to affect splice site choice. Two vectors have been designed to facilitate simple bacterial BioBrick manipulation and subsequent chromosomal integration into the yeast genome. A yeast positive selection marker BioBrick has been produced for the first time. Chromosomal integration with positive selection will stabilize and streamline BioBrick transformations into S. cerevisiae. A synthetic splicing assembly will allow for new synthetic biology techniques such as isoform engineering of proteins or combinatorial logic.
https://teams.igem.org/395	Information Processing	Have you heard the legend of 'The Wolfman'? They're ordinary man at daytime, but suddenly transform into a ferocious wolf in the full-moon night. Our project aim to imitate the character of Wolfman, more specifically, designing two types of E.coli that help each other to survive at daytime, whereas competing at nighttime when cocultured. Firstly, two cells have different types of antibiotic-resistance, however this expression is repressed in absence of outer stimulation. Two factors of stimulation, cell density and light, are required at once to activate the antibiotic resistance. We took advantage of photoregulation system (Cph1-EnvZ) to make sure downstream promoter is activated with light. This promoter is followed by circuit designed to sense the cell density of its counterpart and activate the counterpart cell's antibiotic-resistant gene. With this entire system, we could observe the 'Wolfman' Coli in our laboratory working by AND gate of two stimulation.
https://teams.igem.org/396	New Application	We daily double-click the icons to open the files or to exert the program: this is clearly distinguished from the single click, which is often for selecting or highlighting the program. This year, iGEM CHIBA is constructing genetic double-click system whose output is released only when the input (inducing agent) is given twice within a limited time. To discriminate double-click from two separated single-clicks, the 1st input is to be memorized temporarily. If the 2nd input is added before the memory gets lost, output will be produced. If the 2nd input is not added within the given time, the system will be reset to the original state. This mechanism could work as a sort of safety device; by requiring the 2nd 'confirmation' input, one can drastically reduce, or even eliminate, the frequency of false-inputs. This system could be useful in operating the potent or potentially-hazardous biochemical processes.

https://teams.igem.org/398	Environment	Pollution of soil and water environments by crude oil has been, and is still today, an important environmental issue. This was once more confirmed with the oil-spill in the Gulf of Mexico, but is also an issue that has to be faced continuously during the process of oil extraction from oil sands. Cleaning has proven to be challenging, but synthetic biology may hold the key to sustainable bio-remedial solutions for the future. What if we could design a small, autonomous, self-replicating, inexpensive method to remove oil from aqueous environments? The TU Delft iGEM 2010 team spent their summer designing a system that can tolerate, sense, dissolve & degrade hydrocarbons in aqueous environments, which could open new doors for the oil-industry.
https://teams.igem.org/399	Health & Medicine	Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are natural secretions by gram-negative bacteria that can transport various proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids in interactions with mammalian host cells. OMV technology presents an affordable, non-toxic, and direct method of drug delivery and antigen tracking. We have designed a method for visualizing the interactions of mammalian cells with outer membrane vesicles by utilizing the ClyA surface protein as an attachment site for fluorescent proteins. The current goal of this project is to characterize the distribution of varying ClyA-fluorescent protein complexes on OMVs. Future work will be to develop a tracking system employing a ClyA-fluorescent protein construct for in vitro microscope imaging. An antibody fragment will also be attached to another ClyA complex, allowing the OMV tracking system to target specific regions of an organism. This method allows in vitro characterization of OMVs and provides integral data for developing a future OMV delivery platform in vivo.
https://teams.igem.org/400	Environment	Toxic heavy metals such as arsenic, zinc, and cadmium in water are very harmful. Detecting these heavy metals is an important task. So we designed a heavy-metal-detecting E. coli. In order to design the system, we employed two fluorescence proteins (GFP, RFP) and aryl acylamidase as signal reporters. The aryl acylamidase converts a colorless acetaminophen(Tylenol TM) to a brown color substrate. Since the detecting E. coli has three heavy metal promoters, if more than two heavy metals coexist in a solution, the E. coli emit mixed fluorescence, so we simultaneously detect metals. Our goal is to synthetic modules put these three genes for different heavy metals in a row in E. coli and then utilized in the form of a lyophilized powder, which can be stored in a drug capsule to make it portable so that analysis of water is easily processed. We call it a 'Capsule Cop'.
https://teams.igem.org/401	Food & Energy	We present an intermediate scenario in the pathway towards Mars Terraformation. The project is focused in two essential conditions on this process: Increase the planet temperature, resistance of microorganism to thermal changes. The proposal is that dark yeast cells retain the arriving radiation and heat the surface. But, once the temperature reaches its optimum on the planetary surface the color production should be switched off. In order to achieve that and taking advantage of Synthetic Biology principles, a switch based on prion proteins (on mad yeast!) will be used. The work will be complemented with the implementation of the expression of LEA (late embryogenesis abundant) 'antifreeze' protein. Summarizing, we are going to build a engineered yeast resistant to temperature changes and able to produce a dark pigment which will be the responsible of a global temperature increase on Mars.
https://teams.igem.org/402	Software Tools	While former iGEM software teams were mainly focusing on the assembly of biobricks into a predictable system, our software Bach targets at the coding sequence of biobrick itself. We first built a mathematical model to quantitatively predict RIPS (ribosome initiation per sec) of any given coding sequence in any organism. We then constructed three modules (synonymous substitution, optimization and RIPS design) to process input coding sequences. Bach could recompose the input sequence into an output one that better suits the host organism and performs the specific translational rate of desire. In this way, the discordant tunes of codon bias in biobricks from different genetic backgrounds could be synchronized, and the realization of a more predictable and robust system would be possible. Our work not only benefits current works involving exogenous protein expression, but also makes a big step towards standardization and characterization of biobricks.

https://teams.igem.org/404	Village	Gene delivery using viral vectors holds great promise for the treatment of acquired and inherited diseases. The human Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV) is a small, non-pathogenic, single-stranded DNA virus gaining increasing attention being both versatile and effective. Taking current knowledge into account, we generated a recombinant, modularized, BioBrick-compatible AAV 'Virus Construction Kit'. We provide parts for modified capsid proteins, targeting modules, tumor-specific promoters, and prodrug-activating enzymes as well as readily assembled vectors for gene delivery and production of non-replicative virus particles. The viral tropism is altered by N-terminal fusion or by loop replacement of the capsid proteins. Functionality of viruses constructed from our kit was demonstrated by fluorescent protein expression in infected cells and by prodrug-induced killing of tumor cells upon viral delivery of a thymidine kinase. Incorporating multiple layers of safety, we provide a general tool to the growing field of personalized medicine and demonstrate its use in tumor therapy.

SynBioWave enables research collaboration by real-time sharing of parts, design and documentation. Moreover, biologists can record and share the process of creating research data. Last year our team developed the basic SynBioWave robot.

We also provide the 'blueprint-robot', a framework easing new robot development. Furthermore, we are adding new functionality by creating add-on robots that perform tasks such as BLAST-searches, ORF-finding, translation, sequence alignments and restriction site mapping.

https://teams.igem.org/407	WIKI	SensorBricks is a reliable and modular system for antigen recognition, signal amplification and quantification. Initial steps of SensorBricks will focus on the detection of CD33 and other leukemic markers to increase diagnostic stringency. There are three major components in SensorBricks: (i) monoclonal antibodies that bind to an antigen of interest, (ii) a LuxI-Protein A fusion construct which non-specifically binds antibodies and produces the autoinducer N- Acyl homoserine lactone (AHL), and (iii) a Escherichia coli based biosensor which strongly amplifies the production of a fluorescence protein in the presence of AHL. By coupling signal detection to a genetic circuit, we would be able to amplify the signal in a quantifiable manner, allowing the identification of cancer markers expressed in minute quantities.
https://teams.igem.org/408	New Application	The use of bacteria for sensing applications has been around for a while now, and they have been used to produce recombinant proteins as needed for even longer time. The current project focuses on integrating these two components to create a device capable of responding to external stimuli in the form of quantitative protein production. For this device to function, it needed to be capable of producing and secreting the protein extracellularly. Further the dynamics of elicitor interaction with the bacteria in a flow stream and concomitant product release have also been a part of the study. We believe that such a system can play a major role in drug delivery systems that treat as needed and further in creating artificial glands for diseases such as insulin.

https://teams.igem.org/410	Manufacturing	Alternative Oxidase (AOX) is a terminal oxidase protein found in the respiratory chain of various organisms ranging from aquatic prokaryotes to plants and animals. In the AOX pathway, electrons are transferred from ubiquonone to AOX, and then directly used to reduce oxygen. The drop in the electric potential energy of the electrons transferred from AOX to oxygen is dissipated as heat. Our project has focused on 1) cloning the AOX gene from a thermogenic plant (Sacred Lotus) into E. coli to induce a thermogenic response to a cold-shock, and 2) calculating a theoretical rate of heat production per bacterial colony to select for an appropriate calorimetric technique. Further, numerical methods in MATLAB will be employed to model the steady-state temperature profile of the synthetic bacterial colony, and to potentially corroborate later experimental findings. Engineering a controlled thermogenic response in bacteria could lead to improved bacterial functioning in cold shock environments.

Our goal is to speed up the reporting response of bacterial gene expression through shortening the time needed for routine iGEM experiments. We intend to construct systems aimed at reducing experimental time and increasing efficiency of construction production. To achieve the goal, our design process is split up into three parts: Riboswitch, mRNA Binding, and SsrA. (1) Riboswitch - faster production of proteins by inducing the translation of pre-transcribed RNA molecules. (2) mRNA Binding - using mRNA aptamers and split GFP/RFP-eIF4A reporter systems to show faster promoter activity or the expression of mRNA transcripts. (3) SsrA - fast, specific, and constitutive proteolysis achieved by engineering fluorescent proteins with LVA tags.

One, we want our highlight to be the first team to provide the iGEM registry with stress-inducible promoters to be used in plants. These promoters can be valuable tools in monitoring the environment for salt, heavy metals, temperature, and more. Second, we want to develop a real-time monitoring model of these stress-inducible promoters by having fluorescent reporters linked to their expression. Current research typically uses microarray, a technique that takes a 'snapshot' of a system, where as we want to hold a 'video camera' up to specific genes. Third, we will show the advantages of using Nicotiana tabacum protoplasts (NT cells). Our NT cell system provides a faster, cheaper, and safer method of obtaining a transgenic plant model than transforming an actual plant, benefits future iGEM teams may want to take into consideration.
https://teams.igem.org/415	Manufacturing	Our goal is to produce adaptive, living biomaterials that can be reliably controlled in two different systems: mammalian cells and bacteria. Our mammalian system uses newly isolated mechano-sensing promoters and a bi-stable toggle to stimulate osteogenesis via transient mechanical signals. Our bacterial system uses a toggle that takes advantage of quorum sensing and cell response to UV light and triggers the production of fluorescent proteins, and a polymer composed of a matrix of cross-linked phage. Our systems are remarkable because they translate a macroscale input into a pattern that emerges from the growth and re-modeling of cells. This technology not only has applications in the field of self-repairing nanotechnology and medicine, but it is also shedding light on artificial differentiation and the use of phage display technology in a new and innovative way.

Our hope is to demonstrate the feasibility of using the yeast cell to not only discover antibodies but to provide a streamlined processing unit that can quickly and easily transition from antibody discovery to protein production.

Current methods of production are energy intensive, and rely on processing of non-renewable fossil fuels. However many plants produce ethylene from L-methionine by use of the Yang cycle, which has lower energy requirements. We aim to introduce the genes that are required for ethylene production into Escherichia coli under the control of an inducible promoter, in an attempt to develop a cleaner and non-energy intensive method of production. At lower yields, this device may also provide a useful module for signal transduction between the E. coli and plants.
https://teams.igem.org/418	Manufacturing	Chitin, found in the exoskeletons of insects and crustaceans, is one of the most abudant substances in nature. Like keratin in skin, it comprises the protective outer layer of these animals. Our chitin expression platform involves generating a layer of chitin from a lawn of bacteria in response to an external molecular cue. This cue induces chitin synthesis (fast) and cell lysis (slow). This system allows for a build-up of chitin followed by cell lysis and subsequent release into the top layer of the lawn. Abrasions expose cells to the external cue for self-repair. In this way, we create a regenerative chitin biolayer with potential medical and industrial applications.

We aim to create a synthetic biological device to produce nutrient for people who needed. The device contains sensing, synthesis, and lysis system which is operated in E.coli. When the device senses appropriate signal, it will activate synthesis system to produce nutrient. When products reach a critical mass, the lysis system will take over to release nutrient. We take_-carotene as one of our source of nutrient, as it is the precursor of vitamin A. 40 millions people worldwide suffer night blindness each year because vitamin A deficiency. In our device, we use hydrophobic promoter as our sensing system (_-carotene is lipid soluble), and lysogenic enzyme as our lysis system. Our next step is to transform our synthesizer to lactobacillus which is harmless to human so we could solve the global food crisis problem.

C.elegans live on a diet of a variety of bacteria, E.coli being such strain. Genetically-modified E.coli can be fed to C.elegans which can then express any double stranded RNA of interest. The dsRNA can knock off specific genes in C.elegans. In our experiments, we are using C.Elegans as a marker to expres a range of external factors in two sets, temperature and IPTG. On a utilitarian level, our project investigates the use of C.elegans as a visual marker for changes in environmental conditions. On a more critical level, C.elegans is used to study the consequences of interactions between engineered organisms and the 'natural' world.

In wild type E. coli flagella movement is controlled by proteins of the chemotaxis pathway, so called Che proteins. In our engineered cells one of these Che proteins is fused to a synthetic light-sensitive localization system. Two external inputs - red light and far red light - induce the relocation of the fused proteins, thus reversibly changing flagella movement direction. Cells, imaged by bright field microscopy, are automatically detected and tracked while a closed loop controller guides the cell into a user defined direction by autonomously sending light inputs.

Rhamnolipids as biosurfactants are important in the remediation of oil spill areas. The cleanup of the Exxon Valdez oil spill using rhamnolipids as biosurfactants was too expensive and complicated, therefore impractical for large-scale bioremediation. However, with advances genetic engineering and synthetic biology offer a viable solution to oil spill pollution clean up. In this project we use genetic engineering as a tool to integrate genetic parts through the BioBrick assembly standard protocol of iGEM to develop a BioBrick for rhamnosiltransferase 1 complex (rhlAB) gene expression in Escherichia coli for standardized rhamnolipid production. Our BioBrick integrates a promoter, a RBS (ribosomal binding site), our part rh1AB gene sequence isolated from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a GFP reporter and a terminator. All the parts fit into a plasmid backbone that can be transformed into E. coli strains, which can then produce rhamnolipids.

https://teams.igem.org/426	New Application	Single-celled phagocytic eukaryotes like Choanoflagellates are of great interest to developmental biologists because they may be the last living immediate precursor on the evolutionary tree to animals. These easy to culture and robust organisms are also a desirable eukaryotic chassis for synthetic biology, but there are few tools for delivering biomolecules into these organisms. So, we engineered E. coli to deliver proteins and/or DNA payloads into these bacteria-devouring eukaryotes. Once ingested, our E. coli are programmed to self-lyse and porate the phagosome, releasing their payloads into the cytosol. This delivery mechanism has the potential to deliver payload to any phagocytic organism with a cholesterol-based membrane. As part of our parallel software effort to rework the Clotho plugin environment and API, we made automatic biosafety handling an intrinsic feature of the core. Together, these tools provide a foundation for metazoan synthetic biology and a framework for improving safety in our field.
https://teams.igem.org/427	Environment	Bacterial reporters or whole-cell bacterial sensors have always been an area of application for genetic manipulation and synthetic biology. The first bacterial reporters appeared 20 years ago, although these early tests didn't use genetically modified microorganisms. Further research and development in the area of genetic engineering has resulted in newer and more sophisticated bacterial sensors, capable of detecting the presence of contaminants, sugars and amino acids in different media such as soil and water. However, most bacterial sensors can only detect the presence of a compound at a certain concentration and currently there are few documented bacterial sensors that can detect and report different concentrations of the compound of interest. Our objective was to develop a genetic frame, compatible with the BioBrick standard, for the creation of a concentration-sensitive bacterial sensor. In the process we also developed and characterized BioBricks for two new families of phage activators.

Furthermore, we intend to apply such transistors to function as signal amplifiers due to the ultrasensitive responses that can be generated in this mechanism. For the application of this project and others, we are also developing a high throughput gene expression screen for synthetic gene libraries and codon variants, allowing for the possibility of tunable gene expression levels.

The purpose of this project is to provide a tool box of parts necessary for the genetic manipulation of this organism. These parts include a variety of promoter systems, multiple selectivity options, and a plasmid backbone. In addition, the tool box will be used to produce a flu virus antigen in P. pastoris as a representation of the applicability of this system. These contributions will enable future users to maximize the use and further explore the incredible potential P. pastoris has to offer.

More precisely, we aim at the development and experimental demonstration of a scalable approach for the realization of logical functions in vivo. By developing a computational biological network based on RNA logical devices we will offer everyone the opportunity to 'program' their own cells with individual AND/OR/NOT connections between BioBricks of their choice. Thereby, BioBricks can finally fulfill their original assignment as biological parts that can be connected in many different ways.

Because it will not involve usage of pathogenic strains, it will be safer to use. To transfer T3SS functionally from Salmonella to E.coli it is essential to integrate at least 40kb of DNA fragment coding more than 20 proteins.

Our aim is to engineer a novel, reversible molecular 'light switch' within E. coli by introducing a photoreceptor from non-photosynthetic bacteria (Deinococcus radiodurans and Agrobacterium tumafaciens). By cloning the bacteriophytochrome coupled with heme- oxygenase, an enzyme producing biliverdin, the created colonies are able to respond to red and far-red light environments. This novel approach will result in the colour of E. coli to 'switch' from blue to green reversibly.

https://teams.igem.org/509	New Application	There are challenges using plants in iGEM namely growth time and the complexity with adapting synthetic biology approaches for plants. However plants are a major focus of synthetic biology due to their potential use in an array of applications from food security to synthesis of biofuels. The short time scale of the iGEM competition has often meant that plant based projects are challenging and there have been very few in previous years. As the first iGEM team at UEA and in co-operation with the JIC we felt that we could make a significant contribution to plant based synthetic biology. The overall aim of our project is to help develop and where possible pioneer some of the fundamental technologies and methodologies needed to make plant based synthetic biology projects possible. To achieve this we hope to adapt existing synthetic biology approaches which are successful in Escherichia coli for use in plants.""
https://teams.igem.org/510	New Application	The core of our project is the development of molecular systems that reproduce the behavior of an electronic flip-flop, allowing the construction of living memory devices closer to the robustness of informatics. Several iGEM teams based their work on the construction or use of biological flip-flop systems, with more problems than expected. The UPO-Sevilla team considers the design, construction and improvement of this type of systems, encompassing different regulation levels (transcription, translation, protein proteolysis and epigenetic regulation) in different model organisms, from bacteria to yeast. We leverage our informatics knowledge to improve biological systems, so we can control precisely the cellular machinery.<BR><BR>In addition, we intend to develop a Foundational Advance for Synthetic Biology: the miniTn7 BioBrick toolkit, a transposon-based system to integrate BioBricks into microbial genomes. And a Software tool: the BioBrick Creator, to facilitate the design of BioBrick sequences and their inclusion in the Parts Registry.

Fortunately nature has provided us with robust cellular systems capable of governing the autonomous formation of complex structures. To pursue control of multicellular systems we engineered a number of ligand-receptor signaling mechanisms: the Notch-Delta juxtacrine signaling pathway and an assortment of G-Protein Coupled Receptors. Both signaling systems were modified to activate orthogonal genetic circuits allowing for processing and integration of numerous signals. In order to facilitate and maintain pattern formation we introduced cadherin a natural intercellular glue. To understand and predict multicellular behavior we developed a simulation framework based on the Synthetic Biology Open Language and CompuCell 3D modeling environment. Our models motivated several circuit designs we subsequently tested in the laboratory. Altogether our developments establish a paradigm for manipulation of intercellular communication systems to drive self-organization of tissues.""
https://teams.igem.org/512	Foundational Advance	Bacteria protect their genome and remove foreign DNA through a primitive immune-like system called clustered-regularly-interspaced-short-palindromic-repeats (CRISPR). Plasmids commonly used in molecular biology are mobile genetic elements that facilitate horizontal gene transfer in the wild and enable the spreading of antibioticresistance genes between microorganisms. Plasmids contain unique DNA sequences that can be targeted by the CRISPR system. We exploited this system by engineering E.coli with an inducible mechanism of self-curing plasmid based antibiotic resistance. We synthesized a version of CRISPR encoding a spacer that matches the GFP DNA sequence. We tested the synthetic CRISPR array against E.coli harboring a tetO::GFP plasmid that confers ampicillin resistance. Activation ofCRISPER-gfp destroys the gfp-containing plasmid restoring the bacterial host's sensitivity to ampicillin. We will use the synthetic CRISPR system as a biological tool combining it with other BioBricks for use in applications that will impact health and medicine biotechnology molecular biology and genetics.""

https://teams.igem.org/514	Foundational Advance	We propose a new standard in order to do synthetic biology at a higher level of abstraction, above the biobrick. Our intention is to define a universal substance (Ubbit) for communication between modules of bacteria. Each module is composed of different transformed bacterial strains that work co-ordinately so that the whole module performs a logic operation based on a binary code. Having a unique communication substance means there's no need to understand how the modules work or what's inside, the only important thing is knowing which operation it performs and the inputs and outputs it has. This would allow us to build bigger circuits with different modules that could carry out more complex operations.

This plant hormone will promote root growth which is essential for anchoring soil. <BR><BR>The second module rewires the chemotactic mobility of the cell by introducing a novel receptor protein which is sensitive to root exudates. The bacteria can then be naturally taken up by root cells for targeted auxin delivery. The final module uses a toxin-antitoxin system to prevent horizontal gene transfer. While the plasmid containing the AuxIn system can be maintained inside our chassis it will induce lysis in any other bacteria.<BR><BR>By improving root growth the AuxIn system provides a synthetic biology approach to tackling worldwide problems such as soil erosion and desertification.

https://teams.igem.org/516	Information Processing	Our work aims at implementing the engineering concept of closed-loop control in E. coli exploiting quorum sensing. As a proof of concept we designed a simple genetic controller that regulates the concentration of 3OC6-HSL signalling molecule around a user-defined set-point. The controlled variable (3OC6-HSL) increases as a function of the exogenous anhydroTetracycline input that triggers LuxI expression. The controller senses the 3OC6-HSL concentration and activates the production of AiiA that degrades it.<BR>To observe the desired behaviour a fine tuning of the system was necessary. The transcriptional/translational strength of the regulatory elements (promoter+RBS in several combinations) and the enzyme activities were measured and exploited to identify a mathematical model able to predict the behaviour of the controlled system. These predictions made possible an in silico rational fine tuning of the circuit: the most promising modules were selected and assembled into the final circuit avoiding a cost and time expensive combinatorial approach.

https://teams.igem.org/518	Manufacturing	Bio-systems as a means for environmental remediation have been extensively investigated. However, these devices have often been limited by the requirement of a high cell density at the target site in order to achieve higher efficiencies. To overcome this, we devise an inducible self- assembling system in Escherichia coli utilizing L-aspartate (L-Asp) chemotaxis. Our system consists of two cell types: 'guiders' and 'workers'. When exposed to a signal, the former discharge and generate a signal-centered spatial L-Asp gradient, and the latter lose motility by repression of a flagellum-regulating gene (cheZ). These cells remain at the source of the signal and cannot escape. Using E. coli-derived stress-sensitive promoters cloned de novo, we provide evidence that our system enables auto-assembly and localization after exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Since the input can be varied to other inducible promoters, we anticipate that our system to greatly enhance the potential of engineered cellular machineries.

A bacterial micro-compartment (BMC) was engineered into our E. coli micromachine to act as a tank to accumulate heavy metals. Heavy metal ions such as Zn2+ Cd2+ and As2+ that are taken up by the cell will be trapped inside the tank by a metallothionein fused to a BMC-localizing tag. Using BMC in such a way will be very advantageous as it may achieve the accumulation of high concentrations of heavy metals in one place. The EcoLion that has stored heavy metals will be conveniently collected by light using phototaxis or self-aggregation. This EcoLion may ultimately be applied for collecting a number of different toxic or valuable molecules by using specific target-binding peptides or proteins.""

https://teams.igem.org/524	New Application	Adding to the already massive arsenal of bacteria highly-resistant (HR) /E. coli/ are found to be capable of supporting less-resistant (LR) individuals experiencing antibiotic stress through indole signalling - allowing LR individuals to survive in antibiotic concentrations that would otherwise be lethal. Our team has engineered disruptor /E. coli/ expressing mutated toluene-4-monooxygenase which facilitates indole degradation. Introducing this disruptor strain into an /E. coli/ culture of HR and LR individuals is thus hypothesized to result in massive LR cell death at a lower-than-expected antibiotic concentration. If successful indole degradation may become a possible strategy in boosting antibiotics effectiveness in medical practices against bacteria relying on similar signalling methods. We are also constructing a novel strain of /E. coli/ that utilizes an essential gene (/nadE/) for antibiotic-free transformation and plasmid maintenance. This strain can help future iGEM teams reduce their antibiotics consumption without deviating significantly from widely used transformation protocols. ""

Therefore we worked with S-layers (crystalline bacterial surface layers) which build up well-defined nanosurfaces and can be attached to the surface of beads. As an example we are developing a cell-free bisphenol A (BPA) biosensor based on a coupled enzyme reaction fused to S-layer proteins for everyday use. BPA is a supposedly harmful substance which is e.g. used in the production of polycarbonate. To detect BPA it is degraded by a fusion protein under formation of NAD+ which is detected by a NAD+-dependent enzymatic reaction with a molecular beacon.

However release of these microbes to the open environment would pose increasing threat to the society due to the possibility of changes expected in the indigenous microbial population. Hence we have engineered a synthetic self-killing system for the famous industrial workhorse Escherichia coli. High temperature (370C) native quorum sensing molecule (AI-2) and the darkness present in the fermentor will keep the self-killing system turned off. Environmental signals such as low temperature (25 0C) foreign quorum sensing molecules and light encountered by the E. coli outside of the fermentor would trigger the self-killing device. Unlike other lysis device we have introduced a novel self-killing device that chops up the DNA. Thus this system would not only favor cell death but also ensure that all the genetic materials are destroyed and guarantee that there would be no horizontal gene transfer.""

Moreover we have measured the RBS parts with various fluorescent proteins and they are not as standard as we would like them to be. The strength of a RBS part depends on the protein used. Why? Because the beginning of the protein influences the mRNA fold. We came up with the idea of RBS parts fused with short 'protein beginnings' - expression adapters. Using genetic algorithm we designed expression adapters that would provide standardized protein expression or increase expression of your favorite protein. We are testing our design in the wet lab.

Two riboswitches were used to control the translation of a CheZ fluorescent protein fusion the first sensitive to theophylline and the second to atrazine. Fluorometry was used to prove the activation of the riboswitches. A theophylline concentration of 1.5mM resulted in the highest expression of the fusion protein.

Our system is based on a comparison between an unknown mercury concentration and a known IPTG concentration. A linear IPTG gradient is present on a test-strip containing the engineered bacteria. When the mercury solution is added, the regulatory network will switch to one of two states depending on the IPTG/mercury ratio. Bacteria become either 'sender' or 'receiver'. The bacteria sensing a predominance of mercury over IPTG, the 'senders', will release a quorum sensing molecule which is detected by the nearby 'receivers'. The reception of quorum sensing molecules will induce the expression of a red dye in the 'receivers'. In this way, a red line emerges at a position in the IPTG gradient from which the unknown mercury concentration can be deduced.

Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of iGEM is to link biology and engineering sciences, we'd like to implement an easy way to manage those simple steps in biological systems.<BR><BR>Unfortunately, in E. coli, it's still difficult to assemble or delete in one step, because there is a lack of genetic tools to execute homologous recombination with linear DNA. By the assembly of a unique plasmid containing different phages' genes, and the design and construction of helper plasmids, we aim to provide the iGEM community with a system that would confer to E. coli the useful properties of controlled homologous recombination.<BR><BR>We called this plasmid for insertion and deletion of genes : Pindel.
https://teams.igem.org/552	Food & Energy	Vitamin A deficiency causes blindness in over 250,000 children annually. The WashU iGEM team hopes to address this issue by creating a transgenic strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast) that produces beta-carotene, the precursor to vitamin A. The WashU team created four DNA constructs for homologous recombination into the S. cerevisiae genome that will catalyze the production of beta-carotene. Each construct consisted of a gene encoding an enzyme from Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous, a bacterium that produces beta-carotene. Three of the constructs encode for enzymes in the metabolic pathway required for beta-carotene production, while a fourth enzyme cleaves beta-carotene to form beta-ionone, a rose-scented compound used in the fragrance industry. Additionally, the WashU team has established spectraphotometric assays to detect beta-carotene and beta-ionone in yeast extract. Although we have yet to successfully incorporate these four genes into S. cerevisiae, we have prepared all four constructs and biobricked these genes for future use.
https://teams.igem.org/553	New Application	The synbiome project exploits synthetic biology to obtain a synthetic stable community of eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. Two different bacterial strains 'A','â€˜B' and one eukaryotic cell type 'C' will be engineered to establish mutualism: 'A' produces a N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) sensed by 'B', which in turn produces a different AHL sensed by 'A'. In addition, both bacterial cells activate, through AHL, an enzyme necessary to convert cellobiose to glucose, which represents the only energy source for the whole consortium. The eukaryotic cell 'C' responds to AHL through a hybrid protein, thereby producing a secreted beta-lactamase, which allows the bacterial cells to grow in the presence of ampicillin. The creation of a consortium of inter-dependent cells from different kingdoms is expected to pave the way to multiple applications, since different cells might cooperate and, for instance, better produce complex molecules.

This can lead to bacterial evasion of host defense systems and susceptibility to some pathogens. Since nowadays we are exposed to continuously stress perhaps we can avoid the negative effects caused by this condition. Thus a mechanism that counteracts this imbalance is highly desirable. The ability of some bacteria to sense stress hormones such as Catecholamines will be used to produce Interleukin-12 and inducing Th1 lineage. On the other hand the ability to sense Nitric-Oxide released in inflammatory conditions will be used to trigger Interleukin-10 production counteracting excessive immunity. A switch control system will sustain the balance. The 'Jedi Bacteria' containing these devices would be a useful probiotic to fight against the battle imposed by stress.""
https://teams.igem.org/555	Foundational Advance	Fluorescent proteins have become ubiquitous tools for studying cellular processes. To be particularly effective for these applications fluorescent proteins must feature fast maturation and degradation rates and these rates must be well-characterized and documented. The 2011 VT iGEM team has worked to find and characterize fluorescent proteins and degradation tags that more quickly degrade them. Here we present chemical and mathematical models based on two parameters maturation and degradation rates and in doing so we explored difficulties in the process of characterizing parts. In conducting our experimentation we tested fluorescent proteins with different degradation tags in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae using automated fluorescent microscopy techniques and then worked to determine a comprehensive accurate mathematical basis for fluorescent protein characterization.

The problems are reduction in land available for food production relatively low levels of CO2 biofixation and large biomass requirements. Our project aims to overcome these problems by utilizing E. coli for the production of biodiesel (C-12 fatty acids) and bioethanol. There have been a number of examples of biofuel production in E. coli; however 30-40% of production cost is based on media costs. Our project will surmount these high production costs by engineering the cyanobacteria Synechocystis PCC6803 to secrete large quantities of glucose that will feed our biofuel-producing E .coli. Cyanobacteria and E.coli will be co-cultivated to allow the mutual transfer of carbon to produce biofuels. This project provides an efficient means for producing biofuels without a carbon source.

Researchers found a vertical oxygen gradient establishes in the biofilm. Such property allows us to use oxygen sensitive promoters to artificially induce differentiated functions through the spatial distribution of cells. Thus, the multi-step reaction can be processed within the different layers of the biofilm.<BR><BR>The biofilm and its layered structure form spontaneously. Also biofilm has the natural resistance to high levels of toxin. These two properties render the Rainbofilm a convenient stable system for bio-production and bio-sensor. The system can cater to different needs simply by changing downstream genes. One possible application is ethanol production. The cellulose is degraded to monose from the bottom to the middle layer, and the ethanol is produced and secreted in the surface to minimize the toxicity to the inner cells.
https://teams.igem.org/562	Foundational Advance	Bacterial microcompartments are proteinaceous reaction chambers designed to 'cage in' metabolic pathways and increase efficiency. Potentially, these could be engineered to house any chemical reaction imaginable; to sequester toxic material; or to confer new physical properties to a host. Here, a synthetic microcompartment ('The Sphereactor') was designed and built. This was assisted by the creation of new mobile apps and web-based tools for DNA analysis. A synthetic operon was constructed, based on the pduABJKNTU genes from Salmonella, that assembled into the empty Sphereactor, which was also affinity-tagged to allow its isolation for downstream applications. A new targeting sequence comprising 20 residues of PduD was shown to target GFP into The Sphereactor. Attempts were made to pack the Sphereactor with many other proteins. Together, the Sphereactor and its new targeting sequence is a foundational advance that could influence the design of new metabolic pathways or inspire new bioremediation or biomedical projects.
https://teams.igem.org/563	WIKI	Although 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows' marks the termination of J. K. Rowling's popular novels, we recreate a fantastic world where patronus are produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae to fight against dementors inside the cell. Ethanol fermented by yeast from lignocellulosic materials can be an environmentally friendly fuel. However, rapid and efficient fermentation of lignocellulosic hydrolysates is limited because of inhibitors generated during pretreatment in addition to monomeric sugars. Inhibitors strongly affect the normal physiology of yeast as well as its ethanol productivity, just like the dementors taking away people's hope and happiness. Nevertheless, we reconstruct TOR protein, a central component of major signaling transduction network controlling cell growth, to increase the tolerance of yeast. A new TOR after directional mutation will play the role of patronus to defend the influence of inhibitors, keep the overall signaling networks in good order, and finally provide a prosperous world for ethanol production.

One such application could be the optimization and fine-tuning of synthetic biological circuits which is currently a cumbersome process of trial and error. We have investigated a novel type of RNA regulation where the inhibition caused by a small regulatory RNA is relieved by another RNA called trap-RNA. The system displays a large dynamic range and can uniquely target and repress any gene of interest providing unprecedented flexibility. We suspect that any level of repression is achievable by simply altering the sequences of the involved RNAs. Multiple such systems can coexist without interfering and are thus compatible with more complex designs. Furthermore the trap-RNA can be fused to any transcript in effect allowing any gene to act as an activator.""

In addition to being the primary cause of lung infections in cystic fibrosis patients many severe nosocomial infections can be attributed to P. aeruginosa. Currently the standard detection method requires a potential sample to be grown overnight and then screened for the pathogen of interest. Our goal is to create a faster detection method without sacrificing reliability or experimental resolution. To realize our objective we harnessed the native cell signaling and quorum sensing machinery of P. aeruginosa. Quorum sensing in P. aeruginosa is a complex hierarchy that governs the expression of numerous virulence genes.

https://teams.igem.org/597	Manufacturing	Cornell's 2011 iGEM team has designed a new scalable and cell-free method to produce complex biomolecules. Current methods for purification from cellular lysate are expensive and time consuming. Biofactory utilizes modified enzymes capable of being attached to surfaces in the creation of a modular microfluidic chip for each enzyme. The surface bonding is performed by the well characterized biotin-avidin mechanism. When combined in series these chips operate as a linear biochemical pathway for continous flow reactions. Additionally we engineered E. Coli with the mechanism for light-induced apoptosis to easily lyse cultures producing the necessary enzymes. The resulting lysate is flowed through the microfluidic channels coating them with the desired enzyme. We believe these methods will reduce unwanted side reactions and lower the costs of producing bio-pharmaceuticals in the future. ""

This is known as magnetotaxis and is achieved in these bacteria by creating uniformly shaped cubo-octahedral magnetite nanoparticles. Mms6 is a critical catalytic protein which binds to magnetite in order to facilitate the formation of an uniform crystal structure. Using the Mms6 gene from Magnetospirillium Magneticum AMB-1 we intend to create a magnetite synthesis pathway in E.Coli. Finally as a proof of concept we will also show how we can use the formation of magnetite as a novel gene expression system.

The need for low-cost portable and easy-to-use dosimeters became apparent as radiation measurements could only be conducted at sparsely-distributed installations and the values reported infrequently. We have decided to tackle the issue by building a biological dosimeter. Focus is placed on modularly transferring radiation response and DNA repair genes from the extremophilic bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans to the well-characterized easily cultivable chassis Escherichia coli. The native DNA damage detection and repair systems of E. coli will be also modified to efficiently sense ionizing radiation through detection of the resultant DNA damage. Finally detection will be connected to visible outputs such as color pigment production resulting in a biological device capable of detecting ionizing radiation and alerting users to it through color change.

The aim of our project is the production of biofuels, alkanes, using bacterial cells as factories. Alkanes, so called 'Green' hydrocarbon fuels, are chemically energetically the same as petroleum-based fuels, thus no penalty for use of conventional engines is encountered from their use. For alkane biosynthesis, we designed a synthetic circuit using bacterial bioluminescence system and aldehyde decarbonylase from Vibrio harveyi and cyanobacteria, respectively.

Infants in particular are susceptible to methemoglobinemia also known as 'blue baby syndrome' when formula is reconstituted using water contaminated with nitrates. By combining the red fluorescent protein coding region with a nitrate sensitive promoter we are developing an inexpensive simple visual test for nitrate contaminated water.

In poor availability of combined nitrogen, carnivorous E.coli emit light and attract bugs by using bioluciferase, then catch and digest them by mucilage and catabolic enzymes. To create carnivorous E.coli, we set up four sub-goals: hunger, luminescence, predation and digestion. In 'hunger', We measure activity of Ïƒ54 promoter with nitrogen regulatory protein, the activator. These promoter and protein enable E.coli to responce concentration of amino acids.

The system consists of two types of genetically modified E. coli: the random signal generating E. coli ('Brush E. coli') and the color generating E. coli ('Paint E. coli'). Brush E. coli possesses genes (lasI, luxI, rhlI, and cinI) in its gDNA that produce quorum molecules. On the other hand, by modified Cre-loxP mechanism, gDNA is randomly set to secrete only one of the four types of quorum molecules. Paint E.coli possesses plasmids that express one of four colors (red, cyan, yellow, and green) by producing fluorescent proteins in response to the type of quorum it receives from Brush E.coli. As Paint E.coli expresses corresponding fluorescence in response, it also produces quorum molecule that is identical to the inducer to start propagation. Ultimately, using this system, the 'random' contribution of cells will create art on an LB plate.

Acetaldehyde is a toxic and carcinogenic component of cigarette smoke. It has a boiling point of 20.2C and is very volatile, thus can be used as an information carrier through air.

The cells are engineered to sense acetaldehyde by a synthetically re-designed fungal acetaldehyde-responsive transactivator. The sensor is linked to a band-pass filter that drives GFP expression. This allows establishment of an input-concentration-dependent, spatially located fluorescent band displaying quantitative information about acetaldehyde.

https://teams.igem.org/644	Health & Medicine	Many microbial cells form biofilms as a means of survival. Biofilms are formed when a large number of microbial cells aggregate together. This year, the UCSF iGEM team has engineered artificial biofilms via yeast cell surface display. We synthetically engineered S. cerevisiae to form tunable biofilm-like structures by inducing the display of adhesive proteins on their surface. By combining the natural yeast mating receptors - Aga1 and Aga2 - with adhesive proteins from a variety of organisms, we created several adhesive interactions among yeast cells. Our synthetic cell adhesions can serve as a model for biofilm formation and primitive multicellular structures.

This year's ArtScienceBangalore project proposes alternate re-appropriations of the BioBrick by using existing BioBrick primers as random-PCR primers in investigating soil samples. This random PCR will provide a succinct signature of the biological diversity present in these samples. These investigations of soil lead us to ask questions about citizen's science 'performed' by non-institutional actors using accessible tools as well as gives us a glimpse into the 'post-natural world' where BioBricks may end up in our environment and may very well show up as bands in a gel. By imagining a world in which the Biobrick has become the accepted standard for synthetic biology, and where these engineered products are ubiquitous in our lives and environments, the samples we archive will serve as the baseline from which the subsequent extent of human influence can be measured.

These proteins have evolved in unique environments to sense light intensity in different colour ranges. This experiment focuses on constructing a biological switch that uses two photoreceptors from separate organisms -- Deinococcus radiodurans and Agrobacterium tumafaciens. The coupling of heme oxygenase supplies our photoreceptor proteins with biliverdin, allowing for the self-assembly of the switch within host systems. The switch is the first stage of a two component light sensor and when expressed at high level, there is a noticeable colour change of the cell when it is activated by light.

https://teams.igem.org/648	Environment	Ionizing radiation and radiation pollution is an important environmental problem that not only affects those working around radiation facilities, but those dealing with the aftermath of widespread nuclear disasters such as those at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear reactor. Penn State's team project designed and constructed a genetic circuit introduced into E. coli bacterial cells, in order to rapidly detect and report the presence of harmful ionizing radiation. We are working to create a robust and reliable biosensor that utilizes the lambda phage lytic-lysogenic switch as the radiation sensor. When the sensor detects radiation, it triggers one of three fast acting reporters we developed based on the concept developed by Imperial College's 2010 iGEM team. Each of the reporters features a different enzyme/substrate reaction (beta-galactosodise/beta-D-galactose, beta-glucurodinase/beta-D-glucuronide or C23O/catechol). We believe that the final construct may have the potential to rival current radiation detection methods, such as digital dosimeters.

Large scale (150mg/L) stable production of RiAFP and a RiAFP-GFP fusion protein was achieved in E. coli. Proteins were purified using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. E. coli expressing RiAFP exhibited increased survival post-freezing. RiAFP inhibited ice recrystallization in both splat and capillary assay.

Oil spills can pollute air and water and alter ecosystems for years. For this reason, last year's Panama team designed a BioBrick that can biosynthesize rhamnolipids under the presence of rhamnose and beta-hydroxyalkanoic acids. Rhamnolipids have emulsifying properties that reduces the surface tension of water, making the hydrocarbons easier to recover and biodegrade. This year we want to create a BioBrick that provides rhamnose for rhamnolipid biosynthesis and for other purposes as well. We also want to create a bioremediation system using existing biobricks that will produce the rhamnolipid while biodegrading the hydrocarbons in vivo. The system will be designed to operate with a lysis gene that will kill the cells once bioremediation of the contamination site is done.

A genetic circuit has been designed and characterized to establish a bacterial 'population-control' device in E. coli based on the well-known quorum-sensing system from Vibrio fischeri, which autonomously regulates the density of an E. coli population. The cell density is influenced by the expression levels of a killer gene (ccdB) in our device. We have successfully controlled the expression levels of ccdB by site-directed mutagenesis of a luxR promoter (lux pR) and error-prone PCR of gene luxR, and we are building a database for a series of mutation sites corresponding to different cell densities and fluorescent intensities.

It is a promising tool for engineering optical regulation of cellular behavior. Unlike most stimuli, light signals have the advantage of being highly precise with regards to temporal and spatial action as well as having readily tunable intensity. Within cells, a variety of effectors can be controlled using light, including DNA binding proteins, enzymes and mediators in signal transduction. Specifically, our projects focus on building light-responsive biobricks for control of mammalian cells by fusing photo-switchable domains found in plant, algal and fungal light sensing proteins to such effectors. Mammalian biochemistry is complex and well regulated, necessitating synthetic effectors that can be easily and dynamically adjusted to meet the needs of the application.

This practice often requires placing large enzymatic pathways into one cell. Production of the desired product is usually affected by increased metabolic burden or negative feedback on the cell. In nature, however, many organisms work symbiotically to accomplish a task and/or provide mutual benefits to one another. For the first part of our project, we have studied two systems to create cellular codependence in E. coli - using either pairs of auxotrophs or toxin/antitoxins.

Cells deficient in guanine biosynthesis and containing our refactored operon were addicted to caffeine; their growth density was limited by the availability of caffeine. Remarkably, they were able to sense the caffeine content of several common beverages. Characterization of nearby genes in the <i>P. putida</i> operon revealed a potential methylxanthine regulatory system for use in biological circuit design. The synthetic N-demethylation operon could be useful for cheaply producing pharmaceuticals or precursor molecules and for detoxifying waste so that it can be recycled into animal feed and biofuels.

To help solve the problem, we design a gene circuit which can both detect and defend against the phages. We use the modified promoter pRM to sense the phage’s infection and initiate the defence. The lysis gene which can make bacteria lyse is installed in our circuit. When it works, the phage won’t be able to take advantage of its host to replicate any longer. To win more time for lysis to function well, we design antisense RNA to prevent the phage from turning into lytic life cycle. Thus, when the lysis protein kills the host, the phage is still at lysogenic life cycle or the newly assembled phages are still immature. By using the quorum sensing system, the bacteria around the host will prepare to defend in advance. Attribute to these parts, our bacteria survive.

This project answers the question. We use reverse engineering techniques to get mathematical models such as ordinary differential equations(ODEs), directly from the experimental data and build the feasible designs according to the models. In this sense, we not only fully connect biology, experiments and mathematics, but also get feasible designs that have certain behaviors. To realize this idea, we build a suite of applications that provide researchers with efficient workflows.

Our team has taken advantage of the fine time control offered by the circadian clock machinery to construct a genetic circuit that allows robust oscillatory behavior in a synchronized and predictable manner. We have coupled the expression of genes of a bioluminescent pathway to the endogenous circadian clock of <i>Synechocystis PCC 6803</i>. The benefits of using <i>Synechocystis</i> as our chassis for practical applications include minimal production costs due to its autotrophic growth capacity and precise synchronization to time-dependent events using environmental cues such as light. As a direct application we designed the first self-rechargeable programmable bio-lamp. Secondary projects include a novel secretion system, the first spider-silk biobrick and an optimization of the Gibson assembly reaction for small parts.

https://teams.igem.org/747	Foundational Advance	Transactivator-Like Effectors (TALEs) are a brand-new technology that currently revolutionizes the way researchers manipulate DNA with exceptional site specificity. Originally derived from Xanthomonas spp., this type of protein comprizes an effector domain and a modular DNA binding domain that can be rationally designed to bind to virtually any target sequence of DNA. Over the past two years, universal endonucleases (TALENs) and transcription factors have been tested in various organisms ranging from bacteria to humans. According to existing protocols, TALE assembly requires several weeks of work and substantial lab skills. In order to bring this technology within reach for iGEM students, we invented an extremely fast and easy TALE assembly strategy and developed a TALE platform with expression plasmids and new classes of TALEs. With our so called GATE assembly kit, future iGEM students will be able to precisely manipulate genomic loci easier and faster than anyone else in the world.
https://teams.igem.org/748	Health & Medicine	<p>Staphylococcus aureus infections are major causes of morbidity and mortality in community and hospital settings. Since bacterial sensors are attracting more and more biologists' attention owing to its' specific, fast and accurate detecting, we plan to construct a E.coli biofilm consisting of two different engineered populations, which are designed to detect and eradicate S.aureus, respectively. The two engineered populations communicate with each other by AHL signal transduction. We hope that compartmentalization of functions can lessen metabolism load and cross-reactions interfere, and achieve the assembly of different functions in bacterial level. The whole system comprises sensing, killing and biofilm formation devices. </p> <p><b>Detecting device:</b> to detect the existence of S.aureus through sensing the AIPs secreted only from S.aureus.</p> <p><b>Killing device:</b> to eradicate S.aureus through the production and release of lysostaphin.</p> <p><b>Biofilm formation device:</b> to enhance biofilm formation by over-expression of yddV, a di-guanylate cyclase, which catalyzes GTP into c-di-GMP.</p>
https://teams.igem.org/749	Environment	Formaldehyde is a common harmful chemical, and it has a bad effect in relatively low concentration. (For example, in agricultural chemicals, in disinfectant at hospitals and in paint of building materials) Also, since formaldehyde is mass-produced in factories, it is highly possible to exceed over the permissible amount in the environment. This year, in Japan, the detection of formaldehyde in Tone river became an issue. (1) We planned to create E.coli with an ability to　detect and detoxify formaldehyde named Chef Ant E.coli. About detection, we try to visualize formaldehyde by ligating regulated promoter, frmR and GFP. Moreover we plan to overexpress two enzymes in Chef Ant E.coli. First, formaldehyde dehydrogenase decomposes formaldehyde to formic acid. The gene of formaldehyde dehydrogenase is from Pseudomonas Putida. Second, formic acid dehydrogenase converts formic acid to CO2 and H2O. The gene of formic acid dehydrogenase is from Methylbacterium extorquens.
https://teams.igem.org/750	New Application	We haved constructed a fluorescent digital display device with synthetic logic gates, which is able to respond to signals by displaying and switching numbers. We put GFP equipped with degradation tags in downstream to illuminate our numbers and change them quickly as well. Considering our engineering background, we accordingly employ cell immobilization to build our device. Engineering bacteria have been embedded in intra-hallow calcium alginate microcapsules and in PDMDAAC-NaCS microcapsules, respectively. In addition, 3D CAD design is performed for a perfect device. Our genetic circuits vary in length and RBS strength, leading to different durations of time delay for GFP expression. This inspired us to extend our work last year. By altering the strength of RBS at five grades, another five circuits have been built. After the induction by arabinose, the duration of response time for GFP expression increases as the strength of RBS declines, bringing about a time-course display.

https://teams.igem.org/753	New Application	The goal of this project was to construct a biosensor for the hCG hormone consisting of S. cerevisiae. The human luteinizing hormone receptor (LH/CG), a GPCR with high affinity for hCG, was therefore expressed in yeast. The yeast strain used contains a yeast/human chimeric Gα-subunit, enabling coupling of the LH/CG-receptor with the pheromone pathway in yeast. Binding of hCG should consequently result in activation of the pathway. The genes tnaA and fmo, encoding tryptophanase and flavin-containing monooxygenase respectively, were introduced into the yeast strain. These enzymes catalyze the conversion of tryptophan to indigo. tnaA was set under the control of the pheromone induced FIG1 promoter and fmo was expressed constitutively. Hence, detection of hCG should result in the production of bio-indigo, the output signal of the biosensor. In order to ensure hCG to pass the cell wall, the gene CWP2, encoding a cell wall mannoprotein, was deleted.
https://teams.igem.org/754	Food & Energy	We present an artificial consortium between 2 specialized bacteria by the means of genetic engineering, in order to obtain a photosynthetically fed biolamp. It is a novel proposal of synthetic ecology, based on the use of an efficient photosynthesizer (the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus) modified to become an exporter of sucrose and diel switch of the activity of Aliivibrio fischeri, a marine bacterium widely known for its bioluminescent properties in response to quorum sensing signals. Our modified cyanobacteria feed the population of A. fischeri through a transporter protein and produce AHL to induce bioluminescence in response to the activity of a photosensitive operator, which would activate only at night. We also have tried to transform different microalgae with bioluminescence genes to test their effectiveness. We look forward to develop an efficient and autosufficient environmentally friendly biolamp, with potential application to cover the illumination needs of many infrastructure sectors.
https://teams.igem.org/755	WIKI	The GSU iGEM Team strives to modify shuttle vectors for the expression of proteins in Pichia pastoris and within recombinant plants. Adapting the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (pGAP) shuttle vector to iGEM standards enables the expression of complex proteins in Pichia pastoris, due to post-translational modifications and a secretion system. We also plan to standardize the pPic9 shuttle vector for the same purposes. Our second project involves the use of Agrobacterium tumefaciens, the causative agent of Crown-Gall disease in plants. The ability of this organism's Ti plasmid to insert foreign DNA into a plant’s chromosome is used to manipulate plants to express desired traits. These small plasmids house a cloning site and a selectable marker between the left and right border of the TDNA. The aim of this project is to modify a binary vector system to be compatible with the iGEM standard for the expression of foreign proteins within plants.
https://teams.igem.org/758	Health & Medicine	Drosophila melanogaster has been used for a genetic study as model organism for a long time and brought us much discovery. And we are sure that the benefit continues from now on. Therefore we KIT-Kyoto team aim at the production of the disease model Drosophila which expresses the responsible gene of MALT lymphoma that is one of leukemia. It is thought that we can contribute to elucidation of the mechanism of this disease and the development of the therapeutic drug by promoting this project. In addition, we think about what we can do in order to continue researches using Drosophila melanogaster in the world. So, this year we aim at the design of the parts with which a study that we use the Drosophila can expand in iGEM in future. If these projects are realized, the study using D. melanogaster will step forward to the new one step again.
https://teams.igem.org/759	Village	We designed two modules to make “Bio-capsule E. coli that accumulatesbio-plastic. First module is to form bio-capsule by aggregation using cell-cell interactive protein “Ag43” located on the surface of E. coli. Aggregate of E. coli enables collecting them by simple filtration so production of valuable materials will be more efficient. Second module is to produce bio-plastic (poly-3-hydroxybutyrate P3HB). Development of cost-efficient method to manufacture biodegradable plastic is one of the most important issues for making sustainable future society. We optimized culture conditions for more efficient production of “Bio-capsule E. coli” and P3HB. This is the first successful production of bio-plastic as an iGEM team. We will try to extend the applicability of this system for producing other high-value macromolecules in the capsule. Also we created new Bio-Communication tool named "Biobrick Reviews and Issues" to share iGEMer's opinions about each biobrick.

https://teams.igem.org/762	Food & Energy	<p>In synthetic biology, a powerful method for the production of novel metabolites is the expression of heterologous genes in <i>Escherichia coli.</i> A common challenge when using non-native genes in metabolic engineering is determining if they are being properly expressed. To address this issue, we have constructed a BioFusion compatible system for testing the translation of a gene of interest. This system couples the translation of the target gene to a fluorescent reporter gene. Fluorescence will only be detected when the target gene is entirely translated. This construct enables synthetic biologists to quickly determine if a gene is being expressed without the need for costly antibodies or analytical instruments (e.g. mass spectrometry). Currently, we are utilizing this cassette to troubleshoot the expression of limonene synthase, an enzyme that catalyzes the production of limonene, a monoterpene with potential as a renewable jet fuel.</p>
https://teams.igem.org/763	Village	Do you speak to your bacteria? We do. We have designed, constructed and characterized an inter-specific translator based on light pulses that allows to literally dialogue with microorganisms. We have built seven biobricks with fluorescent proteins under the control of environmentally-sensitive promoters. The process is as follows: human voice messages are electronically- and then light-encoded in excitation wavelengths, and microbial proteins’ emission wavelengths are electronically- and voice-encoded back. We have used this system to find out the fermentative status of budding yeast and to dialogue with E. coli allowing it to answer questions such as “are you hungry?” The three pillars of our project (human practices, modeling and wetlab) yielded continuous feedback with each other, illustrating an integrated interdisciplinary approach. For example, in human practices, we qualitatively analysed the risk of cheater mutants (“liers”), which was quantitatively supported by our results in both our modeling simulations and in the wetlab.
https://teams.igem.org/764	Manufacturing	Polysaccharides have a spectacular range of properties and uses, from the structural and medicinal, to foods and glues. These properties stem from the relationships between the chemical nature of the sugars, their arrangement within the polymer and the arrangement of the polymer itself. Scientists rely on chemical modification of polysaccharides or expensive and time-consuming production via synthetic chemistry to understand these relationships. This project, e-candi, asks if synthetic biology could generate designer polysaccharides. We created biobricks for the biosynthesis of useful polysaccharides in Escherichia coli and asked whether we could synthesise a novel polymer sequence in E. coli by targeting endogenous polysaccharide biosynthesis. We developed this work further through the generation of a GTase database with a user-friendly interface to aid polymer construction, and by investigating a GTase donor/acceptor characterization assay alongside mathematical modeling of our biosynthetic system in order to improve system understanding and performance.

In prokaryotes, information transmission through slow diffusion of chemical compounds is limited either in width or rate. In our project, we constructed a bio-film like Domino E.coli community, aimed at achieving an expansive and rapid biological signal processing system. Domino E.coli community, as its name suggests, is capable of amplifying a weak starting signal via geometrical progression, taking advantage of quorum sensing effect. Meanwhile, our system undergoes multi-signal integration, logical computation and transformation of chemical inputs to visual outputs, suggesting the approach of constructing multi-cellular biocomputing.

https://teams.igem.org/769	New Application	We created an <i>E. coli</i> for long distance communication. This “<i>Communicheria coli</I>” was inspired by the Pony Express, a rapid mail delivery service in the American Wild West, where mail was relayed by horseback riders. <i>Communicheria coli</I> sends a message, in the form of light, to distant cells, which then relay the message to other distant cells. <i>Communicheria coli</I> has light sensors constructed using the light receptor domain of bacterial sensory rhodopsin or the cyanobacterial green light sensor CcaS. In response to light signals, cells will induce their own lux operon to send the message to other distant cells, for example in a separate flask, which will in turn relay the message to other distant cells. To improve the effectiveness of our new signal delivery system, we set out to enhance the light intensity, change the light color, and shorten the response time.
https://teams.igem.org/770	Environment	Our overall objective is to create cyanobacteria that glow exclusively in darkness. To accomplish this, we will use a native promoter (lrtA) that normally functions as a light-regulated promoter in cyanobacteria. We will insert it into a plasmid together with the luxCDABE cassette. The cassette contains the luciferase enzyme and enzymes necessary for regeneration of its substrates. The final goal is to make cyanobacteria (Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7002) glow because cyanobacteria perform photosynthesis and therefore do not need supplied nutrients. First, the experiment is carried out in E. coli and afterwards the plasmid is transferred to the cyanobacteria. Both of the systems will subsequently be thoroughly analyzed to determine important characteristics of the system including kinetics and efficiency of the expression levels. To achieve this quantification we will collaborate with a fellow Physics student at University of Copenhagen.
https://teams.igem.org/771	New Application	In this year’s project, we aim at constructing a set of protein systems on the E.coli cell membrane as carriers of enzymes of assorted reactions. Distinct from linear DNA or RNA scaffolds in the traditional sense, the membrane protein system expands the dimension of reaction space, making possible the framework of numerous complex reactions on the two-dimensional plane, for example, switchable or circular reactions. In such a device, the membrane replaces DNA or RNA scaffolds as an extensive surface for proteins to anchor without limitation of expression amount. More importantly, by gathering the downstream enzymes through signal regulation, the reaction can be accelerated sharply. Besides, products can be transported much more efficiently from the inside to the outside of the cell in that the enzymes are tied to the membrane proteins. Hence the membrane is where the magic happens.
https://teams.igem.org/772	WIKI	Our project is mainly based on the early diagnosis of cancer. EpCAM (Epithelial cell adhesion molecule) is a pan-epithelial differentiation antigen overexpressed on the basolateral surface of most carcinomas and Circulating Tumor Cells(CTC); the cells which are released into blood in early phases of cancer. Our objective is to fix appropriate antibodies for EpCAM antigens to the E.coli cell wall so that we will be able to detect CTCs before the cancer precipitates its way to metastasis. For the next step, we plan to enhance the detection signal in our bacteria by the means of quorum sensing mechanism. Finally, to prevent the production of possible undesirable and detrimental genetically modified organisms (GMOs), we aim to induce self-destruction device in our E.coli via emission of light.

From pond water, we isolated bacteria capable of metabolizing lignin and polystyrene. We attempted to identify the degradation genes and express them in Escherichia coli. In parallel, we worked to optimize ethanol production in E. coli by diverting electron flow from normal cell metabolism to alcohol fermentation. We also explored using Zymomonas mobilis, a more efficient ethanol producer, as an expression host for our biodegradation enzymes. <p></p> We also aimed to improve the spatial and temporal control of bacterial behavior. We modified the coliroid system to produce a degradable output, allowing a bacterial image to change over time. With this animated coliroid, we worked to create an interface between digital animation and biology using a simple light projector.
https://teams.igem.org/774	New Application	Imagine a world in which all sectors of industry use synthetic biology to meet specific needs. The NRP-UEA team have developed novel biobricks, which provide a foundation for a system with this level of complexity. The project began with a simple idea with widespread applications: the detection of exogenous nitric oxide (NO). However it soon became clear the detection of highly reactive NO was challenging, and this was addressed in two main ways. A bacterial promoter, PyeaR, was fused to its mammalian counterpart, CArG. The functionality of this flexible dual promoter was determined in both mammalian and bacterial chassis. Yet it was determined that further specificity was still needed, leading to the comparator circuit, that subtracts the expression of one promoter from that of another, allowing for signal integration and quantitative computing. This system thus allows for the detection of any chemical, providing the promoters have overlapping specificity.

https://teams.igem.org/776	Foundational Advance	The metabolic versatility of purple non-sulfur photosynthetic bacteria allows them to grow in light, darkness and with or without oxygen; all it is due to their genetic regulation mechanisms. Taking advantage of this, our project aims to build two genetic control systems based on R. sphaeroides photosynthesis cluster regulation. The first one is a light dependent system controlled by two proteins AppA/PpsR that works like an antirepresor/repressor mechanism, and the second one is an oxygen dependent system of two-component called PrrA/PrrB. This two devices were tested on R. palustris chassis, using a cassete in which a reporter (GFP) is regulated by external conditions that activate or repress its expresion. Once we have characterized the functionality of these networks, our perspective is to develop a Rhodofactory, it means to control the produccion of differents metabolites, such as biodiesel and butanol, using simple signals.
https://teams.igem.org/777	Health & Medicine	The model organism <i>Escherichia coli</i> is naturally capable of sensing substances in its environment and consequently moves directionally towards these, a phenomenon known as chemotaxis. Here, we apply directed evolution to chemoreceptors by targeting five amino acid residues in the ligand binding site to enable <i>E. coli</i> to perceive novel substances. In order to investigate mobility and directed movement towards a substance, an effective mobility selection method using special “swimming plates” is designed. Additionally, we attempt to improve <i>E. coli</i>’s swimming velocity by creating new parts derived from its own motility apparatus. Based on our selection system, we identify variants of chemoreceptors with new binding specificities in the mutant library. By these means, we aim to train the bacterium to detect new molecules such as tumor cell markers. Once having established <i>E. coli</i> as our “tracking dogs”, the possible applications in medicine but also to environmental issues are virtually countless.
https://teams.igem.org/778	Food & Energy	Today, large quantities of food and drinks, together with the enormous amounts of energy they contain, are dumped without being reused. However, the moisture in this waste prevents it from being used as a energy source by burning. Our project aims to reuse such nutritious garbage by Escherichia coli digesting glucose to synthesize hydrogen, which is expected to be used in various useful ways, such as in fuel cells. E. coli cells have intrinsic metabolic systems related to synthesis of hydrogen from glucose via formic acid. We are trying to improve the latter part of this metabolic system, the formic acid-hydrogen pathway, by overexpressing a gene which controls a step in this pathway. If we are successful, what we have to do for getting energy is to share our sweets and juices with E. coli.
https://teams.igem.org/779	Information Processing	The complexity of engineered genetic circuits in eukaryotic systems is limited by the availability of regulatory components and further hampered by the inability to assemble and deliver large DNA constructs. In contrast, <i>in vitro</i> synthetic DNA circuits utilizing strand displacement have demonstrated complex digital logic with reliable and scalable behaviors in a small base-pair footprint. The possible adaption of such circuits into cellular environments can amplify the scale and complexity of biological circuits, broadening synthetic biology’s application space. Our project leverages strand displacement to create a process technology that supports multi-input sensing, sophisticated information processing, and precisely-regulated actuation in mammalian cells. We construct RNA strand displacement circuits that detect endogenous mRNA, perform digital logic computation, and output desired proteins through programmable RNA interference pathways. We envision <i>in-vivo</i> RNA strand displacement as a new foundation for scaling up complexity in engineered biological systems, with applications in biosynthesis, biomedical diagnostics and therapeutics.
https://teams.igem.org/780	Foundational Advance	The iGEM community is far focused on <i>Escherichia coli</i> as the model organism, and a vast majority of available BioBricks is designed to work in this chassis. We would like to encourage working with another important bacteria, Gram-positive <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>, thus our project aims at obtaining new parts dedicated to this micro-organism. We also design a mammalian BioBrick that opens a new pathway into 'bricking' eucaryotic cells. Our idea is to construct a system enabling us to achieve expression of gene of choice inside a mammalian cell. This system consists of two parts: a shuttle vector, working both in <i>B. subtilis</i> and in eucaryotic cells, and an invasive strain of <i>B. subtilis</i>. Invasiveness would be achieved by expression of listeriolysin.
https://teams.igem.org/781	Village	This year, Queen’s iGEM team is using flagella to host heterologous proteins that will result in thousands of useful enzymes organized in an extensive scaffold, with the benefits of extracellular synthesis, degradation and arrangement. The fliC (flagellin) protein is known to spontaneously polymerizes to form the length of flagella in E.coli. By replacing the variable D3 domain of the fliC protein with proteins for binding, degradation, adhesion, and synthesis, we can increase the efficiency of bioremediation and biosynthesis, and facilitate the collection of products <i>in situ</i> or <i>ex situ</i>. This year we will also introduce dance as a presentation form and part of our human practices project. Known as SynthetiQ, we will be the first group ever to use dance to replace powerpoint slides at a research conference.
https://teams.igem.org/782	Health & Medicine	Currently, biological drug-based therapies require periodic invasive application. Often, due to their systemic administration, adverse effects are observed. Furthermore, large quantities of these substances are needed because of their distribution throughout the body. This, coupled with expensive production and especially purification, imposes a great burden on health systems. We aim to develop a safe and cost-effective biological delivery system for biopharmaceuticals, which would increase the quality of patients' lives, because it would minimize the number of required procedures. This type of delivery system would increase patient compliance to the therapy while the local administration will reduce the side-effects associated with current treatments. We plan to design the mammalian cells-based delivery system to be regulated by the digital logic from the outside.
https://teams.igem.org/783	Information Processing	Our project aims to introduce a standardized protocol for the characterization of genetic circuits using flow cytometry. We built a vast number of both simple and complex genetic circuits that were characterized using flow cytometry. These genetic circuits were built using an assembly technique called MoClo (developed by Weber et al., 2011), which involves a multi-way, one-pot digestion-ligation reaction, enabling faster and more efficient construction of genetic circuits. We converted a large subset of BioBrick™ Parts from the Registry (http://partsregistry.org/) into MoClo Parts using PCR and cloning strategies. We built and characterized various genetic circuits using MoClo Parts and compared them against their pre-existing BioBrick™ counterparts in order to compare the characterization results from the two assembly techniques. We also created a standardized data sheet to be included in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts for each Part we characterized to easily share our data with the synthetic biology community.

Because of their highly specific infection ability, they can be used as vessels for smart" therapeutic strategies which rely on an agent that can effectively analyze the cellular environment and compute an appropriate response. To demonstrate the potential of a "smart" strategy we are developing a "Trojan Horse" type of approach based on bactriophage-lambda.<br> Our project uses phage lambda and its target organism E.coli as a proof of concept for creating a system with predefined actions that demonstrates the described strategy. The design is based on a high specificity system which combines several different cell elements that will function as a type of logic AND gate. The phage will not harm the bacteria unless three independent conditions are met activating the phage's lytic cycle and resulting in the bacteria's death; imitating a "Trojan Horse".
https://teams.igem.org/785	Information Processing	Using light as messager is rarely seen in the biological system. In project BIOWAVE, we want to create such a light driven feedback system including artificial light sensor and bioiluminescence. With the properties of feedback system and time-lapse of gene expression,colony could form a detectable wave like pattern in a macroscopic level. Project Nano-tubular Highways is about constructing a brand-new biological model using a recently discovered cellular structure termed Tunneling Nanotubes(TNT) and bacteria with green fluorescence protein. Studying the distribution of the bacteria which could transport through the TNT and its pattern format is helpful for the optimal model problem. Project LabCloud aims to provide a mobile app for iGEMers share their experiments, ideas, files and others in and between teams. It will also provide group's shared calendar, instruments management and other powerful functions to help iGEMers’ cooperation. At last, it has the Push Notification to ensure communication in time.
https://teams.igem.org/786	Foundational Advance	Although the sensory technology has been deeply explored and implemented in various means, most of the developed sensors are chemically-dependent promoters which regulate downstream gene expression. We exploited the use of halobacterial sensors, the sensory rhodopsins which are sensitive to a wide spectrum of readily available light source and build a series of sensing systems to control cellular movement and gene regulation. This system can be executed as a fundamental part for further applications, such as cell targeting and refining. Furthermore, to counter the safety issues caused by the leakage of bioengineered cells, this sensing method altogether with the CRISPR/Cas sytem can targart and achieve the cleavage of the transformed plasmid under the stimulation of natural light sources.
https://teams.igem.org/787	Food & Energy	The current fossil fuel-dependent economy drives a demand for sustainable energy resources. Although much effort has gone into the production of ethanol, other biofuels, such as butanol, are superior. Butanol has a higher energy content, is less volatile, and is safer to use than ethanol. To develop strains of bacteria that produce high levels of 1-butanol we have introduced the genes coding for a biochemical pathway from Clostridium acetobutylicum into a mutant E. coli strain that produces a high level of NADH. The combination of these chemical pathways is predicted to increase the level of butanol production. Our second project, the Bacterial Etch-a-Sketch, features a complex network of gene expression and repression that enables a lawn of bacteria to respond to 470nm light. This task presents many engineering challenges: the bacteria need to be sensitive enough to respond to a laser pulse, yet selective enough to use in ambient lighting.
https://teams.igem.org/788	Health & Medicine	Exogenous RNAs are flowing and working in our body, and food carries them besides traditional nutrients. Evidence shows that natural plant miRNAs can be ingested into mammal bodies and target specific genes. Such discoveries show us a promising approach to perform cross-kingdom information transpotation and gene regulation. We propose a method of controlling animal gene expression and helping cure disease by creating vegetable that produces artificial siRNAs targeting critical genes for some disease. This time, we chosed PGC-1 alpha gene, which is over-expressed in fatty liver and contributes to insulin resistance, as the target. This concept can provide us a better perception of our daily diet and a new way of curing disease. On the other hand, we expand the boarder of iGEM by working on green plant. Firstly standardized binary vector is constructed. Also, we designed a brand divece for transgenic plant to help solving potential safety problems.
https://teams.igem.org/789	Foundational Advance	In digital electronics, a buffer amplifier is used to filter noise, isolate parts of a circuit, and make low signals lower/high signals higher. The ability to make many orthogonal buffer amps is critical to scaling up digital information processing in vivo. For our project, we first provide two mathematical proofs: (1) the buffer amp is equivalent" to a bistable circuit in that the ability to create one implies the ability to create the other and (2) inhibitors with first-order binding cannot allow bistability (without other elements). This means that methods such as TALORs and many sRNA strategies cannot build a buffer amp. Thus we test a new method: sequence-specific formation of a DNA-DNA-RNA triple helix to block a promoter. By using a dimer for the RNA we can achieve second-order binding allowing us to build sequence-specific buffer amps."
https://teams.igem.org/790	WIKI	Continuing from last year, the Waterloo iGEM team has repeated the project in the hopes to finalize the project. Introns, self-excising ribozymes, can become a useful tool to create in vivo protein fusions of BioBrick parts. To make this possible, intron sequences are used to flank non-protein parts embedded in coding sequences. An intron sequence with an embedded recombination site is capable of in vivo insertion of a compatible protein fusion part. As an example, a GFP-fusion was created with an intervening lox site that is removed from the final protein using the intron to form a fully functional GFP protein.

Our primary goal therefore is to aid these beginners get used to iGEM earlier to make project initiation swift. All of our tools are web-based and have user-friendly interfaces enabling users to gain quick access to needed information. Our project consists of the following four tools. <br> <br> <b>“BioBrick Search”</b> improves convenience in searching BioBrick parts by a sophisticated interface and an ordering algorithm taking into acount the parts' frequency of use. With <b>“Past Project Search”</b>, you can run a keyword search for all past projects and access past teams' presentation material easily. <b>“BioBrick Puzzle”</b> and <b>“Gene Network Game”</b> are educational games intended for beginners to acquire knowledge about BioBricks and gene networks, which aides them to plan their projects and conduct experiments.
https://teams.igem.org/792	Foundational Advance	We aimed to create a stable community of microorganisms that could be used as a standard tool. Our system would allow the co-culture of several genetically engineered machines in tunable proportions. Hence the engineered organism would be a standard part! This defines a new level of modularity allowing the increase of the complexity of the system by moving to the community level. We´ve come up with several plausible circuits designs and in silico predictions and decided to build a “crossfeeding” system in which each strain produces and secretes an aminoacid the other strains need to grow. We characterized two auxotrophic yeast strains (for tryptophan and histidine) and designed novel biobricks that regulate the export of Trp and His rich peptides. In the future this would allow for other modules to control the proportions of each strain, thus allowing dynamic and stimulus dependent changes in the abundances of each strain.

https://teams.igem.org/797	New Application	A flower fairy had been merely a creature of imagination until October 5 2012, but not more. Our Flower Fairy E.coli are capable of blooming flowers on demand by producing FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) protein, called Florigen, a kind of plant hormone composed of 175 amino acids. To make it possible for FT protein to access to plant cells directly from E.coli, we established a new protein translocation system, R-TAT. Our R-TAT system can carry proteins from the cytoplasm to plant cells while maintaining appropriate folding of target proteins.　We will show that FT protein induces expression of genes involved in anthesis and functions effectively at low doses by confirming that FT protein activates some key blooming-related genes such as AP1.　We will also provide iGEMers incredible promoters constructed through Golden Gate Assembly. Our Giant Controllable-Promoter, for example, is composed of 5x promoter regions following a Lac repressor element.
https://teams.igem.org/798	New Application	For this year's iGEM competition we create a programmable time switch in yeast(Saccharomyces cerevisiae) employing the counting mechanism of telomere. The time switch we made counts the replication number of a single yeast cell, and triggers the activation of a certain gene (death gene, for example) when the replication number of the cell reaches the pre-set level. The work is an attempt to use the special quality of telomere and the end of chromosomes in the construction of synthetic biology device. Our system utilizes a whole new mechanism that is seldom used in cell counting device, and it enables us to delay the expression of a certain gene for generations. By control the life span of a certain cell, it sheds new light on the biosafety concerns and can be used for fields such as the protection of intellectual property rights.
https://teams.igem.org/799	Manufacturing	Our global community deserves access to healthcare and nutrition currently available to only the most fortunate among us. Thanks to synthetic biology applications exploiting the yeast chassis, valuable compounds such as anti-malarial drugs and specialty chemicals can now be produced inexpensively. Using Golden Gate assembly designed for BioBrick compatibility, we have developed two tools to improve yeast expression of non-native pathways. First, we engineered an ethanol control system that reduces yeast's endogenous stress response and diverts more cellular resources towards product synthesis. Second, we constructed a light-induced system for instantaneous gain- and loss-of-function at the protein level. These tools will allow engineers to optimize heterologous pathways by monitoring toxic intermediates or regulating flux in a controllable, time-dependent manner. We hope our ideas will shape the future of industrial cell-based manufacturing.
https://teams.igem.org/800	Village	Autogene is an innovative CAD tool used to automate the design process of synthetic DNA sequences. The first module, AutoPlasmid, leverages the power of cloud computing, sophisticated bioinformatics algorithms, and an expert curated feature database containing over 40,000 features to automatically annotate natural/synthetic DNA sequences, finding both perfect and imperfect matches. It also provides an effective solution to the Registry of Parts for annotation automation and pathogen sequence detection. The second module, AutoDesign, provides users with a drag-and-drop design environment to construct new sequences using user-imported features as well as those from our database. The third module AutoFab, which is still being developed, will provide users with guidelines of fabricating and optimizing their synthetic DNA. Compatible with other common bioinformatics tools such as ApE and capable of documenting in SBOL, genbank, and fasta formats, we hope that Autogene will allow synthetic biologists to take their research to the next level.

https://teams.igem.org/802	Food & Energy	Biofilms are responsible for billions of dollars in production losses and treatment costs in the industry every year. Biofilm-related problems are major concerns in the food industry where it can cause food spoilage or poisoning, in health industry because of pathogens' persistence and dispersal, or in the oil and water industry where it causes corrosion. Assuming that the environment is already over-saturated with harmful chemicals such as biocides, whose long term health effects remains to be elucidated, there is a great need for innovating solutions to reduce detrimental biofilm effects. To reduce the use of biocides, the INSA-Lyon iGEM team aims to engineer a bacterial torpedo" capable to infiltrate and destroy biofilms formed on industrial equipments pipes or reservoirs. Industrial surfaces will then be protected from further deleterious contamination by either a surfactant coating or the establishment of a protective biofilm produced by the torpedo bacteria."
https://teams.igem.org/803	Environment	Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are widespread, cancer-causing pollutants left-over mainly from manufacture of capacitors and electric motors. There are over 200 possible PCBs, derivatives of biphenyl, which share the same biodegradation pathways in bacteria. Our team is using a genetic engineering approach to produce a small consortium of E. coli that should efficiently degrade biphenyl, and it is hoped that this same system can be adapted for the bioremediation of PCBs. Natural bioremediation by native bacterial communities is exceedingly slow due to the recalcitrant nature of PCBs and their hydrophobic properties which reduce the bioavailability to potential catabolizers. We are taking a three-pronged approach in an attempt to increase the efficiency of biphenyl bioremediation—attraction of biphenyl-degrading E. coli by other guiding bacteria, overexpression of the biphenyl catabolic enzymes, and production of a biosurfactant to increase the solubility of biphenyl. Together, this system should significantly increase the rate of biphenyl degradation.
https://teams.igem.org/804	Village	The field of synthetic biology has seen the development of many biological monocultures capable of performing a wide range of novel functions. In contrast to this current paradigm, microbes have naturally evolved to survive as members of dynamic communities with distributed metabolism. This “divide and conquer” strategy allows the community to perform more complicated metabolic processing than would be possible in single microorganisms while being resilient to environmental changes. Despite very recent proof of concepts in developing model microbial consortia, or synthetic ecology, questions remain as to whether complex metabolic pathways can be engineered in context of microbial populations. The 2012 University of British Columbia iGEM team sets a precedent by engineering a tunable consortium with a distributed 4S desulfurization pathway for increased efficiency in the removal of organosulfurs in heavy oils and bitumen resources.

In order to mitigate energy crisis, the HUST-China team has designed two systems to produce power sources. <br><b>Lignocellulose Decomposer:</b> We constructed three strains of Pichia pastoris that pretreat lignocellulose, an important biomass resource, degrade cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, the three polymers of lignocellulose, and finally generate ethanol. We introduced several genes and used external secretion and cell surface co-display techniques to express the corresponding enzymes. <br><b>Microbial Fuel Cell: </b>Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC) can generate electricity using glucose, acetate or lactate, especially when the substrate is simple organic. Our project would firstly construct a signal regulated network to control the formation or depolymerization of biofilm. And then we will build a metabolic pathway to decomposition pyruvate into CO2, so that the NADH can be consumed and regenerated for electric energy export.
https://teams.igem.org/806	New Application	In a specific system composed of two kinds of homologous cells, the cells with higher growth rate could gain the upper hand in numbers and then replace the slower ones. This process will cause the system unstable. But a stable and proper ratio of numbers of the two cells is essential for an efficient system like stem cells and the mature ones. So we are constructing a model of an asymmetric cell differentiation to maintain a stable system. We want to construct a system where the cells with higher growth rate could transform into the slower ones which has a different function. And with this process the system would become efficient and stable. We are constructing the part of regulation with toggle switch and Gene A, which is supposed to slow down the cycle of divisions when transfected successfully, to accomplish an automatic asymmetric cell differentiation.

The goal of the uOttawa team this year was to tackle this problem by characterizing parts and improving gene assembly by taking advantage of <i>S. Cerevisiae’s</i> ability to exist in both the haploid and diploid form. Inducible systems were used to externally manipulate gene expression and allowed for a fine-tuning of the designed networks. A shuttle vector was designed that will take advantage of the assembly abilities of yeast and the replicative abilities of bacteria. To expand the Biobrick registry we will be submitting new inducible activators, promoters and our shuttle vector.
https://teams.igem.org/808	Environment	Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) has become the most widely manufactured synthetic polymer. With annual production exceeding 100 million tons (2010), it creates an issue of PET waste. In Western countries less than 70% of PET production is recovered by recycling. Biological processes play no role so far, only expensive chemical processes are applicable yet. PET waste left to erosion in the environment creates nanoparticles which tend to accumulate toxic substances. This poses a growing environmental threat and a serious health risk. Thus, developing new methods for PET degradation has become an urgent issue. Team TUD designed a bacterial recycling system that uses PET waste as a resource for synthesis of new chemical compounds. The proposed solution pursues PET decomposition into its monomers, transportation into E. coli and leading via terephthalic acid (TPA) to a high-value end product. The latter’s specification is determined by the inserted enzymes to build new metabolic pathways.

However, these man-made pathways incorporated in cytoplasm may suffer inferences from the original genes and pathways within the cell. Eukaryotic cells have organells that separate important pathways from that in the cytoplasm. Thus we want to make our own organells that perform the designed function. There has been some works on man-made organells, however this year the team of Shenzhen plan to create our man-made organell and apply it to organic synthesis by engineering yeast mitochondria, which we call Yeast Artificial Organell, and YAO for short.
https://teams.igem.org/810	Foundational Advance	Traditional plasmid-based cloning methods are limited by tedious protocols that make targeted genetic changes within the cell. Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering (MAGE), an alternative technique for rapidly generating genomic diversity using the recombination ability of the λ-phage ssDNA-binding protein β, has to date only been introduced in <i>E. coli.</i> These cells must be transformed via electroporation for each MAGE cycle to facilitate efficient uptake of mutagenic oligonucleotides, but this process kills a significant portion of otherwise viable cells. For our project, we designed and created a universal test cassette system to introduce MAGE to diverse bacteria as well as a library of β homologs for testing. Finally, we optimized the technique for the naturally competent organisms <i>B. subtilis</i> and <i>A. baylyi</i> to eliminate the costly electroporation step and developed computational algorithms to aid in the design and prediction of MAGE experiments.

Upon binding to HER2 overexpressing cells, bacterial cytotoxicity can be triggered with spatial and temporal precision by illumination with blue light, which activates overexpression and secretion of Cytolysin A (ClyA) under the control of the pDawn transcriptional module. Furthermore, we are also investigating the feasibility of engineering bacterial biofilms that can act as antimicrobial surfaces. We are engineering E. coli bacteria to form non-pathogenic biofilms that express bacteriolytic proteins capable of inhibiting the formation of pathogenic biofilms that are potential sources of hospital acquired infections. These cells carry the a gene encoding lysostaphin (lss), which selectively destroys the cell walls of Streptococcus bacteria, a common pathogen in many hospital settings.
https://teams.igem.org/812	Foundational Advance	Building on a long-standing French fascination for frogs, we wanted to spread this enthusiasm to the world of synthetic biology by introducing a new, vertebrate chassis to the community: Xenopus tropicalis. This leap towards multicellular biological engineering required new tools, so we first developed a new set of frog compatible vectors, biobricked tissue specific promoters and a new technique to assemble them in a single shot. To benefit from tissue compartmentalisation, we created a synthetic, orthogonal hormonal system using the plant molecule auxin. We also investigated E. coli/Xenopus interfacing, effectively creating a synthetic ecosystem. We modelled our system at the organism scale, using a multi-level and multi-technique approach. Finally, working with whole animals during iGEM brought a load of difficult ethical questions regarding animal biotechnologies and experimentation. This led us to wonder: Are we a chassis?

Rather than depending upon slow and expensive chemical synthesis, our team has developed two cohesive platforms utilizing the BioBrick strategy and synthetic biology to produce compounds for public health and nutrition using industrially-relevant microorganisms. First, we constructed and optimized designer pathways, using the BioBrick platform, for the production of a suite of sunscreen-like compounds that inhibit the effects of ultraviolet radiation, which we hope to incorporate into bacteria found on the skin microbiome for prolong ultraviolet protection. We also developed a novel and modular BioBrick backbone for expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. For demonstration, we constructed a caffeine production pathway in this backbone, generating a yeast strain which produces caffeine. Both of these projects gain impact from their synergistic application of synthetic biology and bioengineering for products that apply to real-world situations for researchers and the general public.

Our team created a collection of software tools, which address specific technical synthetic biology challenges while advancing the way in which users interact with computing environments. We also utilize advances in human-computer interaction (HCI) to communicate core concepts of synthetic biology to the public. Synbio Search is an online tool that generates data sheets for biological parts by aggregating data from various publicly available resources. MoClo Planner visualizes the Golden Gate Modular Cloning process and facilitates hierarchical design and production of multi-gene constructs. SynFlo is an interactive installation that utilizes tangible and tabletop HCI techniques to illustrate core concepts of synthetic biology in outreach programs. The application of novel HCI techniques to synthetic biology fosters the development of more effective, collaborative, and intuitive software tools, which enhance the design-build-test methodology.

GLP-1, a human innate neuro-peptide for energy balance, is chosen to combat for obesity and metabolic syndrome. We engineer the non-pathogenic E. coli which senses fatty acids in intestines and secretes synthetic GLP-1. Appropriate signal peptides and penetratin are used to facilitate peptide secretion and intestinal uptake. Furthermore, we design a circuit with quorum sensing and double repressors, which aims to generate quick but sustainable responses and serves as an anti-noise filter. Plasmid stabilization modules including partition system and multimer resolution system are also incorporated to circumvent the undesirable loss or segregational instability of our artificial device. With this general concept of delivery of short peptide into human body, we can also target other human diseases with alternative circuit designs.

It uses an engineered strain of Bacillus subtilis to detect and report volatiles in spoiling meat. The introduced genetic construct uses a promoter to trigger a pigment coding gene. This promoter, identified by microarray analysis, is significantly up-regulated in the presence of volatiles from spoiled meat. The activity of the promoter regulates the expression of the pigment reporter and will be visible to the naked eye. For safe usage of the system, spores of our engineered strain are placed into one half of a semi-permeable capsule, the second containing a calibrated amount of nutrients. Breaking the barrier between the two compartments allows germination and growth, thereby activating the spoiling meat sensor.

However, several serious issues remain: cytotoxicy, narrow dynamic range, and dependency on laser and exogenous chromophore. To circumvent these, Peking iGEM has rationally constructed a hypersensitive sensor of luminance- Luminesensor. Primarily, the sensor was designed by fusing blue-light-sensing protein domain from Neurospora with DNA binding domain of LexA from E.coli, following which protein structure inspection and kinetic simulation were conducted to rationally perform optimization. Amazingly, Luminesensor was proved to be as sensitive as to sense natural light and even bioluminescence. With this sensor, spatiotemporal control of cellular behavior, such as phototaxis, high-resolution 2-D and 3-D bio-printing using dim light and even luminescence of iPad were shown to be very easy. What’s more, we successfully implemented cell-cell signaling using light, which is the very first time in synthetic biology and of great importance for biotechnological use.
https://teams.igem.org/820	Foundational Advance	Fusion protein design has always been time- and design-intensive, to say the least. We are developing and characterizing a fusion construct containing a light sensitive domain, providing easy coupling and light activation of proteins of interest to investigators, thus developing a protein-level light-induced knockout. Using the LOV (Light, Oxygen, Voltage) domain commonly found in plants, where it enables light-directed growth, we are establishing guidelines for coupling proteins of interest to the LOV domain, which allows control of protein activity through blue wavelength light. Designing our reversible knockout at the protein level allows quick response times (2.2 microseconds activation time, 85 seconds deactivation time). A device of that kind could be of great importance as a tool for disinfection on a laboratory scale or mutant selection via blue light. Further potential applications of our LOV fusion system include bioreactor regulation or site-specific drug activation.
https://teams.igem.org/821	New Application	The Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence is a ribosome binding site several basepair ahead of start codon AUG. It interacts with the anti-Shine-Dalgarno (ASD) sequence in the 16S rRNA in the ribosome to initiate protein translation. By mutate the basepair in the SD and ASD sequence, we produced an orthogonal translation system where the canonical ribosome cannot translate the orthogonal mRNA, and vice versa. We call this system O-Key. Using the O-Key, we are able to strictly control the synthesis of desired product and prevent potential contamination to the publics and environment. We can even build a completely new orthogonal phage that can only infect our engineered E. coli. With these successful examples, we demonstrated a bright and secure future that guarantees the safety of the human and environment with our O-Key.
https://teams.igem.org/822	Village	One of the biggest problems with the cancer treatment used today is that normal chemotherapy is harming healthy cells in addition to cancer cells. Our approach for solving this problem has been to develop a genetic circuit that makes E.coli cells able to release toxic molecules only when in presence of cancer cells. As cancer cells grow faster than healthy cells, they also consume more oxygen and release more lactate than a healthy cell would do, so to make the E.coli cells recognize cancer cells we have made a system where the input signals are high lactate concentration and low oxygen concentration. When these criteria are met, the E.coli cells will undergo lysis, and release the toxin colicin, which our cells are producing constitutively. With our project, we want to show that one of the biggest challenges in medicine can be solved by synthetic biology.

The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease registry released a Priority List of Hazardous Substances (ASTDR). Heavy metals accounted for almost half of the top 10 substances; therefore, we have constructed a set of sensors that detects heavy metal contaminants in water. Our sensors provide an inexpensive, simple, and visual test for Arsenic (the number one substance from ASTDR’s list), Lead (number two), and Cadmium (number seven). One sensor paired a promoter responsive to both Cadmium and Arsenic with GFP as a reporter. Another was created for the detection of Lead and a third sensor was specific to cadmium. Use of the detector could potentially save lives around the world through early detection of the contamination.

We studied the rho-independent transcription terminators using both theoretical modeling and experiment method. We first developed a theoretical model. This model calculate the free energy of RNA folding and can predict the secondary structure of terminators. From the secondary structure, we proposed an algorithm that can calculate terminator efficiency. In the aspect of experiment, we construct 100 terminators. We measure the the terminator efficiency by measuring the GFP and RFP which are placed before and after terminators. The efficiency calculated from theoretical model fit quite well with experimental results. We also created a software and a web surver for people to calculate their terminators and also built a database of terminator efficiency which we believe to be the largest database of such kind.

Three major parts comprise the system: A chitin-sensor system that is activated in the presence of Hemileia vastatrix (coffee rust) or, alternatively, a device that senses 3OH-PAME, a diffusible signal of Ralstonia solanacearum, cause of bacterial wilt. A second construct, the communication device, receives the input from the sensor device and starts the production of salicylic acid, a plant hormone that stimulates an hypersensitive response in the plant.

Oral health requires a fine balance of these organisms, which can be upset by broad-spectrum antibiotics. Our experiments involved the use of the peptide based antibiotic actagardine, known to have activity against Streptococci. Homologs of actagardine were also incorporated into the designed gene cluster, in an effort to develop novel antimicrobial compounds. We sought to use synthetic biology tools to create a targeting system for an antibiotic to kill only Streptococcus mutans, the primary causative agent of dental cavities. A combinatorial approach applying phage display and heterologous expression of modified lantibiotics was applied to develop this targeted S. mutans killing machine.
https://teams.igem.org/833	Health & Medicine	In the initial stages of colon cancer, malignant cells give off excess heat, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and lactate. Last year, the BYU iGEM team genetically engineered E. coli to detect heat or ROS. This year we developed E. coli capable of simultaneously sensing lactate, heat and ROS, implemented a novel Cre-Lox system, and constructed a library of thermosensors. Our project uses two circuits, each with a unique reporter. The first circuit contains a RNA thermosensor driven by a ROS-inducible promoter, allowing expression of Cre recombinase when both heat and ROS are present. Although heat is transient, Cre ensures continued expression of the first reporter gene. The second circuit contains a periplasmic lactate sensor coupled to a second reporter. Finally, we have evolved a library of thermosensors that work in a narrow physiological range. Together, this two-circuit system may allow accurate and specific detection of early colon cancer cells.

Besides explanation and prediction, the ultimate goal of science is creation. Here, we create several regulatory RNAs as thermal metabolic controller. Pre-set a ‘switch-on’ temperature and a ‘switch-off’ temperature, in silico simulation will give the sequence of the regulatory RNA that meet the requirement. A step further, we apply our ‘Designable Thermoswitches’ to the field of fermentation industry. For a long time, engineers are trying to find a more economic and more automatic way to extract fermentation product inside the engineered microorganism. We align our ‘Designable Thermoswitches’ and gene of lysozyme together and put them into E.Coli to solve this problem. The reconstructed E.Coli will switch on the procedure of self-lysate at the given temperature. Thus, the fermentation product inside the engineered microorganism can be released.

https://teams.igem.org/840	New Application	Easily manipulated genetics make the yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> a versatile and widely used model eukaryote. To progress, researchers must often determine the mating type of haploid strains, which typically takes days. The goal of our project is to reduce that time to hours. So we designed a novel promoter harboring Ste12 and LexA binding sequences and placed it upstream of an ORF encoding a red fluorescent reporter fused to LexA binding and VP64 activator domains. Others have shown that this fusion protein induces its own expression from a LexA promoter. We propose that Ste12, activated in the pheromone response pathway, will bind the hybrid promoter and induce expression of the fusion protein, which will amplify and maintain its own expression. Therefore, when mating pheromone receptors on a haploid harboring this latch-type circuit are bound and activated, the cell will fluoresce and function as a rapid mating type detector.

Many strains of <i>E.coli</i> possess flagella which are controlled by a key group of genetic factors for assembly and chemotactic control. Regulation of these genes can be harnessed by creating combinations of promoters and individual components of the flagella apparatus. By promoting the synthesis of <i>E.coli</i> flagella genes and flagella activity under various conditions, such as salt concentration, nitrate concentration, pH and temperature, we can measure changes in flagella rotation and frequency. This frequency can be translated into an audible range, which indicates the bacteria’s distress and providing the researcher with a bacterial response to controlled growth conditions. Our system provides a new mechanism of bacterial communication with the researcher, through a spectrum of musical outputs. As such, we have named our system <i>E. musici</i>.

These applications include artificial tendons and ligaments, biomedical sutures, athletic gear, parachute cords, air bags, and other yet discovered products which require a high tensile strength with amazing extendibility. Spiders however cannot be farmed because they are territorial and cannibalistic. Thus, an alternative to producing spider silk must be found. We aim to engineer spider silk genes into E. coli to produce this highly valuable product. Spider silk production in bacteria has been limited due to the highly repetitive nature of the spider silk amino acids in the protein. To overcome this obstacle we are using various synthetic biology techniques to boost spider silk protein production and increase cellular fitness. After successful production, spider silk protein is artificially spun into usable fibers and tested for physical properties.
https://teams.igem.org/845	Information Processing	Multi-resistant bacteria are a worldwide issue which in a very near future will have huge impacts on our societies and ways diagnosis and prevention will be performed. In this optic, the Grenoble iGEM team has built an ultra-sensitive pathogen detector. It consists of three interconnected modules: 1- Detection, 2- Amplification/ Communication and 3- Output. The detection module consists of a recombinant membrane receptor that, once activated, actuates an amplification loop. The amplification system contains a genetic feed forward loop, which filters out false positive outputs. Once amplified and filtered, the signal is transmitted to neighboring bacteria via a diffusible molecule. In turn, the amplification loop is triggered which leads to the production of a measurable fluorescence output. The design of our network is easily adaptable to different input signals by using other receptor domains.

https://teams.igem.org/847	New Application	Astrobiology revolves around three central questions: “Where do we come from?”, “Where are we going?”, and “Are we alone?” The Stanford-Brown iGEM team explored synthetic biology’s untapped potential to address these questions. To approach the second question, the Hell Cell subgroup developed BioBricks that allow a cell to survive harsh extraterrestrial conditions. Such a toolset could create a space-ready synthetic organism to perform useful functions off-world. For example, the Biomining branch attempted to engineer bacteria to recycle used electronics by degenerating silica and extracting metal ions in situ. The Venus Life subproject grappled with the third key astrobiological question by exploring Carl Sagan’s theory that life could exist in Venusian clouds. To this end, Venus Life designed a cell-cycle reporter to test for growth in aerosol within an adapted Millikan apparatus. Through this triad of projects, Stanford-Brown iGEM aimed to illuminate synthetic biology’s value as a tool for astrobiology.
https://teams.igem.org/848	WIKI	This project aims at creating a regulatory system in the bacteria Escherichia coli. Our main goal is to engineer a single strain of bacteria able produce concentric patterns on the dishes. The challenge is to model a regulatory mechanism which mimics both cell differentiation and cell-to-cell communication observed in eukaryotes. We chose to create four operons (a total of 21 assemblies): three to allow the communication and expression of a visible phenotype, the fourth containing the genes needed for signal transduction. Each of the three first operons will respond to a specific quorum-sensing system (QSS) and trigger another QSS resulting in a chain reaction communicating a unique signal to all bacteria nearby. We also developed our model in silico to run simulation and test parameters that influence pattern propagation on a petri dish.

However it has been used as a traditional food ingredient by Paraguayan natives, for example to sweeten mate tea. The iGEM Team Frankfurt wants to transfer the pathway of the plant into baker yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) to make stevia production much cheaper. Furthermore microbial production of these sweetening compounds could also lower the environmental costs of Sweetener production. In addition to these advantages, it would be possible to selectively produce only the most flavorful compounds. Several of known problems with carbohydrate sweeteners like diabetes or caries could be overcome by the Steviolglycosides which are produced by <i>Stevia rebaudiana</i>. Another interesting perspective is the capability of Steviolglycosides to reduce the blood sugar value.

Acetobacter xylinum naturally produces mats of cellulose that can be used for a variety of purposes. We wanted to create a broader spectrum of materials, so we altered the properties of the cellulose mats by engineering Acetobacter to express enzymes that synthesize N-acetyl glucosamine, a subunit of chitin. The result is a chitin-cellulose copolymer with unique properties. We have also engineered colors into the mats, and demonstrated their use in modern architectural design.

We are working on the creation of different strains of Bacillus subtilis, each one will be able to perform a single Boolean operation just like a transistor. A single transistor is not a computer, they need to communicate with others to perform new logic operations, but how our bacterial transistors can communicate? In 2011, Ben-Yehuda et. al. identified a type of bacterial communication mediated by nanotubes that bridge neighboring cells, providing a network for exchange of cellular molecules within and between species. By using these nanotubes our bacterium will be capable to communicate with others so that create complex networks of logic gates. Using this it could be possible to develop a complex network of transistors" to create for example a synthetic metabolic pathway."
https://teams.igem.org/852	WIKI	Objective - Naturally occurring organisms using polystyrene as their sole source of carbon have been recently identified, by analysing the occurrence of polystyrene breakdown products. However these metabolites accumulate very slowly, explaining why polystyrene is so persistent in the environment. Polystyrene can currently be recycled, but due to the low density of the majority of polystyrene products it is economically unfavourable, due to the high energy demands. If inexpensive biological degradation can be achieved this would assist recycling, but we also hope to use products of this reaction to make useful organic chemicals. Aim - To construct BioBricks from the genes encoding enzymes involved in this pathway and manipulate their expression and properties to maximise the rate of polystyrene degradation. Hypothesis - genes encoding the enzymes of the polystyrene breakdown pathway can be isolated and expressed in a host microorganism and the rate of the process increased by genetic manipulation.

PvdQ, an enzyme naturally produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is an acylase that functions to degrade long chain AHLs that bacteria like Pseudomonas putida or aeruginosa itself utilize for biofilm formation. Biofilms are population density-dependent structures formed by quorum sensing bacteria that produce and secrete auto-inducers, which signal selective gene transcription. These signaling molecules, namely the AHLs, are responsible for most bacterial pathogenicity including the opportunistic respiratory infections caused by P.aeuroginosa in immunocompromised patients.

Isolation and concentration of specific isomers is of immense biological importance to pharmaceutical industries. We plan to try and simplify this process by separating commercially important compounds using a biological system instead of traditional chemical methods which can be very resource intensive and time consuming. We also plan to develop a high-throughput system for screening of drugs which act on the Estrogen receptor using E. coli. Finally, we wish to provide an efficient means for the bioremediation of endocrine disruptors prevalent in the Indian subcontinent which have an adverse impact on the country’s population.

In the fermentation process E. coli converts glucose into various intermediate states to generate energy. The transduction of the adhE knockout found in JW1228-2 to FMJ39 will produce a triple mutant with the following genes deleted: ldhA, pflB, and adhE. From these deletions insertions of mhpF, pyruvate decarboxylase, and ferredoxin oxidoreductase will result in a more direct metabolic line towards hydrogen production.

Future applications of this project include incorporation into plants to naturally prevent food rot as well as the possible development of a probiotic for human consumption to prevent the pathogenesis of bacteria whose toxicity is dependent on quorum sensing. In addition to this project, we isolated and submitted the 6 essential genes in the Lux brick (LuxA,B,C,D,E, and G) from its original source, Vibrio Fisheri, because many teams have been unsuccessful with the previously submitted Lux parts.

By the designer, user can design minimal genomes by essential genes which are analogized by our team in this year. The minimal genome can be designed depending on characteristics of species by inserting the function of genes into particular locations. With the second tool, brick-designer, user can design new bio-bricks. It is also able to synthesize bricks by using the bricks registered in partsregistry.

This year, we WHU-China team engineered a probiotics “<i>E. coslim</i>” from <i>Escherichia coli</i>, hoping to provide a new approach for treating obesity. Specifically, three genetic devices were designed. The first two devices were assembled to sense and response to fatty acids and glucose. To achieve these goals, promoters repressed by FadR and CRP were devised and synthesized respectively. When functional genes are placed downstream of these promoters appropriately, the two devices are supposed to degrade fatty acids and convert glucose into cellulose rapidly, thus preventing excessive calorie intake as well as producing prebiotics. Meanwhile, the third device was designed to control the densities of “<i>E. coslim</i>” and forestall horizontal gene transfer in future applications. As a whole, by simulating, we are developing “<i>E. coslim</i>” to regulate the microbiome composition in intestine to reduce risks of obesity.

As the discovery of new antibiotics lags behind, we are developing new methods for targeting the resistance itself - making resistant bacteria sensitive to old antibiotics once again. Working with real-world resistance genes from multi-resistant bacteria isolated at hospitals, we are developing anti-resistance systems to strike at three different levels: DNA, transcriptional and translational level. At DNA level, we develop a method for increasing resistance plasmid loss rate. At transcriptional level, we use super-repressors to repress transcription of resistance genes and native defense mechanisms. At translational level, we develop a modular system for high-throughput screening of sRNAs to silence resistance genes. We also provide tools useful for the whole synbio community, such as new standard backbones and methods for scarless gene deletion.

https://teams.igem.org/865	Foundational Advance	RNA has characteristics that are important in human gene expression (i.e. alternative splicing of mRNA, noncoding RNA). Therefore, a modular RNA binding protein is an invaluable tool for gene regulation. The PUF domain of human PUM1 gene contains eight tandem repeats, each recognizing one of the four nucleotide bases. In theory, a PUF protein can be programmed to recognize any 8-nt ssRNA sequence. Here we demonstrate that PUF can be tethered with other functional domains for applications in E. Coli. Specifically, we show that a PUF/endonuclease fusion protein acts as RNA scissors, silencing gene expression through site specific mRNA cleavage. PUF was also tethered to split GFP to test its ability to co-localize proteins using a RNA scaffold. PUF biobricks offer a wide range of possible functions including gene expression modulation and scaffolding of metabolic pathways.

This diversity is generated by random VDJ-recombination of a limited number of antibody subfragments. This inspired us to construct an automatic recombination system in E. coli that generates large numbers of novel proteins by combinatorial fusion of functional domains. The site-specific DNA recombinase Gin of bacteriophage Mu depends on the presence of a DNA enhancer element for efficient recombination. This allowed us to construct a system, called “The Recombinator”, which automatically shuts down after successful recombination. We visualized the randomizing function of our genetically engineered slot machine by combining colors with cellular localization domains. By scaling up the number of recombination modules and functional domains our system will be able to generate a multitude of new proteins. We envision that “The Recombinator” will serve as a tool to create novel enzymatic activities for innovative drug design, environmental detoxification and metabolic engineering.

Also, an association of the H+/HCO3- ratio and the signaling pathway of adenilate cyclase has been seen. The employment of these genes with reporter proteins can be used to indirectly calculate the concentration of environmental CO2. The CO2 concentration depends on the partial pressure and the speed with it is assimilated by the liquid. The fastest it gets to the saturation point 5%, the higher is the CO2 concentration.

Using three quorum signaling molecules we create unique connections between different populations of engineered bacteria and perform coordinated computing functions.

Unfortunately, the efficiency of some of these reactions may render their applications logistically unrealistic.

The scaffolding protein can be reduced in size and adapted for the cell surface of Escherichia coli. Different cohesion sites on the new cell surface display protein can also be introduced to allow for attachment of desired enzymes. Future applications would include producing a collection of distinct versions of the scaffolding protein for unique arrangements and concentrations of enzymes, enabling construction of an extra-cellular assembly line for a variety of multi-enzymatic reactions.

The end goal of our project was to create spatial color patterns using bacteria, such as a color wheel and a rainbow, that required control over several color outputs in response to spatial gradients of chemical inducers. Colour gradients were achieved using a high-copy plasmid that contained both an inducible colour gene and its corresponding repressor. Colour banding was achieved by a novel means of adjusting gene expression through plasmid copy number control that varied from 0 to ~1000 copies/cell as a function of inducer concentration. Note that the rapid loss of plasmid that occurs in the absence of inducer also constitutes a novel and extremely effective safety switch for genetically engineered organisms which might enter the environment.
https://teams.igem.org/880	Foundational Advance	Recombinases can be used to create responsive, low background, boolean genetic circuits in biological systems. Further, it is theoretically possible to create complex control circuits using combinations of invertible DNA sequences. We utilized the recombinase HbiF to augment an existing system in Escherichia coli that relied on the recombinase FimE. A burst of induced, low level expression of one recombinase will invert the promoter flanked by the recombinase binding sites, triggering a switch from strong expression of one set of proteins to another set. Induced expression of the second recombinase will revert the promoter to its original orientation, triggering the original set of protein expression. The inversion will be sustained across cell divisions with little leaky protein expression and negligible performance degradation after repeated inversions. This is a heritable, binary memory system and can be used as a component in more complex systems.

A high-energy diet, increases the amount of LPS-producing gut microbiota, and increased LPS levels has been observed in obese individuals. By inducing changes in the gut microbiota by prebiotics, like inulin, it is possible to decrease the plasma LPS level. This is associated with the stimulation of bifidobacterial growth. We have designed a novel approach to address this issue of plasma LPS, by probioticly induce changes in the gut flora by genetically modifying a bacteria to produce plant originated inulin. We cloned the two genes encoding sucrose:sucrose fructosyltransferase (SST) and fructose:fructose fructosyltransferase (FFT) from the Jerusalem artichoke into a E. coli, where it will produce inulin by using sucrose as an acceptor molecules. In the future this construct should be introduced by a probiotic lactobacillus, into the gut.
https://teams.igem.org/900	Information Processing	Many applications in synthetic biology demand precise control over subcellular localization, cell morphology, motility, and other such phenotypes that are only observable via microscopy. At present, engineering these properties is challenging due in large part to the inherent throughput limitation imposed by microscopy. We have developed a strategy that enables high-throughput library screening with microscopy by coupling a unique fluorescence signature with each genotype present in a library. These MiCodes (microscopy barcodes) are generated by targeting combinations of fluorophores to several organelles within yeast, and they eliminate the need to isolate and observe clonal populations separately. MiCodes can potentially scale to library sizes of 10^6 or more, and their analysis can be largely automated using existing image processing software. As a proof of principle, we applied MiCodes to the problem of finding unique pairs of protein-protein interaction parts.
https://teams.igem.org/901	Manufacturing	Increasing global oil demands require innovative technologies for the extraction of unconventional oil sources such as those found in Alberta’s Carbonate Triangle. Microbial enhanced oil recovery (MEOR) has been utilized across the world to increase the productivity of these difficult resources. Using a synthetic biology approach, we have designed the CAB (CO2, acetic acid, biosurfactant) extraction method for a modified MEOR to extract carbonate oil deposits. CAB extraction will utilize natural carbon fixation machinery in the cyanobacteria Synechococcus elongatus to convert CO2 into sugars to fuel acetic acid and biosurfactant production in Escherichia coli. Acetic acid and biosurfactant applied to carbonate rock will facilitate and enhance extraction. The use of carbon fixation to feed downstream systems can be tailored for many applications requiring inexpensive methods for fueling biological systems, while simultaneously reducing greenhouse gas emissions. CAB extraction provides an alternative, inexpensive, and environmentally sustainable MEOR method for carbonate oil deposits.
https://teams.igem.org/902	WIKI	Tailings ponds are concentrated pools of toxic and corrosive compounds resulting from oil and mining extraction. The Calgary iGEM team aims to alleviate this potential environmental and economic threat by developing a detection and bioremediation system for these toxins: FRED (Functional, Robust Electrochemical Detector) and OSCAR (Optimized System for Carboxylic Acid Remediation). FRED detects multiple compounds within one sample using an electrochemical output. We created an open-source hardware and software platform to be used as a biosensor prototype. For OSCAR, we designed and modeled a bioreactor to remove impurities (sulfur, nitrogen, and carboxylic acids) from tailings ponds. Known degradative microbial pathways were combined with unique engineering solutions in a bioreactor model. Furthermore, we developed ‘Ribo-kill-switches’ to prevent antibiotic resistance and disturbing natural flora. Overall, this system aims to detect and convert toxins into clean hydrocarbons in an economical, safe, and self-contained process.

https://teams.igem.org/905	Village	Bacteria targeting cancer therapy: Salmonella typhimurium-VNP20009 with its unique characteristic of accumulating in nutrient-rich or hypoxic tissues can be adapted to tumor targeted therapy. However, recent researches revealed that S. typhimurium can survive in other normal tissues, resulting in damage or inflammatory response. Our project aims to improve the therapeutic property of S. typhimurium by modifying its amino acids-synthesizing genes and screen highly tumor-targeted strains. Then we standardize them to construct a general element used specifically in hypoxic tissues. The hypoxic feature in the core areas of tumors made it possible for S. typhimurium to target tumors specifically. Our goal is to screen the anaerobic promoter that can express efficiently in S. typhimurium and ligate it with genes of anti-cancer drugs. The double properties of the strains and promoters enable anti-cancer drugs to express specifically in tumors, fulfilling our goal of decreasing toxic and side effects of the drugs.
https://teams.igem.org/906	Food & Energy	Saffron is highly valued as a spice that adds unmatched flavor, aroma, and color to food. A project was designed to synthesize three chemicals which compose a significant portion of the aroma and coloration of the spice saffron: safranal, picrocrocin, and crocin. Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 was chosen as the chassis because of its photosynthetic nature and native production of the substrate, zeaxanthin. It was proposed that the cloning of two genes ZCD and UGTCs2, would be sufficient to make the compounds in this organism. These two were cloned into E. coli in conjunction with the genes necessary to produce zeaxanthin. ZCD was successfully cloned into E. coli with the aid of a fusion protein to minimize the presence of inclusion bodies. This result was confirmed by SDS-PAGE followed by trypsin digestion and LC-MS/MS. With this groundwork laid, future work can produce a biosynthetic alternative to saffron.

https://teams.igem.org/908	New Application	In synthetic biology, one of the main issues scientists and engineers must tackle is biochemical pathways optimization. In this project, we are going to develop an exceptional natural tool that could be used to optimize bio-production pathways: the integron. Integrons are genetic platforms which contain (re)movable gene cassettes. These integrons are mostly known to carry resistances to antibiotics. They are flanked with recombination sites which allow gene shuffling inside the integron thanks to a specific enzyme: the integrase. With appropriate selective pressure, this shuffling should result in optimized production. As a proof of concept, we are going to produce two antibiotics: Microcin C7 and Microcin B17. Two bacteria possessing the integron containing the antibiotics production gene cassettes, the integrase and a low resistance to the opposite antibiotic will be put in competition. With the integrase, we could change the natural order of the genes in order to optimize production.
https://teams.igem.org/909	WIKI	E.colipse is an intelligent and adaptive sun radiation protection system which responds to UV exposure with the production of the protective agent pABA. To detect hazardous levels of sun radiation our system is based on UVR-8, a UV sensing protein from plants. In its dark state, this protein forms a homodimer that dissociates upon UV radiation. We fused UVR-8 with the DNA binding domain from TetR, which is unable to dimerize and to bind DNA in monomeric form. UV-exposure might force the TetR-UVR8 fusion dimer to split, release the DNA and enable transcription. Thus, TetR-UVR8 might act as a light-activated on-switch in bacteria. We plan to use this novel switch to start the production of para-aminobenzoic acid (pABA), a common ingredient of sunscreen, and - dependent on the intensity and duration of exposure as determined by our detailed in silico model - a colored pigment as a visible warning signal.
https://teams.igem.org/910	New Application	We designed a system that allows controlling the expression of a gene or an operon over a specific temperature interval (between 32 and 42 degrees Celsius). This system consists of an RNA thermometer controlling the translation of a thermosensitive transcriptional repressor, which itself controls the expression of the targeted gene or operon. In our current construction, the crtEBI operon directing lycopene biosynthesis is used as a reporter, allowing us to check our system's performance. However, the possible applications of this system are extremely numerous. For example, controlling the expression of a toxin would allow creating a “suicidal bacterium” that would bring on its own death outside the specified temperature range. This will help preventing its spread in the environment. And this is just one example... The only limit is our imagination !
https://teams.igem.org/911	Foundational Advance	Implementation of biosensors in real world situations has been made difficult by the unpredictable and non-quantified outputs of existing solutions, as well as a lack of appropriate storage, distribution and utilization systems. This leaves a large gap between a simple, functional sensing mechanism and a fully realised product that can be used in the field. We aim to bridge this gap at all points by developing a standardised ratiometric luciferase output in a Bacillus chassis. This output can be linked up with prototyped instrumentation and software for obtaining reliable quantified results. Additionally, we have reduced the specialized requirements for the storage and distribution of our bacteria by using Bacillus' sporulation system. To improve the performance of our biosensing platform we have genetically modified Bacillus’ germination speed. Lastly, we demonstrated the robustness of our system by testing it with a new fluoride riboswitch, providing the opportunity to tackle real life problems.
https://teams.igem.org/912	Health & Medicine	Iron deficiency affects 2 billion people - or over 30% of the world’s population – and can lead to anemia, ill health, and even death. Surprisingly, this deficiency is typically not due to a lack of dietary iron, but rather due to low bio-availability, and thus poor absorption of iron. Phytic acid is a prevalent chelator of iron and other nutrients in food. Our mission is to build a system that breaks down phytic acid in the digestive system, releasing bound iron for the body to absorb. Our solution comprises two engineered components: a module that constitutively produces phytase to break down phytic acid and a pH-sensitive module that causes cells to lyse and release the accumulated phytase in the stomach. If successful, our strain would be a low-cost sustainable solution to preventing iron deficiency without the need for constant supplies of iron supplements.
https://teams.igem.org/914	Village	Many synthetic biology projects propose the application of Genetically Engineered Organisms (GEOs) in natural environments. However, issues of biosafety and ethics constrain the use of GEOs outside the lab. A primary concern is the Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT) of synthetic genes to natural populations. Strategies developed to address this problem provide varying levels of containment, however, the substantial elimination of HGT remains difficult or perhaps impossible. We have developed a new containment system to expand the range of environments where GEOs can be used safely. To do so, we rely on three levels of containment: physical containment with alginate capsules, semantic containment using an amber suppressor system, and an improved killswitch featuring delayed population-level suicide through complete genome degradation. We aim to raise the issue of biosafety by engaging the general public and scientific community through debate, and to advocate the discerning use of biosafety circuits in future iGEM projects.

https://teams.igem.org/916	Information Processing	Our goal is to engineer a novel biosensor with a faster readout than is currently available. Many bacteria produce, secrete, and respond to chemicals called autoinducers to monitor population density and to synchronize gene expression, a process called quorum sensing. In quorum sensing based biosensors, detection of autoinducer activates transcription of a reporter gene, which must then be translated and accumulate to detectable levels, which can take two to four hours. In our system, we will use TraR, a protein used in the quorum sensing response of <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i>, which dimerizes only in the presence of its autoinducer. We have successfully fused <i>traR</i> to sequence for two separate complementary fragments of GFP. Upon addition of autoinducer, we predict that already accumulated TraR-GFP fragment monomers will dimerize, allowing the GFP fragments to interact and fluoresce. This new approach may drastically reduce the time necessary for future biosensors to produce detectable output.

We seek to implement the MtrCAB electron transfer system from Shewanella oneidensis into E. coli, and test the resulting electron output from the organisms using microbial fuel cells. We are constructing computer models of the electron transfer chain and of cell survival with non-antibiotic markers. This tools-based project responds directly to legislation and safety.

Our search for an enzyme capable of breaking down gluten and neutralizing its toxicity led us to the enzyme mutated by the 2011 UW IGEM team. The modified Kumamolisin-As has a maximal activity at a pH of 4 and would work well in the pH range of 5.2-5.5 found in beer. For expression in yeast we had to account for codon bias, and optimized the sequence so it could more easily be moved from a prokaryotic system to a eukaryotic one.

However, quantitative information about the expression strength of a synthetic promoter has been difficult to obtain due to the lack of noninvasive and real-time approaches to measure the levels of both RNA and protein in cells. Here, we engineer a fluorogen-activated bio-sensor that can provide information on both transcription strength and translation efficiency. This biosensor is noninvasive, easily applied to a variety of promoters, and more efficient than existing technologies. To demonstrate the utility of our biosensor, we constructed and characterized several designed T7Lac hybrid promoters. Furthermore, we developed a mathematical model of our synthetic system to guide experiments and an open-source electronic kit that mimics experimental setup and well suited for education purposes. Our results could have a broad impact on the measurement and standardization of synthetic biological parts.

While rice can be fortified using vitamin powders, such approaches have had limited success because many vitamins are leeched away during the washing process prior to cooking. To address this problem, we have engineered proteins that will adhere nutrients to rice grains and prevent losses. These proteins contain a starch-binding domain that is fused to specific nutrient-binding domains. Because rice is composed mainly of starch, the starch-binding domain prevents nutrient leeching during washing. Upon cooking, the nutrient-binding domain denatures and releases the nutrients into the cooked rice. Supplementing rice with these fusion proteins will provide a novel, non-GMO approach to fortifying rice. Proteins with a starch-binding domain connected to a vitamin B12-binding domain, a thiamine-binding domain, a lysine-rich protein, and a RFP have been created.

We designed a system to accelerate the adhesion of bacteria to surfaces. On biofilm aggregation, expression of silica-binding peptides works to build silica matrices on the surface of cells. These matrices act as a mechanical filter for large particles and a barrier between the biofilm and fluid shear, decreasing dislodgment of organisms that could otherwise lead to fouling. We envision these improved biofilms being used in municipal water treatment to help recycle and filter home waste water streams, a concept we implemented in lab-scale membrane bioreactors.

Variations in RBS translation initiation rates and length between start codons provide additional data. Repeating sequences of non-degenerative threonine and alanine codons measure codon bias and determine E. coli DH10B’s ability to translate varying lengths of identical codons through the use of mCherry and GFP reporters.

Bacteria have an efflux operon regulated by an arsenic sensitive inducible promoter. It is possible through recombinant DNA technology to isolate this promoter and combine it to a reporter system and transform bacteria to create a biosensor for arsenic. Induction of the arsenic-sensitive promoter occurs by the binding of arsenite to an inhibitory protein, de-repressing transcription. We have observed the arsenic responsive promoter from E. coli to have a consistent, low level of background induction. We have tested the hypothesis that by increasing the quantity of the inhibitory protein in the cell, we can quantifiably raise the threshold of the response. Our intention is to create a tunable biosensor to form the basis of a low-tech device that can reliably detect dangerous levels of arsenic in water for use in the developing world.

The extensive use of fertilizers and the inability of sewage treatment plants to break down drug waste lead to increasingly high concentrations of so-called endocrine disruptors in rivers. As a result, male fish have been found to be less fertile and even develop female sex tissue, so called ovotesties.

In order to address these issues we’ve created an optogenetic tool kit in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using the CIB1/CRY2 optogenetic system. In this system, the CIB1-VP16AD and CRY2-Gal4BD fusion proteins dimerize in the presence of blue light leading to gene expression at the Gal1 promoter. Using flow cytometry we characterized four different fluorescent proteins for use in our tool kit using a galactose activation assay. After characterizing our network, also using flow cytometry, we developed several protein expression assays for medical genetics. Finally, in order to confirm network success in silico, we utilized the modeling software TinkerCell to generate a stochastic model of our optogenetic network.

https://teams.igem.org/957	Environment	Cell-based biosensors have potential uses in environmental monitoring for toxins, medical diagnostics, and drug discovery. However, current methods for information output from whole cells (fluorescence, luminescence, pH) are very cumbersome to measure. To overcome this obstacle, the Cornell iGEM team has developed a new generation of biosensors capable of a direct current output which can be recorded easily with high precision. By upregulating the metal-reduction pathway of  Shewanella oneidensis in the presence of a target compound, these sensors can act as a continuos monitoring system. While our system is adaptable to sensing a wide range of analytes, we have focused on the detection of arsenic-containing compounds and naphthalene, which are common contaminants in oil sands tailings. Furthermore, we have integrated these organisms within a field-deployable device capable of wireless data transmission – a fully autonomous electrochemical biosensor.

https://teams.igem.org/976	Section	According to the World Health Organization, 132,000 people are diagnosed with melanoma skin cancer each year and 48,000 deaths occur from this diagnosis. The development of a yeast based early detection system has the potential to save thousands of lives. Team MCIT Indianapolis is working on a topical cream that will detect the early onset of malignant melanoma. The biosensor system will be developed within a Saccharomyces cerevisiae chassis, using a plasmid containing Firefly Luciferase and Renilla coding that will enable fluorescence in the presence of precancerous cells. The bioengineered yeast will express the receptor protein FGFR-1 on its surface allowing the device to detect increased levels of Basic Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF2) commonly expressed by precancerous melanocytes. Detection of bFGF will initiate the production of Firefly Luciferase and Renilla proteins, which will cause the yeast to fluoresce showing the patient where potential malignant melanoma cells may be located.
https://teams.igem.org/977	Section	Humans rely on carbon resources for nutrition and energy. Through industrialization we have become dependent on non-renewable fossil fuels to the detriment of the environment. Recent research into renewable biofuels has included work on the production of corn-based ethanol and the microbial degradation of cellulose from terrestrial plants. Biofuels derived from these sources are not fully sustainable. Third generation biofuels include those derived from microalgae. Cyanbacteria are microalgae known to fix carbon dioxide into alkanes through the collective processes of photosynthesis, glycolysis, and fatty acid biosynthesis. The CAPS iGEM Team 2013 begins metabolic engineering of these pathways by expressing a rabbit muscle derived pyruvate kinase, known to be a key regulator of glycolysis, within the cyanobacteria Synechocystis PCC 6803 in an effort to increase alkane production. Pathways will be modeled using TinkerCell and assays for the production of pyruvate, fatty acids, and alkanes will be used to characterize our system.
https://teams.igem.org/978	North America	Renewable energy needs are higher than ever before requiring new alternative methods of fuel production. Our team is using E. coli bacteria which we will transform with two new genes. Proteorhodopsin is the first protein produced from the first gene, which is a light driven proton pump that will allow the bacteria to produce ATP from sunlight. The second protein will allow the bacteria to ferment sugars into ethanol. The sunlight driven energy will allow for more of the sugar to be used for ethanol fermentation than actual consumption so the output will be higher. The bacteria will in time be placed in a panel that will allow it to gather sunlight and produce ethanol daily which will be distilled and gathered. For now we are just focusing on the creation of the bacteria with the two new genes.

https://teams.igem.org/980	High School	In an effort to expand the toolkit available to synthetic biologists, we've taken a system natively responsible for transcriptional activation and modified it to control transcriptional repression. The LasR system from Pseudomonas Aeruginosa requires the presence of a small molecule, C12-3-oxo-AHL, to induce activation of the Plas promoter. By modifying the -10 and -35 sites of the promoter, as well as shifting the location of the LasR binding sites, the new Plas promoter (Plas*) was changed from an inducible to a repressible promoter. Through adding this second functionality, the Plas* promoter could be used in conjunction with a wildtype Plas promoter to control two separate genes whose expression levels are always out of sync. Furthermore, if the bacteria are transfected with a plasmid encoding LasI, the bacteria will be able to turn off gene expression at a critical population density, instead of only being able to turn on gene expression.
https://teams.igem.org/981	WIKI	12.5 million tonnes of paper and cardboard are used annually in the UK. We are proposing an alternative solution, a home system that converts cellulose into glucose that allows the up-cycling of paper into a commercial product of PHBs. Consumers who have the home system would be able to rather than put the bio-plastic into a recycling bin to be collected, they can instead exchange their bio-plastic for money. Exchanging recyclable objects for monetary gain, has been used in many European countries where the consumer exchanges plastic and glass bottles. We decided to construct a two stage apparatus containing two reactors- first reactor contains cellulolytic enzymes that output glucose. A filtered feed from the first enters the second (containing Cupriavidus metallidurans), a PHB producing organism. Ideally we would like both parts to be contained in one stage reactor where all organisms and enzymes would be placed in one compartment.

Blood typing is important because it can transfuse blood and identify individuals; in addition, changes in pattern of blood type antigen expression can even demonstrate malignancy. The current blood typing approaches mainly include slide agglutination, absorption-agglutination, PCR-RFLP and PCR-sequencing based method. In this project, we will use bacterial surface display method to display specific antibody (against type A or type B antigen) section (single-chain variable fragment, ScFv) onto the surface of the bacteria, thus expressing GFP or RFP. Bacteria producing ScFv and cells containing blood antigen will adhere to each other by incubation if the corresponding antigen exists on target cells, so we can characterize blood types and identify the intensity of the antigens on cell surface.
https://teams.igem.org/985	North America	Biosensors provide a wide variety of applications, particularly analyte detection in the environment. Positive results in biosensors lead to the output of a reporter, commonly in the form of fluorescent proteins. Here we construct a biosensor that is capable of indicating the presence of various pollutants in water through expression of several different fluorescent proteins. We selected lead, copper, phosphate, and nitrate/nitrite promoters and paired them with specific reporter coding sequences. Presence of these ions drives the transcription of specific fluorescent proteins. Detection of these proteins is enabled through a light detection apparatus and the information can be sent to mobile devices in a user-friendly interface via a modified Google ADK. This novel multibiosensor can be implemented to detect pollutants in sewer systems, septic tanks, and other sources of water, and provide an early-detection warning system, preventing the pollutants from causing serious harm to equipment, animals, or people.

When Eutrophication occurs, water-bloom will explosively boosted in water and caused heavy casualty of aquative living beings due to hypoxia. Our project is working on digesting phosphate in water. Due to our research, once we control the N/P ratio can we effectively control the situation of Eutrophication. And we manily focus on digesting Phosphate. Our project is consited of two connected devices. The first device contains a phosphate sensitive promoter which can be induced by phosphate starvation, a RFP system, and a supressor protein. Device 2, contains a promoter which is limited by the suppressor protein featured in Device 1, a PPK coding sequence that is key in digesting phosphate and a GFP with LVA that allows the bacteria to emit a green fluorescence while it is doing so.
https://teams.igem.org/987	High School	Our project is about a genetic engineered machine in <i>E. coli</i> with the ability to produce Vip3ca3 which acts as a pesticide protein. Vip3ca3 production will be regulated by specific temperatures in order to avoid overproduction and it will show activity against target organisms Coleoptera and Lepidoptera, which are related to a local problem concerning potato crops. The Vip3ca3 production is regulated with a constitutive promoter and a riboswitch that initiate translation around 32°C. Since we want to produce the Vip3ca3 below the 32°C, we use a set of promoter-repressors in order to invert the activation of the protein production. This model may be used as a regulator in future transgenic plant generations for the production of substances against plagues, avoiding pesticide overproduction, thus reducing the effect in Non-Target Organisms and bioaccumulation and can be used with different temperature ranges and/or different proteins to attack other target organisms.
https://teams.igem.org/988	Section	This project revolves around the production of the hormone oxytocin within a bacterial cell. Due to the short half-life of the hormone, it is difficult to study and expensive to store and transport. The ultimate goal is to allow for oxytocin to be produced quickly, efficiently, and inexpensively to allow healthcare professionals and researchers access to a hormone that is not yet well understood. To accomplish this we will be constructing two separate systems: one to produce the Oxytocin-Neurophysin compound, and the other to produce NEC1, a cleavage enzyme responsible for detaching oxytocin from its carrier molecule which stabilizes oxytocin. The second system will be optimized to produce NEC1 at a rate that will allow maximal efficiency between production and cleavage. Upon completion, we intend to thoroughly characterize our parts and then submit them to the registry. Our human practices component is rooted in public education about synthetic biology."
https://teams.igem.org/989	North America	Wound oxygenation is a key determinant of wound healing because oxygen is crucial to the healing process and for resistance to infection. Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from existing vessels, is essential for tissue repair and can increase oxygen delivery to wounds, enhancing growth and recovery. Production of growth factors such as fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) can be elevated to promote angiogenesis in possible chronic wounds. To address inadequate oxygen during wound healing, we coupled the VHb promoter to a downstream gene encoding FGF. The VHb promoter is activated at an oxygen threshold below 2%, inducing transcription of the FGF gene in response to hypoxic conditions. We also tested the production of KGF under the influence of various constitutive promoters. This oxygen-sensing device is an addition to the growing treatments targeted towards angiogenesis promotion to improve healing in patients with severe wounds.
https://teams.igem.org/990	Section	Today, communication between bacteria is a very commonly used technique. It is a system which is permanently tried to improve and mostly required for the purpose of enhancing a signal or for activating chain reaction pathways. Our goal is to develop an alternative way of signal transfer instead of the classic manner by using chemicals like the quorum sensing molecule Acyl Homoserine Lactone (AHL) or several inducible promoters. Within our project, we will analyze the potential of a single bacterium to affect another bacterium or colony solely by the products of simple biochemical pathways like light or color and finally the effectiveness of the whole system. Regarding the importance of safety procedures, we will test the ability of a colony to induce the death of another colony by photo-communication and the effects on developing a secondary resistance beside the backbone resistance against contamination cases.

https://teams.igem.org/992	Section	Our project aims to improve the bioluminescence system of Escherichia coli in which bioluminescene protein from Vibrio fischeri is expressed. The 2010 Cambridge iGEM team increased the duration of bioluminescence by making H-NS mutant E. coli strains, derepressing the Lux gene repression. We engineered E. coli to overexpress phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Pck) to harbor a high intracellular ATP concentration and express proteorhodopsin to make ATP production possible when nutrients were limited. However, contrary to our prediction, the intensity and duration of bioluminescence in E. coli did not increase. After further literature search, though, we discovered that replenishing FMNH2 is crucial in maintaining bioluminescence. Therefore, to maintain a high redox pool, our team will utilize pathways that can increase redox pool or couple ATP concentration with NAD+ reduction in response to ATP formation.

We plan to use red, yellow and green fluorescent proteins in a traffic light system, whereby the colour of the protein translated corresponds to the concentration of lactose, with red fluorescent protein denoting a high concentration of lactose, yellow fluorescent protein representing a low concentration of lactose and green fluorescent protein showing that there is no lactose present. It is our hope that this could potentially be used in allergy testing and in the analysis of food samples, and by a spectrum individuals who are lactose intolerant.

Every time the oil is transferred there is an opportunity for some spillage. Our project would allow anyone to easily and quickly differentiate between more and less dangerous spills. Early identification of contamination will facilitate rapid clean-up and minimize health risks. Our project has been the development of ECOS (Environmental COntaminant Sensor). The heart of the sensor is an E. coli culture that has been modified to produce GFP when exposed to xylene. Xylene was chosen as a trigger because its presence is well correlated with the presence of the more dangerous benzene/benzene derivatives which are carcinogenic. The XylR transcriptional activator is a protein which in the presence of m-xylene will bind to the Pu promoter resulting in the expression of green fluorescent protein.

When two different strains are inoculated and mixed on the same agar plate, an inducer coded by the losing strain will contact the winning strains promoter, causing the victor strain's expression of fluorescent protein. The victor will be visually identifiable because of its specific fluorescent protein. Our design is dependent on successful extracellular signaling by the inducers' hydrophobic behavior; only a hydrophobic inducer will be able to travel across cells.

Parathion is a typical representative of organophosphorus pesticides.

Besides, we try constructing a degradation system to solve the pollution problem. Considering the biosafety problem, we also design a suicide system in which the lethal genes are only triggered by declining p-Nitrophenol concentration. This will enable the bacteria to commit suicide when p-Nitrophnol is sufficiently degraded.
https://teams.igem.org/1011	Foundational Advance	Overexpression of the tubulin-homolog FtsZ leads to asymmetric cell division in E. coli that yields achromosomal "minicells." The lack of a chromosome renders minicells unable to replicate and cause infection, yet they still retain and express plasmid genes. Furthermore, minicells inherit the stable, non-leaky membranes and cytosolic composition from their parent cell. Our project design is centered on the creation of an IPTG-inducible FtsZ Biobrick that permits tunable overexpression for optimal minicell production. With the development of a multi-purpose, innocuous bacterial chassis as our ultimate goal, we incorporated three additional safety elements: the Ail protein, a polysialic acid capsule and de-acylated lipopolysaccharide. Both Ail and the PSA capsule serve to prevent complement deposition on the surface of the minicells, with PSA also protecting against antibody opsonization. Finally, LPS toxicity is reduced by inducing minicell formation in an lpxM mutant strain that lacks a critical myristoyl transferase for late-stage acyl modifications.
https://teams.igem.org/1012	Environment	<b>The ToxiMop project</b> attempts to tackle the problem of freshwater algal blooms by detecting, reducing, and reporting the levels of the algal toxin microcystin. This toxin causes liver damage and is also speculated to be a carcinogen. Microcystins toxic action lies in its ability to bind to the human Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1), which is a major regulator of cell division, protein synthesis and other essential processes. Using synthetic biology techniques, we engineered bacterial chassis (<i>E. coli</i> and <i>B. subtilis</i>) to express PP1, which covalently binds to microcystin. The engineered bacteria can then be used as a molecular mop, the ToxiMop, to remove microcystin from contaminated water. Applying mathematical modelling to our experiments, we optimised our prototype ToxiMop. Additionally, we attempted to develop a biological detector for microcystin, which was combined with our electronic device, the Moptopus. This device has the potential for real-time monitoring and analysis of water bodies.

https://teams.igem.org/1014	Foundational Advance	The composition of B-POM is that hrpR's promoter depends on the input, but hrpSpromoter is always Ptet and tet owns PhrpL, while the output gene follows tet and shares PhrpL. Once the input is sensed, the input promoter triggers hrpR's transcription. The activity of Ptet is constitutive, which means HrpS protein is ample. As HrpR accumulates, HrpS binds to HrpR and form HrpRS which then triggers PhrpL, and tetR and output begin to accumulate. tetR can inhibit Ptet. As a feedback, HrpS and HrpRS will decrease. PhrpL will be of lower activity, so the amount of tetR and the level of output will decline. The decrease of tetR will enhance the hrpS' expression. All these construct a feedback cycle. Finally, the output will stabilize and be in a certain proportion with the input. By manipulating the RBS of hrpR, hrpS, tetR and output gene, we can control input-output proportion.

We are constructing and characterizing E. coli strains with targeted deletions or recombinant protein expressions that are crucial in biofilm formation pathways. In response to environmental stimuli such as temperature, blue light, or sodium, the phenotype of each mutant E. coli strain will be characterized using a specially developed high-throughput protocol. Biofilm formation control has applications for bioremediation, in which we are pursuing in a related project on heavy metal precipitation.

We constructed and characterized a device named Alk-Sensor, which can sensitively detect a wide range of alkanes and generate certain response. Alk-Sensor is composed of ALKR proteina transcriptional regulatory protein, and promoter alkM. ALKR recognizes alkanes and their interaction triggered a conformation change of ALKR dimers which isomerizes the promoter-RNAP complex and led to activate the downstream genes of PalkM.<br><br> Based on Alk-Sensor, we built a relationship between productivity of alkanes with strains growth rate under certain environmental stress. Starting from this relationship we further designed a novel selection method to select out the engineered strains with highest productivity of alkanes.

We were inspired to do so by a local company, Ecovative Design, that uses lignin-degrading fungi and plant matter to produce a biodegradable Styrofoam substitute. The existing product that we are seeking to improve, known as mushroom packaging, is a sustainable and necessary alternative to Styrofoam. Polystyrene can take hundreds of years to degrade in landfills, produces dozens of identified chemical toxins upon combustion, and is tremendously inefficient to recycle, thus posing difficulties for disposal and polluting the environment. However, the production efficiency of Ecovatives substitute suffers due to contamination from pathogenic molds, a problem that we seek to solve using synthetic biology. Using the complex, plant-pathogenic basidiomycete, <i>Ganoderma lucidum</i>, as a chassis, we are expanding the accessibility of fungal genetic engineering and demonstrating its utility for commercial purposes.

Of the alternative treatments currently under investigation one of the more promising is through antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). These small, highly-specific peptides attack the membrane of target organisms. Thousands of AMPs are known to exist and little resistance against them has been developed. The Peptidor project consists of an <i>E. coli</i> that can detect <i>S. aureus</i>, using <i>S. aureus</i> native quorum sensing system, in order to locally produce and deliver AMPs. Upon detection, peptides inactivated by a SUMO-tag fusion, are overexpressed. After a delay period, introduced through a negative transcriptional cascade, a SUMO protease is expressed cleaving off the inactivating tag. Using this mechanism, high concentrations of peptide are delivered at the infection to efficiently kill <i>S. aureus</i>. As a safety mechanism, the timer also activates an <i>E. coli</i> kill-switch.

https://teams.igem.org/1028	Health & Medicine	Micro-Beagle is a novel reporter system for E-coli that, as an iGEM first, has been designed to dynamically detect arbitrary target solids (including other cells) through a mechanism activated by cell surface binding. Micro-Beagle is a modular system, utilising Ice Nucleation Protein to express and position target-binding peptides on the cell surface. Target binding induces membrane stress that activates the Cpx signalling pathway, and Micro-Beagle thus utilises a promoter from this pathway (pCpxR) to initiate expression of a reporter protein, such as GFP. As a proof of concept, we have used silica beads as a model diagnostic target (a pathogen surrogate) and the silica-binding Si4 sequence as the target-binding peptide. We foresee Micro-Beagle being adapted for both the detection of waterborne pathogens and a variety of other diagnostic applications, and we envision future multisensor Micro-Beagles in which diverse pathogens can be simultaneously and quantitatively measured from a single water sample.
https://teams.igem.org/1029	Environment	Detrimental alterations caused to water bodies by endocrine disruptive chemicals are an increasing problem in our environment. Especially steroid hormones influence the development and generative behavior of fish. The binding of those hormones to progestogen receptors can mistime the reproductive behavior of aquatic organisms and thereby endanger population balance. Our aim is to construct a yeast-based measurement system for progestin concentration in water samples. Many currently used methods are either very expensive or significantly slower than our method will be. We take advantage of membrane bound receptors in order to achieve high specificity and to speed up measurement. The binding of the ligand to the receptor stops inhibition of the reporter and thereby initiates its expression through a sensitive signaling-chain. This transcriptional switch allows measurement of very small amounts of substrate. To improve our system we use different interchangeable parts for assembly to get a high variety of possible applications.
https://teams.igem.org/1030	Information Processing	There are many applications of the game theory in some aspects of our life. Each individual has two kinds of choices--to betray or stay silent, and the choice you make would determine your fate. To betray the other side, you may risk being revenged. While staying silent, companion's betrayal may hurt you deeply. As for our project, we work out a new way to imitate the game theory by constructing a community of two E. Coli bacteria. Here we use the growth rate of each species to represent its fate. The effect of one's silent or betrayal on the other species' fate is acted through intercellular signal molecules of two quorum sensing systems. Each signal molecule regulates the expression of toxic genes in the other species and reduces its growth rate. We characterize the consequence of each strategy by quantitatively measure the growth rates of each species in the community.
https://teams.igem.org/1031	Environment	Aromatic pollution is becoming a worldwide concern, and monitoring aromatics remains challenging. Noting the abundant genomic data of prokaryotes from aromatics-rich environment, Peking iGEM applied part mining to the genetic repertoire to develop a comprehensive set of biosensors for aromatics. The transcriptional regulators for each typical class of aromatic compounds were bioinformatically determined and promoter engineering and protein engineering were performed to tune their function. To expand the detection range, enzymes in upper pathways, working as plug-ins, were coupled with biosensors to degrade aromatics to detectable compounds. For environmental detection, we construct the band pass filter to detect a certain range of concentration. Responses of biosensors equipped with band-pass filter can robustly reflect the concentration of environmental samples. Peking iGEM has remarkably enriched the library of biosensors for aromatics and enabled quantitative detection for environmental monitoring. These biosensors will be also potent for metabolic engineering and well-characterized synthetic biological tools.
https://teams.igem.org/1032	Software Tools	To standardize genetic circuits and bring the idea that relations exist in circuit between parts back to synthetic biology, we proposed our Technical Standard RFC 101 and RFC 102 to define genetic circuits and logical gene gates. To solve the problem that synthetic biology lacks such a database to systematically record genetic circuits and to make the standards work, we built Circuit+, an online registry of standard genetic circuit which records information of circuits based on the two standards. Users can retrieve circuits, browse information, share by exporting SBOL and upload new circuits. We also have developed Clotho version Circuit+, Circuit List and transplanted TTEC to Clotho. And we have developed an online platform for synthetic biology lab management. We also did human practice to promote synthetic biology and iGEM.

Even if you get the right amount of calories, if these do not contain sufficient amounts of micronutrients, like vitamins and minerals, serious illness and even death can be the result. The goal of our project is to alleviate this problem by applying synthetic biology to probiotic bacteria. With our project, we will make the lactobacillus genus the new probiotic platform for metabolic engineering of nutritional compounds. We will engineer probiotics to produce for example beta-carotene, resveratrol, p-coumaric acid, miraculin and saffron. To exemplify what this combination of probiotics and metabolic engineering can accomplish we used our modified bacteria to create nutritionally enriched yoghurt. We have also put great effort into addressing the ethical and safety issues that naturally follow when creating GM food.

https://teams.igem.org/1036	Foundational Advance	Oscillations permeate every corner of the world, from the alternative current &#65288;AC&#65289; in power lines to our tiny microorganism friends. To use oscillations in bacteria as a strong and steady signal transmission method like AC, we need to tackle with the noise of transcription and translation in the cellular environment by coupling millions of cells through the synchronizing genetic oscillations in E.coli. At the colony level cells could be synchronized via quorum sensing, which is limited to tens of micrometers by the AHL, and between colonies a gas-phase redox (mainly H2O2) will serve as a signal that can give positive feedback to the whole circuit over millimeter scales simultaneously. On a liquid crystal display (LCD)-like microfluidic array bacteria grow in separate colonies, so that synchronization in both levels could be verified visually. Now a robust synthetic biology signal converter is accomplished and ready to show the growth environment of cells.
https://teams.igem.org/1037	Health & Medicine	Hypertension causes grave concern worldwide for its notoriety, therere not many therapeutic methods to hypertension besides various antihypertensive drugs. However, this comes along with heavy financial burden to developing or underdeveloped countries. In addition, almost all these drugs have side effects to liver and renal. Here is a novel method to treat Hypertension by constructing human-friendly engineering bacteria that can produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) periodically and naturally to help maintain the blood pressure in safe level. SCFA, especially acetate and propionate, has been proved to induce vasodilatation and ensuing hypotensive response via receptors in smooth muscle cells of vessels. This year we have found a metabolic pathway in Escherichia coli that converts succinate to propionate through Wood-Werkman reaction. An operon consisting four genes encodes enzymes in this pathway. By combining bio-oscillator and key gene together, we want to make E. Coli release propionate periodically in patients intestine periodically.
https://teams.igem.org/1038	Food & Energy	The aim of our project was to construct a biological system that would be able to detect methanol in ethanol solutions. Our idea was to create a test that could be performed not only in the laboratory, but also at home. We believe that such test would reduce the rate of intoxications by methanol during ethanol consumption. To achieve it, we used a methanol-dependent promoter from Methylobacterium organophilum which would control the production of a dye, for instance GFP, or an enzyme that would produce visible product, such as catechol oxidase. Our eventual goal is to find a bacterium that would not only react to methanol, but also survive in high concentrations of ethanol.
https://teams.igem.org/1039	Foundational Advance	In nature, intercellular communication allows coordinated cellular behavior on a population level. Engineers seeking complex programmed population-level behavior require tools enabling controlled, information-rich intercellular messaging. Given its versatility and universality as an information-encoding molecule, DNA suggests itself as a message-carrying molecule to enable information-rich messaging. The Endy group at Stanford recently published a proof-of-principle demonstration of such DNA messaging wherein a DNA message was transmitted from one bacterial population to another carried by M13 bacteriophage particles. Here we propose an intercellular communication program that extends DNA messaging by controlling modification and transmission of a DNA message. Modification is controlled through flipping a DNA switch on the message DNA  a promoter sequence that is invertible using serine integrases and recombination directionality factors (RDFs). Transmission is controlled by placing expression of the M13 major coat protein, which is required for viral packaging of message DNA, under control of such a switch.
https://teams.igem.org/1040	Information Processing	Since the middle of the 20th century, Escherichia coli(E.coli) have made great contributions to various field of our society. Although they have played essential roles in the society, it seems that they are not properly appreciated by general public. People's common images to E.coli are very negative (dirty, stinky, dangerous etc). So in our project, to wipe away the negative images to E.coli, we have created a circle that enable them to communicate with each other via nutrient production.And we made empathetic E.coli that lives cooperatively with each other. Then, by conducting experiments and using computer simulation, we have examined how they live and grow in liquid medium culture and what kind of pattern they form on solid medium culture.
https://teams.igem.org/1041	Health & Medicine	Antimycins, anti-fungal compounds primarily produced by Streptomyces (a sub-set of actinomycetes), function by inhibiting the final stage of the electron transport chain. Our aim is to develop Biosensors to aid identification of novel antimycin-producing actinomycetes. Homologues of the AntA sigma factor, the key regulatory protein in antimycin biosynthesis, are present in all 14 known biosynthetic gene clusters. Due to this property, Biosensors have been designed with the AntA-regulated promoter (antGp) controlling the expression of three reporters: neomycin resistance gene, RFP (red fluorescent protein) and GUS (providing &#946;-glucoronidase activity). The Biosensors will be produced, trialled and optimised where possible after sub-cloning into two actinomycete-specific integrative plasmids, pMS82 (&#966;BT1 integrase) and pAU3-45 (&#966;C31 integrase). Worldwide soil and sediment samples have been collected to produce a library of actinomycete strains, which will be screened using our Biosensors, the ultimate goal being to screen bacterial strains for antimycin production.
https://teams.igem.org/1042	Village	Heavy metal contaminants pose a serious health threat around the world, especially in locations with poor irrigation. Cadmium, in particular, is a known carcinogen that affects the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and respiratory systems. The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry compiled a Priority List of toxic substances, on which Cadmium was seventh. We combined the Green Fluorescent Protein coding region with a Cadmium Sensitive Promoter to create our detector, which provides a simple and inexpensive test for the presence of Cadmium in water supplies. We will incorporate sensitivity tuners to decrease the detection threshold, and we will use mutagenic PCR on both the promoter and the entire detector to increase its sensitivity. Proper use of this BioBrick could result in early detection of cadmium polluted water and potentially prevent deaths worldwide.
https://teams.igem.org/1043	Manufacturing	Plants as Plants: Natural Factories provides a green approach to the manufacturing of valuable chemicals and materials. Through synthetic biology, we are able to control the expression of genes that regulate the production of desired secondary metabolites. Via the manipulation of established metabolic pathways, we hope to produce vanillin and butanol. The prospect of being able to synthetically produce a biofuel provides vast possibilities for the scope of synthetic biology and green energy. Additionally through the manipulation of the cellulose synthase genes, we hope to increase the biomass of plants by a hybrid plant cell wall. As shown through these projects, the use of plants provides various green energy possibilities. However, due to the limited use of plants within synthetic biology there are various regulation issues. Thus we have additionally worked on characterizing a range of plant promoters as well as introducing the Cas9 crisper system into plants.

For this we developed the different parts to insert into the system of agrobacterium. Among them are the genes used for expression of the curdlan. Similarly, genetic parts in order to increase the expression of the cellulose, along with the agrobacterium type binary vector were also developed . We are also working on recycling the produced paper by degrading the cellulose to D-Glucose using various enzymes. We worked for the preparation of the biological ink using the sperm whale's cells by genetically modification to increase amount of myoglobin. Then, we observed the change on the color of the product by altering the formation of myoglobin and the production amount of myoglobin with the insertion of T7 promoter to the cell system.

However, after 90 years, the antibiotics are now losing their old time glory: Bacteria acquire resistance against antibiotics and become unbridled. We must control the use of antibiotics, meanwhile, we need new antibiotics, which can suffiently eliminate the invaders without hurting the "good" bacteria. Therefore, c-di-AMP, an important, recently discovered signaling molecule in gram-positive bacteria, has come to our sight. Our project is to build a screening system targeting c-di-AMP, which could be applied in novel-drug screening. With this system, the level of c-di-AMP in the cell can be visualised and measured.

Positive results are reported with red fluorescent protein for easy identification which can be done with high throughput methods such as 96 well plates and flow cytometry. We test our platform on sensors with interesting known responses. The chimera proteins are also useful in creating signals orthogonal to the cell.

We also tried to develop a way to eliminate bad smells of E. coli in parallel. Although we previously won a gold prize by the development of a novel pen (E. coli Pen) in 2010, its bad smells were weak points and must be improved. We will overcome this problem through the progress of our new project in 2013. So far, smell is not a popular keyword and not a major field in iGEM.

https://teams.igem.org/1053	New Application	We created Twinkle.coli, which blinks fast&#12288;like a firefly. An oscillator is a system that responds in periodic changes. This response is usually regulated by positive or negative feedbacks by using inducer or repressor proteins. However, the use of proteins might delay the response because transcription and translation must happen before the next output. To design an artificial fast responding oscillating circuit, we designed an&#12288;RNA-based oscillator. We used RNA-responsive self-cleavage ribozymes whose cleavage is regulated by an RNA molecule. The ribozyme cleavage cuts-off an RNA scaffold that harbors RNA aptamers. This aptamer binds to its specific target proteins, which are directly fused to reporter protein. This binding recruits the already translated split reporter protein complementation resulting in the output (twinkles).&#12288;Our system enabled fast response and short oscillation cycle.
https://teams.igem.org/1054	New Application	This year we aim to utilize aptamer to specifically detect and clear molecules of different sizes. In order to detect and clear certain protein, we make tunneled <i>E.coli</i> called bacterial ghost that allow protein to diffuse in. We then build two types of inner-membrane protein scaffold, which will dimerize when pulled together by two aptamers attached to two sites of the protein. The dimerized proteins have enzymatic activity that can be detected via commercial test strips. The device will also sequester the proteins and allow us to clear them. In order to efficiently detect and clear a small molecule called atrazine, which is an herbicide causing tremendous environmental problems, we split our aptamer-based detection module and clear module into two strains. The first strain is chemotaxic to atrazine and will release quorum sensing molecules to attract the second strain, which contains atrazine hydrolase to clear it.

Undetected contaminations can render large quantities of food stocks useless  with detrimental effects on the economy and the food supply. We want to develop a handy device which allows an easy, fast and reliable detection of mycotoxins. For that our team uses various methods from the fields of synthetic biology, electrical engineering and information processing. Our system relies on E. coli with modified TAR receptor interacting with specific mycotoxins. If these are present in the sample they induce a conformational change of TAR and thereby generates a measurable FRET-beacon by bringing two fluorophores in close distance to each other. The modified E. coli will be embedded in exchangeable capsules. Together with a handheld-device and a controlling Smartphone App they will guarantee that measurements can be done quickly, easy to operate and secure.

Our goal is to purify these enzymes in the lab, and use our purified enzymes to make a Gibson reaction master mix with efficacy equal to those sold commercially. Hexahistidine-tagged T5 Exonuclease and Taq Ligase genes were synthesized and cloned into <i>Escherichia coli</i>. These strains were used to produce large quantities of all three enzymes which could then be purified using Ni-NTA columns in a cost-effective manner. We then combined appropriate quantities of the three enzymes and designed an assay to determine the efficacy of the "homemade" Gibson master mix. We hope that our protocol could be used by teams who lack sufficient funds to buy costly Gibson enzymes to make their own for a fraction of the price.
https://teams.igem.org/1057	New Application	In nature, there exist a variety of magnetotactic bacteria. Recently, it was reported that non-magnetotactic cells such as yeast can be magnetized to some extent. We set the goal to transform E. coli into those that are attracted by magnets. By magnetizing E. coli, the cell harvesting process will be much simpler and more economical than the conventional processes such as centrifugation and filtration. To this end, we are conducting three itemized projects. (1) modification of iron transportation network to import as much Fe ions as possible in E. coli, (2) sequestering/ storing iron into human ferritin, and (3) converting cytosolic space from reducing to oxidizing in order to elevate Fe(II)/ Fe(III) ratio within. Because all such manipulations significantly impact the physiology of the host cell, we are establishing the BioBrick platform that enables the temporal knockdown of multiple genes using recently control technology such as CRISPRi.

In a synthetic biological way, 2013 BIT iGEM assembled the T7 RNA polymerase gene and T7 promoter as an amplification block (amplifier), which is based on the high activity of T7 promoter to amplify the signal. To make the magnification controllable, a lacO operator regulated by lacI was assembled in downstream as a control block (controller), by adjusting the concentration of IPTG. With this block, several sensors of materials including but not limited to antibiotics are able to be enhanced controllable. This year, a sensor of beta-lactam newly designed and one of tetracycline are applied to detect the residual of antibiotics in milk which endangers human health. To make the detection faster and more convenient, milk samples and engineered E.coli are mixed in a tailor-made bio-chip and the green fluorescence will be detected and shown on a tailor-made electronic equipment.

Not only physical damage to the crops caused by the sucking is a problem, but aphids also transmit harmful viruses to the plants. The magnitude of loss is difficult to quantify as it changes with aphid species, crop species, location, year and other factors. The use of insecticides to control aphid population is contested, as it has a negative effect on the natural predators and aphids grow resistant. That's why we, the KU Leuven iGEM 2013 team, decided to do something about it in a sustainable way, using an insecticide-free controlling mechanism. With E.coligy: Plants with BanAphids we will teach E.coli cells to hack into insects signaling systems to drive off the aphids and attract the natural predators, such as the ladybug.

However, Further application of human induced pluripotent stem cells(hiPSCs) in tranlational medicine requires the concerns of two problems: the specificity of directional differentiation and the safety of the transplant. Here we design a new device which can spontaneously select hepatocytes from iPS differentiated cell mass and prevent potential carcinogenesis.To achieve accurate spatiotemporal control,we build a miRNA-122 sensor and make use of the tetracycline induction system.Our work may also be extended to the field of gene therapy, and provide a new direction to our train of thought about how to solve the safety problem in genetic manipulation of human cells.

The goal of our project is to take advantage of a natural horizontal gene transfer mechanism in bacteria to precisely affect gene expression in selected strains. We combine bacterial conjugation with CRISPRi, an RNAi-like repression system developed from bacteria, to regulate gene expression in targeted strains within a complex microbial community. One possible application is to selectively repress pathogenic genes in a microbiome, leaving the community makeup unaffected. In addition, we use CRISPRi to lay the groundwork for transferring large circuits that enable complex functionality and decision-making in cells.

The biosensor uses Escherichia coli as the chassis to build a genetic circuit using SOS response system to detect DNA damage caused by aflatoxin B1-oxide attack. The SOS response promoter is followed by a reporter gene coding a chromoprotein, therefore the concentration of aflatoxin B1 in food samples could be easily detected by the color change of the bacteria. For the ease of usage, we will design a syringe shaped device with our whole cell biosensor in it.

The system works by synthesising ethylene or methyl salicylate (MeSA) upon photoinduction. Everything is housed in a vending machine-like enclosure that regulates fruit ripening in response to consumer demand. Ethylene is a natural plant hormone that is widely used to ripen fruit, such as bananas and kiwi. However, the synthesis, handling, and storage of ethylene is expensive and dangerous. In contrast, B. fruity produces ethylene from inexpensive material by exploiting a TCA cycle intermediate, 2-oxoglutarate, and the activity of <i>P. syringae</i> 2-oxoglutarate decarboxylase. The inhibition of fruit ripening results from the synthesis of MeSA via a pathway built with wintergreen parts.

In the presence of abundant ammonia, algae overgrow and consume much of the available oxygen in the water. This results in decreased biodiversity throughout the watershed. Within Europe, 53% of lakes are eutrophic. Using two E. coli mutants built with genes from Nitrosomonas europaea and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we provide a system to reverse nitrogen fixation.

Recently, the sunlight-driven microalgae Phaeodactylum tricornutum has been established as an elegant tool for the production of proteins. A major - however yet unchallenged - advantage of this system is the production of advanced proteins with specific posttranslational modifications and the ability of their direct secretion into the medium allowing easy purification with low effort and costs.

Also, a self-regulating bacterial culture with intra consortial dependencies offers great advances in biosafety. To shut down the whole bacterial consortium, only on strain has to be eliminated. We engineer three different E. coli strains to grow in a consortium exploiting different Quorum Sensing systems. Each strain maintains a constitutive expression of an inactive transcription activator (LuxR, LasR or RhlR). Inducers are synthesized by different synthases (LuxI, LasI or RhlI) that are each expressed in one strain and subsequently secreted into the medium. Once taken up by a cell, the inducers bind to the corresponding, inactive transcription factors to render them functional. As a result, an antibiotic resistance under the control of an inducible promoter is expressed.

From now on, injections are simply history.Based on the theory of user-friendly, a special group of engineering bacteria which produce T-VACCINE is used to create a brand-new "band-aid" serving as a guardian of our health .We have found a kind of transdermal peptide TD-1,a magical molecule that enhances the permeability of the skin as well as draw filamentous bacteriophages into the skin.By combining the gene fragments of antigen,immune adjuvant LTB and Luman-recruiting factor TNLF&#945; with that of the TD-1, our team got the permeable fusion protein. In order to obtain large amount of extracelluar protein, we chose bacillus subtilis WB800N as our expression chassis. Further more, the universality of our experimental method is verified by the adoption of various antigen of existing vaccine, such as HBsAg, PA and AG85B.
https://teams.igem.org/1075	Foundational Advance	A reliable, yet easily adaptable mechanism for controlling protein activity is key to most areas of life and medical science research. Still, the most common approaches suffer from various flaws. iGEM Bonn 2013 aims to overcome these drawbacks by engineering a novel tool based on <i>blue light-inducible degradation of targeted proteins</i>.</br> The use of a modified ClpXP protease system allows a significant increase in rate and scale of activity change while keeping the modification of the target protein to a minimum. Combining this system with a tool for photo-activatable heterodimerisation based on a LOV domain results in a superior tempero-spatial control.</br> To demonstrate the capabilities of our device, we designed a <i>photosensitive kill-switch</i>. This contributes to the security of synthetic biology in such a way that bacteria accidentally brought out of a safe work environment, for example a red-light-hood, would be killed by sunlight within a short period of time.

The fat acid degradation via Beta-oxidation is done by enzymes which expression is regulated by the genes FadR, FadL, FadD, FadE producing acetyl CoA. All these features are remarkable for bioremediation of fat and oil spills.Besides that,is also known for its ability in delivering electrons to external media.we modified Shewie &#946;-oxidation pathway silencing regulators and enhancing expression of some genes for fat degradation.In this years' project we aim to make a micro power plant using a bacteria hungry for used-frying-oil.
https://teams.igem.org/1077	Foundational Advance	Recent studies have just started to explore the possibility of utilizing existing recombination systems, to store information and perform computations. However, the only systems studied so far are not completely unidirectonal in their ability to flip a segment of DNA. Instead, previous systems have relied on recombination directionality factors, which when complexed with the unidirectional recombinase, reverse the direction in which it flips the DNA segment. The fim system from E. coli, has been shown to contain 2 unidirectional recombinases, hbif and fime, which flip a promoter containing segment of DNA. Our project seeks to engineer the fim switch by replacing the native promoter with another promoter. We demonstrate that it can function as a reliable and efficient biological transistor, or transcriptor. Beyond storing information and performing basic computations, the system would serve as a very useful, tightly controlled switch.
https://teams.igem.org/1078	Manufacturing	Our product is a bioengineered sensor, which will be able to detect levels of methanol above 2% in common alcoholic drinks. This will allow government to make high-throughput screening of ethanol drinks tainted will methanol. The device will be used as an initial low cost and portable test. The construction is based on the pAOX promoter, which is activated by methanol and repressed by ethanol. Several parts of the device must be tuned for proper function in Pichia pastoris; pAOX promoter, red fluorescent protein (RFP), Mxr1p transcriptional factor and FLD promoter. Since we aim to develop a product ready for the consumer to use, we plan to develop a plastic container for the lyophilized yeast, printed by 3D printer, that will help perform the test and will also contain the yeast. After use, the container will be able to apply bleach to eliminate the yeast.
https://teams.igem.org/1079	Software Tools	Synthetic biology creates and uses standardized parts such as Biobricks to build engineered bacteria for various function. To realize those purposes, importing exogenous genes to target bacteria is universal and essential. In this approach, improve or reduce the expression of target genes through interaction is inevitable. Experiments in wet lab could find the effect and choose the best of imported exogenous genes but take a long period of time. gNap utilizes Internet databases to construct a genetic regulatory network (GRN) and analyze the effect of exogenous gene by Michaelis-Menten equation and sequence alignment algorithm. Meanwhile, to guide wet lab experimenters to find the best imported gene in the whole GRN, we use PSO method to figure out the best regulation patterns of new imported genes meeting experimenters goal. To realize those ideas, we build gNAP that provides researchers with gene network analysis and prediction.
https://teams.igem.org/1080	Village	Photosynthesis is a key biological pathway that uses sunlight energy to convert water and carbon dioxide into ATP, glucose and oxygen. Chlorophyll is a green pigment that facilitates this energy production in photosynthetic organisms. Although the biosynthesis pathway for chlorophyll has been thoroughly investigated, the reproduction of this pathway in a non-photosynthetic organism has, to date, not been achieved. Successful production of chlorophyll in a bacterial host is the first step towards the synthetic construction of photosystem II, and the eventual creation of a renewable energy source. Our research involves expression of twelve genes (from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii) necessary for the chlorophyll biosynthesis pathway in a bacterial host (E. coli). Gene sequences have been synthetically designed to allow for prokaryotic expression. By utilising Gibson assembly, we plan on being able to successfully produce chlorophyll in prokaryotic cells. This will be evident from the growth of green E. coli colonies.
https://teams.igem.org/1081	New Application	Cas9 is an RNA-guided dsDNA nuclease utilized by bacteria immune system. The genetically engineered Cas9 has recently been shown to have the ability to repress or activate desired gene expression. </p> In practical research and industrial application, we usually face the problem to express a gene at different levels, not only on or off , so a more flexible regulation method is needed. To achieve multi-stage regulation of target genes, we further develop several dCas9 devices in which dCas9 alone or fused with omega subunit of RNAP is directed by various guide RNAs to different regions of designed double promoters. Therefore, promoters with disparate strength can be either activated or repressed respectively and multi-stage gene expression can be achieved. Also, based on such novel technology platform, we are developing diverse applications such as a guide RNA-mediated oscillator.
https://teams.igem.org/1082	Health & Medicine	Gram negative bacteria produce outer membrane vesicles (OMV) in the size range of 20-200nm. Whereas their function and contents has been studied for decades, their potential as drug carriers has not been investigated before. We want to introduce protein G from <i>Streptococcus dysgalactiae</i> subsp. equisimilis into <i>Escherichia coli</i> OMV's. Protein G is known to bind to human serum albumin (HSA) which helps <i>S. dysgalactiae</i> subsp. equisimilis hide from the immune system. <br><br> The second part of our project is to introduce fluorescent proteins (FP's) linked together into the vesicles. Introducing protein G and linked FP's into the vesicles will demonstrate that it is indeed possible to manipulate the content, and therefore the properties, of OMV's.
https://teams.igem.org/1083	Village	Antibodies are usefull for recognition of antigens in food. Antibodies have, however, a very complex structure that is not suitable for expression in E. Coli. The Camelid antibody IgG (cIgG), however, has lower complexity than the Human IgG. We present a new approach for recognition of food allergens with a synthetizised cIgG for expression in E. Coli. The epitope of cIgG is designed for Hen Egg White Lysosyme (HEWL). The cIgG is designed with a linker that connects to the bioluminescent enzyme Luciferase. We also synthetizised an HEWL antigen carrying the protein RFP, A-HRFP, that reacts to the luminescence of luciferase as the A-HRFP attaches to the cIgG. The recognition of HEWL in a sample leads to the release of luminescent green-light as a result of HEWL binding to the cIgG. If, however, no HEWL antigen is present in the sample, A-HRFP binds to cIgG resulting in a luminescent red-shift.
https://teams.igem.org/1084	Village	Thousands of genes are expressed in living cells. Their expression is cleverly controlled by promoters and RBSs. Precise regulation of recombinant genes is hard to achieve. Imbalance in regulation results in little production. However, it is hard to objectively select promoters and RBSs. We thought that E. coli could do the selection for us. We created a kit for E. coli to find the best suited promoters and RBSs. It enables our lab E. coli to be like Maestro who creates excellent harmonies with lots of instruments. For the kit we created an original promoter and RBS families with different strengths. We checked and made these parts to be reliable. And it only takes a single golden-gate assembly to get your construct! We made the promoters and RBSs by selecting from randomized libraries. Using the kit, E. coli can choose optimal promoters and RBSs by her/it/him-self, just like the maestro.
https://teams.igem.org/1085	Health & Medicine	Approximately half of all implanted medical devices result in one or more medical complication, which have been found to increase mortality rates by 25%, and to cost the amerian society an additional 30 billion dollars every year. A possible solution for these complications is to form a protective biocompatible layer between the implant and the body by means of a spider silk coating. This is achieved through mathematical modelling, techniques from the synthetic biology, and the Gram-positive bacteria <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>, which is redesigned to secrete silk and to self-assemble into a biofilm surrounding the implant. It uses a modified chemotaxis system coupled to the DesK heat sensing system to do so. <i>B. subtilis</i> is furthermore often used in the industry for the commercial production of extracellular proteins, and is generally regarded as safe.
https://teams.igem.org/1086	Health & Medicine	Death by heart diseases is very common worldwide, being Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) its main cause. This fact is deeply related to late diagnosis, which is usually made after the cardiac event had already occurred. We, from UFMG team, decided to explore this problem building a system capable of providing a precocious diagnosis for ACS based in 3 biomarkers: Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP), Trimethylamine-N-Oxide (TMAO) and Ischemia Modified Albumin (IMA). The main goal is to detect each of these biomarkers using our engineered E. coli by integrating the signals CFP, YFP and RFP produced when BNP, IMA and TMAO, respectively, are present in a sample of patient serum. This diagnosis is based on color intensity of the fluorescent proteins. So, we can establish the presence or absence and severity of ACS disease and predict earlier a myocardial event, thus providing information for fast treatment.

When cultured separately, the male/female multicellular system gets bigger and matures, and cells will differentiate into gametes,which cannot divide any more but are capable of gene transfer.</p> <p>After that, you mix this two liquid cultures,the male gametes will recognize the female cells and begin to transfer modified F plasmids into female gametes through sex pili. The conjugation makes female gametes return to the state of un-differentiation(called G cells),which means they can divide again but are not sexually determined.Then,after several cell divisions,one G cell will differentiate into a G+ or G-,which, like zygote, can grow into next generation of the multicellular system maybe containing genes from both male and female gametes.</p>
https://teams.igem.org/1088	Manufacturing	The growing demand for natural rubber causes deforestation of the rainforest or occupation of arable lands, all due to the founding of new plantations. If producing rubber by bacteria succeeds, production of natural rubber will not be limited to the regions where the rubber tree can grow. Our project aims to make an E. coli strain able to produce natural rubber while grown under controlled conditions. Natural rubber is composed of polymerized IPP (isopentenyl pyrophoshate) units. E. coli already possesses the ability to produce IPP, but it lacks the polymerization enzyme, prenyltransferase, from the rubber tree. In this project we introduce prenyltransferase into E. coli and simultaneously manipulate the bacteria to produce more of the IPP links, consequently leading to the production of natural rubber in the bacterial setting.
https://teams.igem.org/1090	Environment	Many regulatory agencies such as the Department of Agriculture and the Environmental Protection Agency have specific standards for pathogen concentrations in sample materials, including zero-tolerance for some foodborne pathogens. However, current detection methods for these disease-causing bacteria suffer from one or more of the following limitations: 1) requiring sample enrichment, 2) inability of low-level detection, 3) indiscrimination between viable and non-viable cells, 4) small sample volume capacity, 5) tedious procedures, and 6) high assay cost. Our Universal Self-Amplified (USA) Biosensor uses a genetically modified detection bacteria to solve many of the aforementioned issues. The engineered USA bacteria will recognize a target chemical produced by the pathogen of study, which will trigger a cascade of genes to both amplify the chemical signal and produce a visible alert to the pathogens presence. The USA pathogen detection mechanism strives for rapidity, economy, and simplicity.
https://teams.igem.org/1091	Software Tools	Nebula is a biological circuit design tool composed of Interactive Part & Automatic Part. We classified the parts released in 2013 and constructed a database for users to choose what they want. In the first part, you are free to link any parts that we have already classified together to meet your requirement. In the second part, once you determine the inducer and the product, our software will offer you the optimized circuit with the input and output that you designated. We use Analytic Hierarchy Process to score every part and edges (passage linking two parts) according to attributions including availability, usefulness, sample status, part status and sequencing. According to weight of edges, we regard the shortest passage between input and output as the optimum presented to users. You can also save the circuits made in Nebula in case you want to check or change it later.
https://teams.igem.org/1092	Village	To rapidly regulate biological process, we designed a novel transmembrane protein called Voltage Switch (VS), which is a fusion protein utilizing the voltage sensing domain from potassium ion channels. Triggered by change in potential across the cell membrane, VS can separate or bring targeting enzymes into proximity, thus allowing an instant control of enzymatic reaction. We also utilized VS to accelerate the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) degradation system  another highlight of our project. The metabolites of certain PAHs are mutagenic and carcinogenic. We codon-optimized laccase from Bacillus sp. HR03 and catechol 1,2-dioxygenase from Pseudomonas putida KT2440 for Escherichia coli, which when forming a cascade, PAH degradation into less toxic simple carboxylic acid would occur. Since quinones are intermediates in the degradation of PAHs, we also added quinone sensing and response repressor (QsrR) to control the degradation process.

This compound is present not only in biological laboratories but also in starch-based food products (fries, chips etc.). We aim to construct a bacterial strain that would serve as a detector of acrylic amide. This will be attempted in two ways: through the use of roGFP (redox sensitive GFP) fused with glutaredoxin 1 (the presence of acrylamide is known to affect the cellular gluthatione pool) and by expressing hemoglobin &#945;- and &#946;- subunits fused with split fluorophore (adducts formed by acrylamide on the N-terminal valine are known to affect interactions between subunits). We also constructed a BiFC toolbox in BioBrick standard. We sought to find out what was the effect of acrylamide on a variety of human cell lines and asses the toxicity of different concentrations of this compound.
https://teams.igem.org/1094	Village	Project Magneto is a biological system that allows us to find better ways to treat cancer, acts as a sustainable energy source or just enables us to visualize our environment in a new way. We created it using <b>magnetosomes</b>. Thanks to these specialized organelles <b>magnetotactic bacteria</b> are able to navigate in the earths magnetic field. The magnetosome is a nanomagnet which consists of a magnetic crystal housed inside a lipid membrane. Magnetosomes arrange together in chains and act as a compass needle thereby orienting the cell. They show various properties that give them an advantage over industrially synthesized nanomagnets. We demonstrate their usability by fusing fluorescent proteins to their membrane. Through this we open the way for using magnetosomes in various different applications where the fluorescent protein could be simply replaced by a drug for targeted cancer therapy, an ATP-synthase to create a biological dynamo or dye for magnetic paint.

For 2013 we are diversifying, to reduce polystyrenes various environmental impacts: <p><b>Recycling</b> - Building on 2012s project, we are adapting the toluene degradation pathway from <i>Pseudomonas</i> species to work on polystyrene, in <i>E. coli</i>.</p> <p><b>Re-using</b> - Consumer 3D printers use a variety of thermoplastics but virgin plastic is usually required. Recycled polystyrene can be a support for making complex 3D shapes, and removed later.

Currently this involves adding halogenated hydrocarbons, proven environmental pollutants. Recently DNA was shown to be an effective flame retardant, so we are using synthetic biology to generate cheap DNA, for flame retardant polystyrene.</p>

Pernicious anemia is a type of anemia occurs due to malabsorption of vitamin B12 in the small intestine due to problems with the production of Intrinsic Factor, which is responsible for the absorption of vitamine B12. Pernicious anemia shows its stiking effects on blood, gastro-intestinal tract and nervous system and pernicious anemia usually develops together with an autoimmune disease. Our aim as ITU MOBGAM IGEM Team, is to design a bacterium that is capable of surviving in small intestine and secreting Intrinsic Factor dependent on pH. Also, we design a genetic circuit for controlling the overgrowth and containment of bacteria.

Here we decide to invent an alcohol-detoxic beverage that can considerably prevent alcoholism by adding one healthy bacterium-lactobacillus. In principle, this engineered bacteria can survive in the extremely acidic stomach environment and reduce the toxicity by converting alcohol to corresponding carboxylic acid through a two-step reaction. The two-step reaction is catalyzed by intracellular alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH),respectively.We try to engineer both enzymes, ADH and ALDH, to be acid resistant for higher performance in human stomach.
https://teams.igem.org/1098	Health & Medicine	Canonical small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes are potent activators of the mammalian innate immune system. The induction of innate immunity by siRNA is dependent on siRNA structure and sequence, method of delivery, and cell type. The delivery of siRNA in a packaged outer membrane vesicle of gram negative bacteria is the theme of our work. The toll like receptor-7/8 activation by siRNA in order to boost the production of Interferon type -1 molecules to inhibit the viral and outer membrane LPS structure to activate Toll like receptor -4 to inhibit bacterial pathogens is the objective of this work. The delivery is made dependent on the peptide fragment which mediated the fusogenic mechanism so as to escape the endosomal compartment once endocytosed inside host(mamalian) cell. Thus freeing the siRNA to silence the myD88 transcript in host cytoplasm making RISC complex and hence, activating TLR-7/8 in endosomal membrane formerly.
https://teams.igem.org/1099	Village	Eucalyptol, the main component of Eucalyptus oil, is a valuable product with multiple potential industrial uses. Current methods are costly, which is a major deterrent for research on these applications. We have designed a system consisting of three strains of Escherichia coli (E. coli) which will convert spent grain waste from breweries into Eucalyptol. The design utilizes two strains of E. coli overexpressing and secreting enzymes to degrade hemicellulose into xylose. The third strain of E. coli will utilize the xylose and convert the molecule into Eucalyptol using the Mevalonate pathway. A scale-up model was developed to assess industrial feasibility. The cost of production would drop two-thirds, which would make industrial uses plausible. Future studies will be transforming our E. coli with the genes of interest and testing for production of Eucalyptol.
https://teams.igem.org/1100	WIKI	RNA regulation patterns, which have not been fully understood so far, is a research hotspot still deserving exploiting. A recently-discovered riboswitch ALeader updated our ideas by its delicate, 75nt-structure consisting of an aptamer, a recombination site, and even a bicistron motif. Inspired by this natural design, we proposed a series of novel strategies this summer, with dynamic rather than static perspectives. Guided by the theoretical study on functional multistable states and semi-static states of a riboswitch, and the kinetics involving impacts from other systems such as CRISPR, RNA polymerases, ribosomes, and degradation complex, the ALeader-based functional multi-phase and tricistron switches are designed. We also tried to regulate aptamers function by manipulating its working environment instead of itself, with SpinachALeader-based real-time monitors to avoid the signal distortion. Furthermore, to demonstrate the advantages of RNA biobricks, we constructed an antibiotic-detector with ALeader, optimized by a network with a RNA-OUT/IN translational regulatory system.

https://teams.igem.org/1104	Environment	To save bees from Nosema ceranae, the culprit of colony collapse disorder, we created Bee. coli. from E. coli K-12 MG1655, a bacterium residing natively in bees. Bee. coli is strategically designed to work as follows. First, it continuously secretes mannosidase to inhibit the sprouting of N. ceranae spores. Second, if the bee is infected, the fungus-killing-circuit with a positive feedback design will be turned on to wipe out N. ceranae. Third, if these designer weapons should fail to conquer N. ceranae, our designed bee-suicide-operon will be activated to kill the infected bee and save its companions. Fourth, a light-inducible lysis system is included to ensure our Bee. coli only lives inside of the bee. Fifth, we apply encapsulation as the way to send Bee. coli into the bee. Since the capsule will only dissolve in a bees gut, our Bee. coli will not spread to the environment.
https://teams.igem.org/1105	Foundational Advance	The main goal of industrial biotechnology is to increase the yield of biochemical products using microorganisms as production hosts. This includes engineering large synthetic pathways and improving their expression. Overexpression of genes has hitherto mainly been achieved by using high or medium copy plasmids. However, studies have demonstrated that plasmid-bearing cells lose their productivity fairly quickly as a result of genetic instability. Therefore a new method was developed for the overexpression of a gene of interest in the bacterial chromosome: Chemically Inducible Chromosomal evolution (CIChE). In this technique the chromosome is evolved to contain a higher number of gene copies by adding a chemical inducer. The original model for CIChE, however, results in bacterial strains containing a large number of antibiotic resistance genes. To make this valuable technique more widely applicable in the industry, we developed a model for chromosomal evolution based on a toxin-antitoxin system instead of antibiotic resistance.
https://teams.igem.org/1106	Environment	Our project is focused on developing a biosensor specific for certain water pollutants, with a modular and scalable approach. This approach would make it easy to adapt the response for the detection of different substances. In contrast to other iGEM biosensors, it does not rely on expensive equipment or qualified people to interpret the results. Being aware that most of the populations affected by consumption of contaminated groundwater dont have scientific or technical training, we intend the device to be cheap and easily distributed. We have designed it in a way that any user could easily determine the presence and level of the contaminant on drinking water, using image-based instructions. The project will focus on measuring a primary pollutant: arsenic. However, its modular and scalable design provides an easy way to measure various contaminants such as nitrate/nitrite among others.

The bacterium is found in warm water environments, particularly in artificial water supply systems such as air conditioning systems and cooling towers. The enfection occures by inhalation by small droplets of contaminated water. Our aim, as the team Baskent_Meds, is developing bacteria which can recognize Legionella pneumophila specifically at species level by legionella quorum sensing, and respond by producing anti-Legionella peptide which is produced by some Staphylococcus strains. Quarum means minimum. Legionella pneumophila should sense the minimum amount of cells around to colonize in the environment and express its virulence. So our modified E. coli may sense the presence of Legionella pneumophila in any contaminated surface and kill it.

The peptide, Mambalgin-1, has been shown to have comparable analgesic effects to morphine but does not induce the debilitating withdrawal affects. However, extracting this peptide is expensive and dangerous work. Using a cassette of standardized systems (the pGAPz&#945; expression vectors) in P. pastoris, we sought to produce high quantities of pure, functional proteins in a safe and cost effective manner.

The teams vision is to build a biosynthetic drug delivery concept. The key word of this project is adaptability. Our goal is to explore a way of using E.Coli as a highly modular carrier, opening the gate to several applications and alternatives in disease treatments. Using the principles of synthetic biology, we engineered a gelatinase secreting E.

The drug delivery system is built in three parts: 1) the nanoparticle binding and 2) the environment sensing that 3) triggers the gelatinase release of the engineered E.

Nematodes, such a C. elegans, are fast crawling organisms, but they have limited biotechnological applications. By combining the best from both organisms, we present the first artificial synthetic symbiosis with bacteria engineered to ride on worms, which concentrate in hotspots where bacteria perform a desired biotechnological process, such as bioplastic (PHA) production. We have engineered Pseudomas putida with a whole operon that allows the formation of a biofilm on the worm. Biofilm formation is swhitched on and off depending on the media, and thus bacteria get on and off the worm like travellers on a bus. We have also engineered a third partner, E. coli, to express an interference RNA that promotes clumping. Taken together, our artificial symbiosis allows biotechnologically interesting bacteria to travel on nematodes, reach nutrient-rich biomass spots and maximize the efficiency of biotechnological fermentations in heterogenous substrates.
https://teams.igem.org/1113	Manufacturing	Compartmentalization is a characteristic of complex biological systems. Carboxysomes are proteinaceous bacterial microcompartments that evolved to optimize bacterial metabolic reactions. We sought to take advantage of this biological principle to design a platform for in vitro metabolic engineering. Whateversisome its based on two hypotheses: the targeting signal to the microcompartment is present in a subunit of RuBisCO and that after isolation Carboxysomes can maintain their metabolic capacity in vitro. To address these hypotheses, we designed a system to target proteins of interest to the Carboxysome using RuBisCO subunits as targeting signals. We showed colocalization of GFP fusion proteins and Carboxysome shell-proteins fused to RFP. Second, we designed a simple system for Carboxysome purification based on biotinylation that should enable easy isolation of recombinant Whateversisomes. Our approach would enable combinatorial in vitro metabolic engineering by producing and combining arbitrary Whateversisomes. This project takes advantage of subcellular organizational principles for metabolic engineering.

MoClo is a one-pot digestion-ligation assembly technique developed by Weber in 2011, which enables faster and more efficient construction of genetic circuits when compared to BioBricks, the current iGEM standard. With our project, we are proposing that iGEM teams replace the inefficient BioBricks format with MoClo. We have expanded our library of basic MoClo DNA Parts and characterized devices using various promoter-RBS combinations via flow cytometry. We also designed and implemented a standardized data sheet with a JavaScript software program in order to easily share our library and data with the community. Our MoClo library, characterization data, and data sheet tool fill an essential role in the implementation of automated synthetic biology protocols.
https://teams.igem.org/1115	Village	The picturesque city of Sydney is marred by industrial efflux of chlorinated hydrocarbons into the aquifers around Botany Bay. 1,2-dichloroethane (DCA) is toxic and a suspected carcinogenic agent, and one of the more soluble and mobile contaminants. Conventional DCA treatment is both costly and time-consuming, involving pumping and heat-stripping groundwater. We propose a biological alternative which may be cheaper and more effective. There are strains of bacteria able to degrade low levels of organochlorine compounds in selective conditions. Polaromonas JS666 and Xanthobacter autotrophicus GJ10 contain two pathways of particular interest. Our goal is to construct our own versions of two metabolic pathways of DCA biodegradation for comparison in a BioBrick-compatible vector, and characterise their effectiveness in utilising DCA as a sole carbon source for growth. We hope to create friendly strains of bacteria capable of removing DCA at greatly reduced cost and effort, and reduce the environmental impact of industry.

We hope target gene expression level has a strong adaptability and ability to DNA copy number by using the method of engineering and bringing in incoherent feed-forward circuit. The robust circuits we designed may apply to cancer detection and gene therapy in the future. Generally speaking, we modeled three and four nodes motifs to find some appropriate circuits, which function reliably in the face of fluctuating stoichiometry of their molecular components. Two designed circuits have been tested and we found that the motifs has certain robustness to DNA copy number.

However, the cooling system can result in a great consumption of energy, which increases the cost of production and causes resources wasting, global warming indirectly. To settle this problem, we constructed an Intelligent Microbial Heat Regulating Engine (I'MHeRE), which includes the customized thermo-tolerance system and the intelligent quorum regulating system, to help cells resist heat by regulating the expression of heat shock proteins and controlling the density of cells. The chassis host with I'MHeRE may make the fermentation less depend on the cooling system and shrink cost. Besides, cells could live well in higher temperature, because we extend their optimum living temperature and make them live in optimizing density. Owing to this, the activity of the enzymes in cells could be increased and the efficiency of microbial metabolism could be improved.
https://teams.igem.org/1118	Health & Medicine	Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is the cancer biomarker at early stages of several cancers including colorectal carcinoma, lung carcinoma and others. The aim of the study is to develop a biosensor that can be used in the detection of CEA. In the first part of the study ssDNA aptamers, with strong affinity for CEA, were selected by 12 cycles of Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment procedure, and characterized with dot-blot analysis and Surface Plasmon Resonance methods. In the last part, it is planned to clone the genes that will assist in expression of streptavidin on the surface of E. coli and S. cerevisiae membrane. E. coli will deliver streptavidin on the surface via Lpp-Omp expression system, while S. cerevisiae via Aga1  Aga2 system. Modified model organisms, aptamers and CEA will be used to construct sandwich-biosensor.
https://teams.igem.org/1119	Village	While low-fat diet and regular exercise are popular approaches to fight with obesity, one easy alternative is simply to increase energy metabolism. In a synthetic biology approach, we are working to create an artificial futile cycle in mammalian cell by introducing glyoxylate enzymes native to bacteria. Past research has shown that mice expressing enzymes constituting an active glyoxylate shunt are shown to be resistant to diet-induced obesity. Our team plans to introduce an inducible system that allows us to couple the sensing of circulating fatty acid concentrations with an inducible circuit of glyoxylate shunt. Our inducible system is intended to prevent the risk of fatty acid deficiency, while facilitating greater fatty acid uptake at higher fatty acid circulating concentrations. Such a system should increase the feasibility of a glyoxylate cycle engineered to function in vivo.

https://teams.igem.org/1121	Village	Malarial mosquitoes are developing resistance to key insecticides and drugs, and are becoming diurnal to avoid treated mosquito nets. Recent studies have shown that the African mosquito uses human foot odour to locate its host, a trait that is enhanced when the insect is carrying malaria. We plan to combine a carboxylic acid reductase and an acetyl transferase, in order to create E. coli capable of converting a major component of foot odour (isovaleric acid) into banana smell (isoamyl ester). This could have both commercial and humanitarian applications. Our second goal is to deliberately synthesize mosquito attractants inside traps. Recent research has shown that a mixture of CO2 and foot odour volatiles can be more attractive than a human. We have chosen indole as our first attractant, a compound naturally found in human sweat. We hope our project will show that bioremediation and biosynthesis techniques have applications in mosquito control.
https://teams.igem.org/1122	Environment	The Edinburgh iGEM 2013 team, WastED, is focusing on remediation and valorization of industrial waste streams, with a particular focus on Scottish leather and whisky industry waste waters, containing toxic heavy metal ions as well as fermentable organic components. Using Bacillus subtilis as chassis, we are engineering organisms to capture ions using chelators and metal binding proteins, and to ferment organic components to produce biofuels. We are also testing a new assembly procedure, GenBrick, based on the Genabler assembly system. GenBrick allows assembly of multiple RFC10-compatible BioBricks in a single reaction, and is also well suited to the preparation of fusion proteins and addition of terminal tags. Enzyme fusions may enhance metabolic pathways through substrate channeling. We are testing the effect of protein fusions on fermentation efficiency for biofuel production. In addition, we are examining the implications of possible Scottish independence, following the 2014 referendum, for synthetic biology in Scotland.
https://teams.igem.org/1123	New Application	Our project presents an alternative solution to the use of heavy metals MRI contrast agents by focusing on CEST MRI. Within CEST imaging, proteins enclosing hydrogen atoms generate high quality images. We use Escherichia coli to create CEST proteins when the bacteria sense a hypoxic environment due to a promoter designed for this purpose, thus working as a production and delivery system for the CEST MRI contrast agent. Hypoxic regions are related to tumors, therefore our eventual goal is to use this device to target and image tumors in humans by injecting the bacteria into the bloodstream. A second application is tracking bacteria in bacterial infections studies. For the iGEM competition however, the proteins are only expressed ex-vivo: in aerobic and anaerobic conditions. We aim to achieve an efficient testing of the CEST properties of the proteins and confirm the promoters ability to express each protein.
https://teams.igem.org/1124	New Application	We designed a "multicellular" E.coli clock with a clock hand. Your naked eyes see the red clock hand moving along a circle of E. coli population on an agar plate. The clock hand, expression of mCherry gene, is driven by an engine which is constructed under the inspiration of the mechanism of action potential conduction in nerve cells. The engine consists of a positive feedback loop of AHL and negative feedback loops of TetR, AiiA and 2 types of artificial sRNA. We also designed UV reset devices using UV sensor construct. In addition, small RNAs were designed for metabolic engineering of E. coli, which is the first trial in iGEM competition. We show you the new and easy approach in genetic engineering with the BioBrick parts, which will lead to future application of sRNAs in synthetic biology.
https://teams.igem.org/1125	Food & Energy	       During winter season, due to low temperatures, fish farming is one of the most heavily affected economic venues. Due to this, year after year, several farmers are faced with many problems as a result of a loss of fish product. <p></p>       Using our background in bioengineering we suggest an innovative alternative: Our idea is based on heterologues expression of SrUCP in <em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em> and <em>Rhodotorula glutinis</em>. Through the expression plasmid, yeasts are transformed from the wild-type phenotype into a thermogenic phenotype. <p></p>       To implement this idea and make it simple and efficient, we plan to drive the expression of SrUCP under the control of cold shock promoter Tir1. In this way, yeasts will generate heat only when the temperatures drop. Moreover, the temperature-responsive range of Tir1 may be regulated by applying genetic circuits, providing the means to manipulate the biological device to suit different temperature conditions and needs in application.
https://teams.igem.org/1126	Information Processing	<p>Every organism has its own cycle such as the periodicity of cell division, ordered patterns of its body. Some kinds of the cycles are regulated just by two factors. Using E. coli, we applied this kind of periodicity formation.</p> <p>Firstly, we focused on oscillation regulated by RNA. We suspected if RNA world hypothesis is correct, there could be protein-depended oscillatory system. To show the possibility of cycle formation by RNA, we constructed an oscillator by utilizing two different types of functional RNA, which are transcriptional activator and repressor.</p> <p>Secondly, we also targeted on planar oscillation forming mechanism. A. Turing (1952) suggested a simple principle containing just two variables which explains many organisms epidermal pattern formation. However, it is not confirmed whether the pattern formation is only based on Turings discourses. To check this, we used two types of E. coli, which secrete different factors, and regulated their population.</p>
https://teams.igem.org/1127	Food & Energy	We envisage a world where your mobile phone my one day be powered by synthetically engineered microorganisms, when non-renewable energy is a thing of the past. Our project comes at a time when all sources of energy are fighting to be the lesser of many evils; we would therefore like to propose a cheaper, greener and more effective source of energy. Currently, fuel cells do not produce sufficient power to be used for household appliances. Our genetically engineered organism will help us change this and be the first step in the Renewable Revolution. Bacteria are the most abundant form of life on Earth, they survive in harsh environments and they divide rapidly. Thus, they can be a renewable, sustainable source of energy. Our organism will deposit gold nanoparticles on the battery to increase its conductivity. These gold ions come from toxic pharmaceutical waste which is extremely harmful to the environment.
https://teams.igem.org/1128	Foundational Advance	The code of life is more than a sequence of As, Cs, Ts and Gs; epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, are powerful and heritable regulators of gene expression. Targeted methyltransferases are enzymes that catalyze sequence-specific methylation  the most useful tool for engineering the epigenome. With a synthetic biology approach, we developed an assay to test targeted methyltransferases without expensive, time-consuming traditional methods. Our modular single-plasmid system allows methyltransferases to be easily cloned and tested via inexpensive digestion assays, quickly measuring the existence and extent of targeted methylation. Additionally, our plasmid contains standardized primer-binding sites for methylation-sensitive sequencing, and our E. coli chassis effectively eliminated noise associated with methylation studies. We are using this assay to characterize our novel targeted methyltransferases, which could be used to study epigenetic modifications. In the future, synthetic biologists could embrace these tools to explore the next frontier in engineering biological systems: the epigenome.
https://teams.igem.org/1129	Village	The past decade has seen the emergence of robust bioprocessing strains engineered to synthesize discrete molecular products. The next-generation of strains could be programmable, with on demand generation of molecules within a bioreactor e.g. a yogurt fermentation capable of making any combination of flavouring, nutrients or pharmaceuticals. While merging all this potential into single hosts seems efficient, it would also bring added risk in the case of a process failure due to bacteriophage infection. Here, we not only rationally design widespread immunity to phage infection, but also hack this immunity system to yield programmable biosynthesis at the community level. We demonstrate this by building both broadly and specifically neutralizing CRISPR systems that were paired with biosynthetic capabilities for vanillin, caffeine and cinnamaldehyde production. Eventually, a fermentative process could exist that is vaccinated to phage infection but susceptible to targeted phage addition that results in a programmable probiotic  or ultrabiotic.

Along the competition have been present several projects about probiotics, nevertheless the main disadvantage was that most of them were not being created in a lactobacillus strain. Because of this we constructed a Lactobacillus platform for others iGEM teams. Continuing with the idea of the smart probiotic system we include a sensor for xenobiotic substances that could detect and decrease intoxications by pesticides. Also the team implemented a kill switch for safety issues. This project contributes to resolve one of the Mexican food and health problems.
https://teams.igem.org/1131	Manufacturing	The world consumes over 40 million kilograms of indigo annually, primarily for dyeing denim. Indigo is currently derived from petroleum using a high energy process, and commercial dyeing involves the use of reducing agents to solubilize the dye. The development of biosynthetic and bioprocessing methodologies for indigo dyeing could have environmental and economic advantages. By combining the biosynthesis of indigo and the use of the natural indigo precursor indican, we propose a more sustainable dyeing method as an alternative to chemically-reduced indigo in the large scale production of indigo textiles. We achieved in vivo indigo production in high titers, and efficient cleavage of indican using a non-native glucosidase. Inspired by natural systems, we isolated and characterized several plant and bacterial glucosyl transferases hypothesized to produce indican. Lastly, we compare the cost and environmental impact of our alternative with the present chemical process.

https://teams.igem.org/1136	Environment	Endolysins are the bacteriophage proteins responsible for lysing target bacteria by degrading the peptidoglycan layer. The use of endolysins to fight bacterial plant disease is an emerging field, but it has largely been limited to gram-positive bacteria, as the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria prevents endolysins from accessing the peptidoglycan. Recombinant E. coli have been created to express endolysins which target various plant pathogens. These proteins can be used as a novel gram-negative bactericide when coupled with a treatment to disrupt the outer membrane. A system to easily detect outer membrane disruption will be critical to our project, as well as any future studies on gram-negative endolysins. To address this, a registered iGEM part used for cell surface detection was improved and incorporated into a fluorescence-based assay. Erwinia amylovora, a gram-negative bacterium responsible for fire blight in fruit trees, was chosen as a model target for proof of concept.

Our 4 synergistic projects aim to help in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of tuberculosis. 1) We are reproducing an essential MTb metabolic pathway in E. coli, where it can be easily and safely targeted in a drug screen. 2) We are building a phage-based biosensor to allow the rapid diagnosis specifically drug-resistant MTb strains. 3) We are constructing a mycobacteriophage to detect and counterselect drug-resistant Mtb in the environment. 4) We are programming E. coli to follow MTb into human macrophages and saturate it with bacteriolytic enzymes. We want to vanquish tuberculosis and build a TB-free world.

We report the biosynthesis of geraniol at over 5% of DCW by transforming the vector into <i>Methanococcus</i> thereby expanding its native isoprenoid pathway. Furthermore we engineered new vectors (BBa_K1138001 & BBa_K1138002) with the potential capability of regulating and quantifying the expression of desired proteins via red fluorescence. This work demonstrates the use of <i>Methanococcus</i> as a cell factory for chemical production and highlights synthetic biology advancement by engineering new systems over traditional biological systems such as <i>Escherichia coli</i>.
https://teams.igem.org/1139	Information Processing	In our project, we propose to create E. coli that mimic some of the qualities of Japans ancient ninja warrior-spies. A ninja must receive and pass on correct information at all times. A mistake will be fatal. We have created a circuit that avoids crosstalk between two signals in cell-to-cell communication, and we are also looking into applications for it. Ninjas are also known for their star-shaped shuriken throwing knives. Our E. coli ninja has a similar weapon, an M13 phage which it releases to infect other E. coli, injecting plasmid DNA into them. Finally, ninja must harmonize with the natural environment, so their relationship to it is very important. Plant hormones help plants to grow efficiently, and we are attempting to construct a circuit that synthesizes two plant hormones depending on the soil environment.
https://teams.igem.org/1140	Information Processing	Temperature sensing RNA sequences, known as RNA thermometers, regulate translation by preventing the ribosome from binding the transcript until higher temperatures shift it to an open structure. Several naturally occurring RNA thermometers have been described, and synthetic sequences that emulate them have been designed and proved to regulate genetic expression at different temperature ranges. Here, we intend to build a genetic circuit that results in three discrete states whose transition can be regulated by temperature changes only. Most notably, our circuit integrates transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation, widening the spectrum of potential genetic circuit topologies for synthetic biology, with applications that range from basic research to the replacement of chemical inducers for industrial-scale processes.
https://teams.igem.org/1141	New Application	Maintaining cell growth state during culturing is generally difficult due to metabolic adaptation and changing cell division rates. Using light-induced promoters and a phototoxic fluorescent protein, we've designed TalkE. coli. It uses light signals to communicate with bacteria allowing the researcher to remotely control the cultures using a computer. Cell density is monitored through fluorescence recordings and, thanks to a predictive model, TalkE. coli responds by illuminating the culture with one or more wavelengths to obtain different effects: killing off cells beyond a threshold density, or producing or degrading protein. The tool is portable and mountable in an incubator making it a handy device for research.

This because at the present time there isnt a program for reusing this waste, and producers find it difficult to treat them properly because of its chemical composition. Our idea consists in the modification of the bacteria Rhodococcus opacus to enhance the absorption of lactose and the overexpression of the natural triglycerides (TGA) producing ability of R. opacus, achieved by inserting an optimized sequence of a DGA acyltransferase gene and lactose absorption genes, constitutively expressed, also with an optimized sequence of a lipase from B. cepacia which is the responsible to break down the TGAs and an inducible suicide device in order to extract them with ease. Now all what it takes to finish the job is adding some ethanol to obtain our biodiesel!

https://teams.igem.org/1145	Environment	Atrazine, a widely used herbicide, persists for a long period in the environment onced used. It causes metabolic disorders in both animals and humankind. Our team utilized the ribosome switch induced by atrazine, a QS system of Plux and a degrading enzyme to control E.coils motility through regulating its CheZ gene. Therefore, E.coli can recognize atrazine, recruit team workers, and degrade atrazine. Our team found a transporter of atrazine, which we call TRM. We also mutated the degrading enzyme, TrzN, making it better at degradation. We combined TRM and the TrzN to improve atrazine absorbance and degradation. Moreover, our team are trying to analyze and compare several systems with computer, hoping to find the best one which is equipped with faster moving and quicker degrading. Overall,we believe our system will boost the industrialization, universalization as well as standardization in the field of treatment for atrazine and other versatile small molecules.
https://teams.igem.org/1146	Environment	The Korea_U_Seoul team aims to design Pearl-coli that is E. coli able to convert atmospheric CO2 into pearl powder materials. The design is based on cell surface display of nacrein in E.coli. Nacrein is a major protein component in nacre(an organic-inorganic composite layer found in outer coating of pearls). We divided nacrein into functional regions - carbonic anhydrase(CA), calcium binding and scaffold repeats. CA domain fixes CO2 into carbonic acid changing to bicarbonate ion in aqueous solution. We will examine if displayed nacrein in E. coli can make a pearl powder in a solution or fabricate a nacre-like structure while atmospheric CO2 is fixed into bicarbonate. Once a nacre material can be prepared from Pearl-coli, we will grow E. coli in a confined container to make synthetic pearl. The Pearl-coli has dual-function such as (1) mitigate the global warming by CO2 reduction, (2) prepare valuable pearl-like raw materials.

https://teams.igem.org/1149	Manufacturing	Accumulation of waste represents a considerable problem to humanity. Over the next 50 years, the global community will produce approximately 2 trillion tonnes of waste, or 2.5 times the weight of Mount Everest. Traditionally, mixed non-recyclable waste is sent to landfill or for incineration, both of which result in environmental damage. The detrimental effects are perpetrated by the plastic degradation into toxic byproducts and the production of greenhouse gases by these processes. As an alternative we propose to upcycle this mixed waste into the bioplastic poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (P3HB) to create a closed loop recycling system. Our engineered E. coli will operate within sealed bioreactors. In the future we picture the use of our system in a variety of contexts as part of our M.A.P.L.E. (Modular And Plastic Looping E.coli) system.
https://teams.igem.org/1150	Foundational Advance	Our Team developed a universal toolkit, termed uniCAS, that enables customizable gene regulation in mammalian cells. Therefore, we engineered the recently discovered and highly promising CRISPR/Cas9 system. The regulation is based on the RNA-guided Cas9 protein, which allows targeting of specific DNA sequences. Our toolkit comprises not only a standardized Cas9 protein, but also different effector domains for efficient gene activation or repression. We further engineered a modular RNA plasmid for easy implementation of RNA guide sequences. As an additional feature, we established an innovative screening method for assessing the functionality of our uniCAS fusion proteins. Single genes and even whole genetic networks can be modified using our uniCAS toolkit. We think that our toolbox of standardized parts of the CRISPR/Cas9 system offers broad application in research fields such as tissue engineering, stem cell reprogramming and fundamental research.

Our project aims to develop a living system in two <b>easy monitorable</b> bacterial platforms who would work as a <b>Nickel detector</b> and a <b>Nickel remediation</b> system. The devices are based on genetic parts from <i>Helicobacter pylori</i>: from the nickel sensing device, <i> H.pylori</i> NikR protein, to the Nickel storage system, Hpn protein, whose role is to store the Nickel ions inside the cell. The two devices are split in two separate populations, which intercommunicate through <i>Quorum Sensing</i>. The system allows to remove the Nickel ions from polluted environmental substrates through bioaccumulation and could be easily implemented in purification plants.
https://teams.igem.org/1152	Foundational Advance	Several secondary metabolites, such as commonly used antibiotics, pigments and detoxifying enzymes, are synthesized by non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). These enzymes beautifully reflect one of the fundamental principles of synthetic biology, as they are remarkably modular. We will assemble new NRPSs by combining individual domains and modules of different origin, thus setting the basis for novel and customized synthesis of non-ribosomal peptides. To make the use of NRPSs amenable to a wider community, we will devise a new software-tool, called NRPS Designer, which predicts the optimal modular composition of synthetic NRPSs for production of any desired peptide and outputs a cloning strategy based on Gibson assembly. As an application relevant to society, we will engineer <i>Escherichia coli</i> to recycle gold from electronic waste in a cost- and energy-efficient way through the heterologous expression of the NRPS pathway of <i>Delftia acidovorans</i> that naturally enables precipitation of gold ions from solution.

Our system will utilise an engineered strain of <i>E. coli</i> which will be capable of converting this excess NO into ammonia. Our Biobricks have been designed to enable the detection of NO using the <i>norV</i> promoter. The NO can then be converted into ammonia via the nitrite reductase enzyme encoded by the <i>E. coli</i> gene <i>NrfA</i>. Our solution will have many advantages over the current approaches to waste water treatment such as reduced cost and risk of contamination. Our system will provide a source of recycled ammonia and could be a greener alternative to the Haber Bosch process.
https://teams.igem.org/1154	Foundational Advance	CUPID aims for stable obligate symbiosis for the model prokaryote Escherichia coli (bacteria) and the model eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast). We address this goal by constructing a unique platform for interspecies-dependence based on inducible expression of a required histidine biosynthetic gene (HIS) in each species. Expression of the bacterial HIS gene is induced by lactic acid produced by constitutive expression of a lactate dehydrogenase gene in the eukaryote. Expression of the yeast HIS gene is induced by the binding of its mating factor receptor to mating factor expressed constitutively on the surface of the prokaryote. Histidine deprivation necessitates physical contact and symbiosis for survival. Such pressure may facilitate evolution of a stable exosymbiotic form of the two species. Study of isolates and further manipulation could provide insight into the use of obligate symbiosis in synthetic biology and yield a chassis for the synthesis of novel multicellular machines.
https://teams.igem.org/1155	Environment	PCBs (Polychlorobiphenyls) are synthetic chemicals widely used during the late 20th century. These compounds are extraordinarily stable, not readily biodegradable and have accumulated in the environment. PCBs also accumulate in animal fatty tissues including human tissues. As PCBs are probably carcinogenic and some are endocrine disruptors, they constitute an important health issue. Although PCBs have no natural equivalents, some bacterial communities have developed the capacity to degrade PCBs. Highly chlorinated PCBs undergo anaerobic reductive dechlorination, lowering the chlorine atom number. Lightly chlorinated PCBs are then degraded via the aerobic biphenyl degradation pathway. Our project is to <b>construct an <i>Escherichia coli</i> strain capable of degrading PCBs</b> by introducing in the strain genes involved in PCB degradation in various bacteria. Because some steps are anaerobic and others aerobic, we want to <b>use an oxygen-based regulation of gene expression</b>. We also want to <b>develop a sensor system to detect PCBs</b> in the environment.
https://teams.igem.org/1156	Foundational Advance	Our team goal is to develop novel bacterial BioBots that respond to the extracellular tissue environment. Mammalian cells communicate with the extracellular matrix (ECM) using heterodimeric cell surface receptors, called integrins, which can signal in a bidirectional manner between the cell interior and ECM. We aimed to express the integrin &#945;IIb&#946;3 in E. coli cells. To promote dimerization of the integrin subunits, we attempted to optimize bimolecular fluorescence complementation of split GFP using surface display technologies. We cloned split GFP parts, assembling the T7-promoter, LacI-operator, and ribosomal binding site (RBS) upstream of the protein-coding region. To verify &#945;IIb&#946;3 function, we developed an integrin activity sensor consisting of the ligand derived from fibrinogen (KQAGDV) coupled to GFP. Finally, we successfully created a new standard for RBS addition that inputs the strong RBS (BBa_B0034) in front of any standard BioBrick part, which is efficient and more successful than the usual 3A/standard assembly.
https://teams.igem.org/1157	Health & Medicine	Bacterial infection is the invasion of the body by pathogenic bacteria, which causes pneumonia, urethral infection, bacteremia and other symptoms in hospital and community. The efficiency of traditional detection and diagnostic approaches is impeded by the time-consuming laboratory procedures, yet many of which grow poorly in bacterial cultures. All these limitations call for a new rapid and direct bacterial identification method to improve patient management and antimicrobial therapy. Quorum sensing is a type of bacterial cell-cell communication correlates with the population size. Many bacteria have one or several species-specific quorum sensing molecules released in different growth state and environment. Quorum sensing signals are shown to be involved in many physiological functions, including virulence, biofilm formation and drug-resistance. We aim to establish a novel bacterial identification method in clinical samples based on the quorum sensing profiles.

The aim is to create a biological platform within a model organism, such as common yeast, to develop an alternative method for production of several aromatic monoterpenoids. The advantage of this organism as producer lies in its capabilities of genetic modification, robustness and culture simplicity. We can also control the production of these compounds using different promoters, so we can choose our favourite aroma while there is repellent activity. The microorganism is completely harmless as it is responsible for fermenting bread and beer. The project aims to establish the basis for future production of repellents in a sustainable and organical manner in developing homes that are under the risk of pandemics caused by mosquitoes and other insects.
https://teams.igem.org/1159	Environment	The contamination of aquatic ecosystems with multiple anthropogenic pollutants has become a problem since the industrial revolution. Antibiotics, hormones and various noxious substances threaten environmental health and are not effectively removed by conventional waste water treatment. We propose to employ transgenic plants which produce effectors for enzymatic degradation (BioDegradation) or specific binding (BioAccumulation) of pollutants. The autotrophic, sedentary, aquatic nature of the moss <i>Physcomitrella patens</i> makes it an ideal chassis for a self-renewing, low-maintenance and cheap water filter. A light-triggered kill switch prevents unintended environmental spreading by limiting viability to places where the spectrum of sun light is appropriately filtered. Furthermore, we have developed a device to implement this biological filter in an aquatic environment, investigated the application of this new technology and examined its economic feasibility. Based on our results, PhyscoFilter may become a game-changing approach to improve global water quality in an affordable and sustainable fashion.

The CRISPRs and Cas (CRISPR-associated) interact and form this prokaryotic adaptive immune system. Cas9, as a core of CRISPR system, can play a role of targeted-attacking gene "missiles". Therefore, we build a sort of plasmids, loading CRISPR system, to realize the "killing" of harmful genes and/or organisms.

Our travelling salesman computer is built from a combination of raw DNA chemistry and bacterial colonies: first it assembles the routes by stringing genes together, treating them like roads on the salesman's map, then the bacteria sort the good routes from the bad, identifying the answer through the quantity of bacterial colonies making use of each route. The most commonly used route is the winner!
https://teams.igem.org/1162	Manufacturing	Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are peptides that have activity against a wide range of microorganisms. AMPs can vary greatly in their size, structure, and mode of antimicrobial activity. Due to the immense interest in both testing and characterizing AMPs (from various forms of life) a sustainable method to produce and purify them is necessary. Using Synthetic Biology as a platform, the production of AMPs in E.coli could potentially offer a cost-effective approach for large-scale peptide manufacture, as opposed to isolation from natural sources. After successfully manufacturing several AMPs using E.coli, these peptides will be tested on a wide variety of organisms to screen for antimicrobial activity.

The aim of our project is to prevent the intestinal absorption of iron by engineering <i>Escherichia coli</i> to produce siderophores, chelators of iron. This strategy acts directly at the source. </p> <p> We engineer <i>Escherichia coli</i> using the Ferric Uptake Regulation (FUR) couple to an inverter system, in order to produce these siderophores in presence of iron. To reduce the patient's iron absorption, our bacteria is encapsulated in a pill. Once it arrives in the duodenum, our bacteria will produce the siderophore at their full potential and chelate the iron. </p>
https://teams.igem.org/1164	New Application	Many synthetic gene networks are susceptible to cellular noise, as they rely upon the absolute levels of gene regulators which can vary greatly between individual cells. To address this, uOttawa has engineered a network in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> that is responsive to fold-changes as opposed to absolute changes in stimulus. This allows the network to maintain sensitivity despite noise, and also permits response to stimuli in a much larger dynamic range. By modifying the promoter driving the stimulus, the network can be engineered to detect fold-changes of any molecule with a responsive promoter, thereby serving as a structural chassis for the next generation of molecule detectors. In addition, we have also authored a children's book aimed at disseminating the concepts of synthetic biology to the public, and have designed an online interface that will facilitate the rapid construction of devices built from the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
https://teams.igem.org/1165	Information Processing	Our aim is to achieve <b>universally computational cells</b> through the exploitation of cell-cell communication to generate biological cellular automata. To achieve this, we are using an array of <i>E. coli</i> colonies, which implement the same logical functionality while using different input/output interfaces. The strains process their inputs (two inputs from neighbors plus their own current state) to decide what their next state will be, after the application of a global clock.<br/> At the heart of our project is the construction of the clock, to synchronize information processing. We are making a fusion protein of ETR1 from <i>A. thaliana</i> and <i>EnvZ</i> from <i>E. coli</i> to allow cells to respond to ethylene gas concentrations. All cells will produce this gas at cyclic intervals, thus creating a <b>truly autonomous</b> clock. We have also devised an RNA-based system that can process information reliably and expediently with the use of ribozyme-based XOR and AND gates.
https://teams.igem.org/1166	Health & Medicine	By harnessing the inherent ability of facultative anaerobic bacteria to colonize and grow in tumoral environments, this project aims to prove the functionality of four different modules that would work together as a bacterial cancer therapy using Escherichia coli as chasis: Toxicity module, Secretion module, Localized induction module, and Internalization module. The expression of tumor specific therapeutic proteins, Apoptin and TRAIL, conforms the toxicity module. For these proteins to have their effect they need to be located in the extracellular matrix, therefore we are developing a module with a secretion function using hemolysin secretory mechanism. The hypoxic microenvironment present in tumors can be used for the localized induction module of tumor specific proteins, using the promoters HIP and nirB. Finally, Apoptin needs mechanisms to enter tumor cells cytoplasm. Proteins with this requirement could reach the cytoplasm when coupled with the internalization module, resulting in a fusion with the TAT peptide.

https://teams.igem.org/1169	Environment	The nif cluster of Cyanothece 51142 consists of 29 genes that construct and regulate a nitrogenase protein complex. This year, our iGEM team worked on harnessing the power of nif to produce ammonia in Escherichia coli. After synthesizing a nif-containing plasmid (28 kbp) using the DNA assembler method (Shao et al 2009) and transforming that plasmid into E. coli, our team tested for nitrogenase activity using the acetylene reduction assay. The transformed E. coli were then compared to wild-type under limited nitrogen conditions to check for a competitive advantage. Tests were used to evaluate the expression of various nitrogenase subunits. Our team also aimed to further characterize the promoter sequences of the Cyanothece 51142 nif cluster. Between the cysE and nifB genes, there is a 958bp uncharacterized, bidirectional promoter region of particular interest. We used fluorescent reporters to identify key regions within this promoter sequence under various environmental conditions.

The response can be targeted for specific pH ranges, for example in tracking the anomalies associated with the gut micro-biota or detecting pH inside a bioreactor. There are only limited studies reported in the area. In the present project, a genetic circuit has been created, using the promoters of the acid shock response gene from E.coli and the F0F1 ATPase operon from C. glutamicum that produces a pH dependent colour gradient, much like a universal pH indicator. A mathematical model has been developed to simulate the experimental findings. The present study will form the basis for further research in the field of synthetic biology.

Therefore, we are developing a Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC). The goal of this project is to generate electricity with a modified Escherichia coli in a self-constructed fuel cell. Besides the technical optimization of the fuel cell, we investigate different genetic approaches like integrating porines and cytochromes as well as endogenous mediators. Using heterologous expression of pore-forming transmembrane proteins, we are able to enhance the extracellular electron transfer, leading to higher membrane permeability. Direct electron transfer can be achieved by integrating cytochromes into the cellular membrane, whereas a production of endogenous mediators enhances the electron transport to the electrode. With different aspects for technical and genetic optimization we enable Ecolectricity, the use of E. coli for direct energy production.

Many bacterial systems currently rely on external stimuli to induce transcription. One dimensional protocols often require constant monitoring of applied chemical concentrations, leading to them becoming inept for more complex systems. A triplet of NOT gated photoreceptors in Escherichia coli, will be used to create a system which is finely controlled using only light. This will be showcased using magenta, cyan and yellow pigments as outputs. Varying the intensity and wavelength of light projected onto E. coli will control the shade and colour produced, respectively. Hence, this will show the versatility of the optical control by creating a full colour bio-camera. Additionally, using bacteria to produce an image vastly increases the resolution when compared to conventional cameras, due to the micrometre scale of bacteria.

The induced gene can be secreted from the cytoplasm to the extracellular space via a tripartite secI pump. A cymR-regulated T5cumate promoter within the plasmid controls a Tse2 toxin to avoid horizontal gene transfer, while the plasmid also encodes a chimeric ompA-monoclonal antibody gene, which when expressed, inserts into the outer membrane and the antibody selectively binds norovirus within the gut to hinder infection. This plasmid construct was used to over-express and secrete plant-based, polymer-degrading enzymes bglS, yesZ, and xynA isolated from the cellulosome of Bacillus subtilis subtilis 168 to digest plant material. We utilized Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 containing a chromosome-integrated cymR gene to secrete these enzymes in the hope to accentuate dietary uptake for humans and livestock in impoverished countries.
https://teams.igem.org/1176	Foundational Advance	Both the mammalian immune systems complex defenses and a bacteriophages targeting mechanism depend upon protein diversification. These models have inspired innovations ranging from targeted drug delivery to protein display. Using the major tropism determining (MTD) protein expressed on the Bordatella bacteriophage BPP-1, we aim to develop an in vitro system for generating antibody-like proteins that bind specified targets. The MTD protein expressed at the phages tail fiber is naturally modified at its variable region to produce nearly 10e13 possible binding variants while preserving its structure. Mutating the MTDs variable region by PCR can match the massive diversity of MTD in vitro. A library of MTD protein-DNA fusions generated by mRNA display can then be screened for binding against specified protein targets. This in vitro analog to phage display and immune clonal selection can be a powerful tool for constructing target-binding MTD variants with equally many varied applications.

https://teams.igem.org/1178	Manufacturing	Mussel adhesive proteins (MAPs) are water-resistant bioadhesives that have a variety of biomedical and construction applications. Replicating the natural properties of MAPs through in vivo production using microbes is difficult as it depends on post-translational modifications, primarily the hydroxylation of tyrosine residues to L-DOPA. Since adhesiveness is correlated with L-DOPA content, our project aims to improve the adhesive properties of MAPs by utilizing a strain which inserts the non-canonical amino acid L-DOPA at UAG stop codons during translation. When combined with the in vivo production of free L-DOPA, this system is a significant step towards rapid, cost-effective MAPs production. Our team also worked on degrading odorous compounds, computationally modeled the detection of potentially dangerous oligo orders, and created BactoArt using inducible fluorescent proteins. Additionally, we created the Open Sequence Initiative, which is focused on updating the standards for submitting BioBricks to the iGEM Registry.

While there has been some success engineering single signals, sending multiple signaling elements spanning spatial scales for multicellular coordination remains a significant hurdle. Here, we describe a method for mammalian cell-cell communication utilizing engineered exosomes containing miRNA or protein signals. First, we demonstrate selectively packaging signaling miRNAs (miR-451 and miR-503) and synthetic fusion proteins (GFP, Cas9, and Cre recombinase each individually fused to the oligomerizing membrane targeting domain Acyl-TyA) into exosomes within cells engineered with sender genetic circuits. Next, we demonstrate that these miRNA and protein signals can modulate gene expression within cells engineered with receiver genetic circuits. Finally, we present preliminary cell-cell signaling results on populations of cocultured sender and receiver cells. Our method may enable multiplexed communication among populations of various cell types and the creation of sophisticated synthetic tissues.

Given the intrinsic ability to naturally transport functional RNAs between cells, MVs potentially represent a novel and exciting drug carrier. In our project we are trying to express both anti-virus siRNA within the cell and target protein on the surface of the MVs by engineering the HEK 293T cell, which is capable of producing large amounts of MVs. Thus, the MVs produced by our engineered HEK 293T cells will contain the siRNA and be able to specifically deliver the siRNA to the sites we want, acting as biomissile for the targeted destruction of the disease.

Several of known problems with carbohydratesweeteners like diabetes or caries could be overcome by the Steviolglycosides which are produced by Stevia rebaudiana.

An alternative to conventional antibiotics is phage therapy. However, many temperate phage also form prophage. Our approach to antibiotic resistance is to engineer a temperate phage, Lambda, with light-activated production of superoxide. The fluorescent protein KillerRed was cloned into a plasmid vector and lambda gt11 with the IPTG inducible lac promoter. Lysogens were isolated and these strains were characterized and compared to E. coli with KillerRed from high-copy plasmids. Light activation of KillerRed resulted in decreased cell numbers. In addition, we modeled our system at multiple scales, including populations of phage and bacteria, KillerRed gene expression, ROS production, and effects of light. Having two methods of killing, lysis and superoxide, decreases the probability of developing resistance and our system overcomes the prior limitations of using wild-type temperate phages.

The lack of a cell wall imparts a range of interesting properties and we show that L-forms can be used as a novel chassis for a range of fundamental applications in synthetic biology. We produced a BioBrick for Bacillus subtilis, that allows cell morphology to be toggled from normal to L-form. We have explored some of the interesting opportunities that L-forms provide including cell fusion, genome shuffling and the generation of differently shaped cells using microfluidics. L-forms are thought to exist naturally within plant tissues and we also studied their use as agents for delivering novel functionality into plants. For project outreach, we created a game as an Android application and considered the implications raised by our project and also look at the exciting relationship between synthetic biology and architecture.

To address this, we have constructed pMNBB, a versatile shuttle vector system. pMNBB vectors provide researchers a modular BioBrick platform to introduce synthetic pathways into E. coli and also the option to rapidly transfer these constructs into P. pastoris. Not only is this vector system designed for integration of expression cassettes into the P. pastoris genome, but we have also added elements which allow for the episomal maintenance of these plasmids. Moreover, these vectors are amenable to trans-kingdom conjugation (TKC). Rather than following a yeast transformation protocol that can take days to weeks, our constructs may be introduced to a yeast culture in roughly one hour. Finally, as a proof-of-concept, we use the pMNBB vector system to produce and secrete active human insulin from P. pastoris.

Along the way we explored some novel approaches to DNA and protein purification and developed experimentally tested protocols for these and other procedures essential to Biobrick assembly. Our purification methods exemplify the ideal of using common lab materials to make performing everyday lab techniques as accessible and inexpensive as possible. A related aspect of our project was exploring methods of recycling consumables associated with lab work in order to reduce waste and material expenses. We hope that our findings using this "do-it-yourself" approach of synthetic biology help make this type of research more accessible for those where funding is limited.

Whether in your water, salad or steak, pathogenic E. coli causes upwards of 250,000 illnesses every year. To solve this problem, iGEM Calgary is developing the FerriTALE to detect harmful E. coli. It uses engineered proteins that detect and report the presence of dangerous E. coli in a sample. The detector, TALE, binds to genomic markers specific to dangerous E. coli. Next, our TALEs are attached to the scaffold and reporter, Ferritin, that rapidly alerts the user to the presence of E. coli through a visible color change. We have integrated these proteins into a handheld device, similar to a home pregnancy test, that tells the user if dangerous E. coli is present. Moving forward, the FerriTALE can be tailored to detect other pathogens as the basis of a powerful new detection platform.

The bacterial vaccine should activate macrophages and dendritic cells in order to teach the immune system to recognize cell surface antigens that distinguish tumors from healthy tissue. We aim to engineer lab-strain Escherichia coli and E. coli Nissle 1917, a commercial probiotic, to train the immune system to target and destroy tumor cells.

However, current chemical methods for keratin degradation are energetically costly and previous efforts at keratinase production in heterologous hosts have been stymied by poor protease expression. To address both these problems, our team constructed BioBricks based on kerA, a serine keratinase gene native to B. licheniformis active on whole poultry feathers. We designed two biobricks for expression in E. coli and constructed a high copy number BioBrick plasmid with an origin of replication compatible with B. subtilis. By designing a new keratinase expression system in B. subtilis, we hope to provide a faster, cheaper alternative to current methods of industrial keratinase production.

Here, we propose a two-fold, novel synthetic biology approach to combat the lethal effect of the toxin. We aim to neutralize the already produced toxin through a nine amino acid Gb3 mimic peptide. We have engineered the Gb3 mimic along with a cellular export signal (ompF) downstream of AHL(quorum sensing molecule) inducible promoter (pLuxR). We also plan to prevent further toxin production by inhibiting the biofilm formation of shigatoxigenic E.coli using indole-3-acetaldehyde (I3A).

Current research is focused on finding new ways to use bacteriophage either in their wild-type state or after they have been modified for use in synthetic biology. We studied two ways to modify existing well-characterized bacteriophages. First, we employed random mutagenesis, CsCl purification, and plaque-size selection to isolate T4 and T7 bacteriophage with altered capsid sizes. A library of capsid sizes will allow researchers to select the appropriate bacteriophage for use in biotechnology or nanotechnology applications. Second, we designed a cholera sensing and destruction circuit using bacteriophage lambda. In this circuit, lambda contains biofilm-degrading enzymes controlled by a cholera quorum-sensing system transferred to E. coli. Upon sensing cholera, this E. coli will activate lambda, leading to cell lysis and biofilm degradation. This research demonstrates the versatility and utility of bacteriophages in the field of synthetic biology.

Bistable switches and oscillators, key building blocks of more complex gene networks, have been constructed using naturally occurring and well-characterized regulatory elements. In order to expand the versatility and variety of these circuits, we designed and constructed gene networks using artificial transcription factors (ATFs). The ATFs are of two classes: inhibitory TAL proteins and a catalytically inactive dCas9 protein with small guide RNA elements, each orthogonal to the yeast genome. Using mathematical modeling, we determined the parameters expected to create bistability and oscillation, using tandem binding site kinetics to achieve cooperativity. Based on these results, we assembled a library of plasmids containing ATFs, binding sites, regulatory elements, and fluorescent reporters. We then integrated these genes into the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and are currently characterizing them using flow cytometry.

Recent studies demonstrate a correlation between CVD and atherosclerosis, the buildup of plaque in the arteries. One associated risk for atherosclerosis is the production of Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) by natural gut flora when metabolizing L-carnitine, a chemical found primarily in red meat and energy drinks. We created a probiotic to attack the root of this problem by outcompeting the gut bacteria for L-carnitine in order to suppress the production of TMAO. L-carnitine transporters (caiX and cbcWV) and L-carnitine dehydrogenase (CDH) derived from Pseudomonas aeruginosa were expressed in a safe strain of E. coli (Nissle 1917). This engineered E. coli can uptake and metabolize L-carnitine along an alternative, safe pathway into 3-dehydrocarnitine. Together, this system offers a novel solution in preventing TMAO-related cardiovascular health conditions.

Pon1, acting as a repressor, will degrade the signal molecules needed for quorum sensing and thus turn off quorum sensing as well as itself. It will reactivate upon the reactivation of quorum sensing and this cycle of self-regulation will persist. This prototype system is meant to test the application of this system but the main goal is to introduce this system to pseudomonas aeruginosa as a means to prevent the harm that it causes.

We propose the development of a new library of regulatory gene expression elements that allow for compression of multiple coding sequences into a smaller amount of genetic space. Using a pseudoknot RNA structural motif, commonly used by viruses to minimize their genome size, we will show the utility of dual-coding gene sequences to give useful protein products whose expression can be regulated by the pseudoknots ability to induce ribosomal frameshifting. A software tool will also be used to overlap multiple coding sequences into different reading frames. Ultimately, this library of standardized parts will be available for use in a variety of engineered systems requiring minimal coding space and multiple protein expression.
https://teams.igem.org/1211	Manufacturing	Poly(lactic acid) (PLA) is a biodegradable, biocompatible, bioresorbable, thermoplastic bioplastic that offers many advantages over other biomaterials in both commercial and medical applications. The current chemical method of synthesizing PLA is expensive, and the required processing and purifying steps use many environmentally unfriendly chemicals. Recently, E. coli has been engineered to produce PLA, but low yields and short chain lengths prevent the approachs commercial use. Here, we evaluate the potential of using multiplex automated genome engineering to raise both yields and chain lengths of biosynthesized PLA by directing the E. coli metabolism to funnel resources toward PLA production without sacrificing the organisms viability. Efficient biosynthesis of PLA, which may be thus achieved, would be a significant step in reducing the impact of plastic waste, and would benefit those receiving bone implants. It would also open up a new possibility in rapid manufacturing of personalized bone implants using three-dimensional printers.
https://teams.igem.org/1212	Foundational Advance	Despite the fact that the Registry of Standard Biological Parts contains a large number of inducible promoters, the actual usage of these parts is dominated by a very select few. In order to increase the versatility of expression control systems, we propose a new system coupling transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) with inducible riboswitches. TALEs are proteins secreted by the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas that contain engineerable, sequence-specific DNA binding domains and can act as transcriptional repressors or activators. We plan to manipulate TALE activity by subjecting them to inducible expression through riboswitches and promoters. By pairing TALEs with riboswitches, we can expand the existing library of inducible repression systems. In addition, we hope to modify the parameters of our system to show the tunability and modularity of our overall construct. Through proper characterization, we believe that iGEM teams may also use these modular repression systems for the development of future devices.

Halorhodopsins use sunlight energy to pump protons, chloride ions, or sodium ions across cell membranes. We are placing halorhodopsins at appropriate membrane poles of Caulobacter crescentus using its intracellular transport systems for flagella and stalk proteins. Fluorescently tagged pumps and light microscopy are used to determine and confirm sub-cellular location of ion pumps. Eventual testing will focus on documentation of salt movement across the Caulobacter biofilms.
https://teams.igem.org/1214	Health & Medicine	Cavities are a problem faced by people and animals worldwide and are primarily caused by the bacteria Streptococcus mutans. S. mutans digests certain sugars, consequently forming lactic acid that can lead to tooth decay. Our system starts with the detection of saccharides essential for S. mutans survival. Using dextranase, the E. coli are able to attach onto the dextran layer that S. mutans normally live on. This allows the E. coli to deliver a targeted dose of norspermidine, helping with the breakdown of S. mutans biofilms. We also took another approach that utilizes a natural quorum signaling molecule, competence stimulating peptide (CSP). This peptide is responsible for population control in S. mutans. By using these approaches, we hope to aid in the treatment of cavities in both humans and animals.

User can also utilize bricks he just designed. synthesized brick, you are provided to gene expression and modify brick by codon usage.

https://teams.igem.org/1216	Information Processing	Colisweeper is an interactive, biological version of the Minesweeper computer game, based on luxI/luxR quorum sensing and chromogenic enzymatic reactions. The goal is to clear an agar minefield without detonating mines. Genetically engineered Escherichia coli colonies are used as sender-cells (mines) and receiver-cells (non-mines). Mines secrete the signaling molecule N-(3-oxohexanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone (OHHL) whereas non-mines process the signal. To distinguish between OHHL-levels, a library of PLuxR promoters with various sensitivities was created through site-saturation mutagenesis. High-pass filters were constructed to control the expression of different orthogonal hydrolases in non-mines, depending on the number of surrounding mines. Additionally, the mines express their own hydrolase. A spatiotemporal reaction-diffusion model was established to evaluate and improve the system. To play Colisweeper, a colorless substrate solution is pipetted onto a colony of choice. The result is a defined color change within minutes, allowing identification of the played colony and the number of mines surrounding it.
https://teams.igem.org/1217	Environment	Phosphate pollution in waterways and water treatment plants is a major problem. Removal of phosphate from wastewater is required to treat phosphate-containing discharge to reduce eutrophication, algal blooms and dead zones in lakes, rivers and coastal marine ecosystems. The aim of this project was to remove or reduce the levels of inorganic phosphate from a system or environment by employing engineered bacteria <i>E. capsi</i>, capable of accumulating phosphate in the form of polyphosphate. Our strategy is to express polyphosphate kinase together with the ethanolamine utilization (eut) bacterial microcompartment from <i>Salmonella enterica</i> to provide an environment for polyphosphate synthesis. Furthermore, the project provides a novel way to recover accumulated polyphosphate, an energy rich macromolecule with many industrial uses. This paves a way towards living system-based phosphate pollution treatment to tackle critical environmental challenges.

https://teams.igem.org/1223	Environment	Bioremediation and biosensors often require the release of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) to the environment. After being released, these GMOs are no longer under direct control. As their effect on the environment is unknown, they pose a potential threat. In order to eliminate this threat, we are developing a genetic circuit, using e. coli as a model GMO, that limits the lifetime of a bacterial population after it is released to the environment. Our goal is to allow the end user to program a GMO population to survive in the environment until it has completed its task, after which the entire population will disappear without any further external intervention. We employ two approaches to achieve this goal: One relies on the dilution of a synthetic control element through cell division, and the second is based on the lifetime of an essential protein containing an unnatural amino acid.
https://teams.igem.org/1224	Information Processing	Our goal is to engineer a device allowing to save up to three binary input signals in living E. coli cells, resulting in expression of red, blue and green fluorescent proteins as reporters. Converting inducer signals into expression of serine recombinases, enzymes capable of specific DNA editing, we are able to create three transcriptional analogues of transistors - transcriptors - and to use them as elemental memory units called SR-latches under control of a fourth, strobe signal, providing a mean to reset the system to its original state. This complex biological memory unit opens the way to cheap, reversible gene induction, useful both to the industry and researchers, not only lowering inducing cost but also being less stressful for the studied organisms, e.g. plants. It is also another step towards Von Neumann-inspired biocomputers.
https://teams.igem.org/1225	WIKI	Synthetic biology has striven to prove that classical engineering principles are applicable in the field of biology. Several challenges have yet to be overcome including design of robust genetic circuits, reliable gene expression, and a standard way to characterize parts. To assess circuit robustness, we utilized the power of the Taguchi Method, a statistical analysis which optimizes a set of parameters to form a robust system against outside noise while minimizing experimental time and cost. Making bicistronic expression operating units, which reduce the variability of gene expression, available in the Registry of Standard Biology Parts will enable efficient engineering of large networks. Finally, collaboration among teams allowed for a new standardized form of submitting characterization of parts to the Parts Registry. These three approaches to improve part standardization and robustness will help move the field of synthetic biology one step closer to proving that biology can, in fact, be engineered.

https://teams.igem.org/1227	Environment	We aim to improve complex biomass treatment programs by engineering new metabolic pathways in E. coli cells. Tequila distilleries in Mexico produce large amounts of vinasses (complex biomass with high biochemical oxygen demand) that are difficult to treat with current bioremediation technologies. We are trying to simplify this treatment process by transforming E. coli cells with enzymes and metabolites that participate in the anaerobic digestion of these vinasses. We have designed regulatory networks that allow us to control the expression of specific metabolites at different timepoints of the treatment program. We believe this method will prove superior to the "free-for-all" microbial consortium approach that is currently employed by government agencies and the alcohol industry to biologically digest vinasses.

Our aim is to help in the achievement of the WHO goal of being free of human rabies by 2020 through the improvement of the vaccination coverage in dogs. The idea comes from Yersinia pestis and fleas. We make use of fleas as our moving injector. When flea feed blood from dogs, our vaccine vector Bacillus subtilis will be regurgitated into blood and successfully transferred to mammalian host. Bacillus subtilis can express antigens which can stimulate the immunity of dogs. Meanwhile, endogenous or exogenous expression of "Antimicrobial Peptides" by B. subtilis can kill Yersinia pestis in fleas. In this way we achieved a safe moving vaccine factory.

https://teams.igem.org/1230	Health & Medicine	The human peptide LL-37 is an antimicrobial peptide shown to protect against H.pylori and other pathogenic bacteria. Synthetic expression of active LL-37 in vivo is challenging due to the cytotoxic effects it has in the host. To make a resistant host that can export LL-37 to the media we intend to overexpress the E.coli acrAB and tolC operons, which activate the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump, a mechanism related with resistance to this and similar peptides by expulsion. To create a system in which E.coli expels LL-37 only in the presence of specific pathogenic bacteria, we use the LsrA promoter, which allows transcription in the presence of AI-2, a molecule produced by these bacteria to communicate via quorum-sensing. To avoid self-induction we designed an antisense RNA with specific secondary structure to inhibit the translation of LuxS, the enzyme responsible of the production of AI-2 in E.coli.

Due to the time constraint, the scope of the project is limited to a dual-state promoter where an acid-responsive promoter is placed upstream of a constitutive promoter. This novel transcription regulation element will have both constitutive and inducible activity. The construct will be tested by linking green fluorescent protein to the downstream promoter. Based on preliminary results, the extra promoter should allow for a significant increase in gene expression. These pieces have wide implications in any fields that require a quick upregulation of any gene in response to acidic environments.

Biological systems are not immune to this fact and must be continuously improved to function consistently, and reliably. Creating easy methods for tuning biological systems using light was the goal of this year's effort. Our team sought to improve on a previous light-regulated gene expression method, integrate the use of tablet device for testing, and create multiple functional biobrick constructs. In 2012, we developed an app that affords any researcher with access to an android device with a LED screen the ability to illuminate cells in a controlled manner for synthetic biology applications. We improved the functionality of the app by adding a mini petri dish setting and demonstrated the advantages of paralization by performing experiments in a 96 well plate format. This tablet application represents the first real life example of using a mobile device as synthetic biology instrument.

Alberta, Canada is faced with a specific challenge: the development of petroleum-related industries has led to large volumes of contaminated water, requiring extensive monitoring and remediation before the eventual release of this water back into the environment. Currently, methods of monitoring are either too slow, labour intensive, or inaccurately report on the toxicity of the sample. With increasing government regulation in the petroleum industry, the time for new technology is now. The 2013 Calgary Entrepreneurial team is advancing an electrochemical biosensor for petroleum-related toxins through our early venture: FREDsense. Using a unique sensing platform, our technology is faster, more quantitative, and capable of operating in environments where existing biosensors cannot. With collaborations in both industry and government, we are building better biosensors for the needs of the present, as well as the future.

Biofuels derived from corn-based ethanol and the microbial degradation of cellulose are not fully sustainable, due to the competition of food supply and expense of input energy. Cyanbacteria are bacteria with similar features as microalge in the sense that they are known to fix carbon dioxide into alkanes through the collective processes of photosynthesis, glycolysis, and fatty acid biosynthesis. The CAPS iGEM Team 2014 continues metabolic engineering of these pathways by expressing yeast-derived pyruvate kinase, known to be a key regulator of glycolysis, within the cyanobacteria Synechocystis PCC 6803 in an effort to increase alkane production. Assays for the production of pyruvate, fatty acids, and alkanes will be used to characterize our system. In addition, we will be determining various environmental conditions that increase the effectiveness of alkane production such as CO2 and O2 limitation.
https://teams.igem.org/1249	North America	Acne vulgaris affects around 85% of American adolescents. The four main causes of acne are comedogenesis, sebum production, proliferation of Propionibacterium acnes, and inflammation in the form of papules, pustules, and nodules. Triglycerides, wax esters, squalene, free fatty acids, and sapienic acid are the main components of sebum. Our team has created a biosystem that reduces the presence of sebaceous components (primarily wax esters). Our mechanism includes two proteins of interest-Medium Chain Alcohol Dehydrogenase and Medium Chain Aldehyde Dehydrogenase in two identical biological circuits to change the structure of wax esters and other lipids, rendering them insufficient for bacterial consumption. We included a basic promoter, RBS and terminator, making the protein-coding domain the only variable between the two circuits. We hope this mechanism facilitates sebum breakdown and reduces inflammatory responses of the P. acne bacteria.

Comparing to the traditional approach that relies upon restriction enzymes, a CRISPR-Cas9 based system offers several advantages including greater flexibility in silencing, enhancing or repairing gene expression, and the ability to introduce larger gene fragments. Our gene editing kit has three components: Guide RNA (gRNA), outer membrane protein of TMV homologous DNA sequences and CRISPR-Cas9 enzyme. The system was designed to have great compatibility with a wide range of organisms and easy to work with, and has been preliminarily validated by plasmid transfection in CHO cell line. With iGEM database in mind, the kit follows a modular design and aims to future iGEM projects with greater flexibility and compatibility in gene editing.
https://teams.igem.org/1253	High School	Telomeres are repeating sequences of TTAGGG nucleotides at the ends of somatic cell chromosomes. These sequences protect cellular genomes from harmful effects associated with chromosome shortening during cell replication. Due to the finite length of telomeres, telomere shortening is known to be a primary contributor to cellular senescence and cell death. To allow human somatic cells to replicate indefinitely, we have engineered a biological circuit with three primary components to regulate telomere length. (1) Expression of the reverse transcriptase enzyme telomerase to extend telomeres (2) Regulation of the amount of telomerase expressed using an oscillatory mechanism (3) Operation of a safety device to prevent possible cancerogenesis. Through the cooperation of these three mechanisms, and the tools of synthetic biology, lifespan extension is possible.

They especially thrive in developing countries, where the lack of advanced food storage and mycotoxin exposure causes 40% of the diseases. To lessen the problem, our team engineered E. coli strains using synthetic biology tools to produce chimeric mycotoxin-degrading fungal enzymes, Aflatoxin-Detoxifizyme (ADTZ) and Zearalenone Hydrolase (ZHD101), which are designed to be secreted to extra-cellular space by fusing with secretion signal peptides from alpha-amylase and beta-lactamase. In this study, we have successfully generated synthetic genetic materials to produce four chimeric mycotoxin-detoxifying enzymes. The levels of extracellular secretion is also characterized and analyzed. The project will allow a mass production of detoxification enzymes in cost effective way, preventing the squandering of harvested crops, and limiting mycotoxin-related diseases. Increased access to these proteins will have an immense commercial, industrial, agricultural, and health impact.

In order to work and test the different processes of the project, it was divided into four modules, which also made up the acronym of our projects name: Capture, Aroma, Resistance, and Union. Capture module is in charge of recollecting sodium ions in the water due to the new NhaS gen registered by the team. Aroma module is with the help of salicylic acid, responsible of producing a Winter Green odor that acts as a reporter if the bio-filter is working. Resistance module allows the E. coli to survive in the salty environment of the water, and this allows the bio-filter to works. Finally, the Union module allow the bacterium to joins to a silica pearl, which facilitates the removal of the bacteria from the water.

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) with effect against bacteria, viruses and fungi are small, cationic peptides that bind anionic membrane surfaces of microbes, resulting in forming channels or pores and leaking cell contents. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is an environmental bacterium with beneficial effects for plant growth. Several extracellular proteins such as proteases, lipases, nucleases, chitinases and elastases have been identified as decomposing enzymes. In the design of our genetically engineered bacteria, weve created biobricks of (1) AMPs (cecropin and magainin) to attack spoilage bacteria, and (2) several secreted decomposing enzymes directed by the secretion signal of E. coli OmpA to enhance the digestion of food wastes, as well as set (3) a self-destructive device inside to sacrifice when completing the mission, in which ccdB lethal gene expression is regulated by light.
https://teams.igem.org/1257	High School	The project aims is to degrade microcystin, a toxic substance produced by cyanobacteria. When cyanobacteria die, the cell walls collapse, causing the release of microcystins into water. However, microcystins happen to be extremely stable, so this means they are able to resist common chemical breakdown, such as hydrolysis, at natural conditions. It also breaks down very slowly at high temperatures (40°C), so the best way to deal with the problem is to use a bacterium that can break it down. However they arent usually found in water, so this allows the toxin to ravage the aquatic ecosystem. Our idea is to make a genetically modified organism that can break down microcystins. So, we will modify an E.coli bacterium to float at the top of a water column, where the cyanobacteria are located and to detect and degrade microcystins.

Although the WHO and EPA both recommend a maximum level of contamination of 10 ppb, many areas, like West Bengal and Bangladesh, have a much more relaxed 50 ppb. Arsenicosis, arsenic poisoning, has severe effects, including headaches, vomiting, hair loss, and skin lesions. Arsenic has also been known to lead to heart disease, stroke, cancer, and eventually death. A reliable biosensor would allow these areas to observe arsenic contamination. This inspired the WHHS iGEM to design a project similar and just as effective, yet with our own spin. Instead of pH, a pigment output would also be a viable method. Using the lycopene plasmids that were created by the 2009 Cambridge team, we are engineering an E.

In theory, many enzymes could be used, varying in function to break-down different molecules such as cellulose in plant-based stains, lipids in oil stains, starches in condiment stains, and so on. However, not all enzymes can be used, as the integrity of the clothing must be preserved and the user must be kept safe from harm. Some enzymes or solutions can cause epidermal damage or respiratory problems. Our goal, using the enzyme subtilisin, is to remove protein-based stains and create a substitute for potent chemicals with a green solution for the 21st century.

https://teams.igem.org/1261	Section	Kopi Luwak coffee is the rarest and the most expensive type of coffee in the world, and is processed from feces of the Asian Palm Civet (Paradoxurus hermaphroditus). As the coffee berries are digested, bitter components of the coffee bean are broken down. Later, the beans are cleaned, roasted, and brewed to make the Kopi Luwak coffee. The problem with the procedure today is that farming industries keeps tens of thousands of civets living in battery cages, and force-feeds them only coffee berries. As a result of the treatment, the Asian Palm Civet population is declining. We propose to make this process humane, efficient, and sanitary by instead using bacteria to produce the coffee. We will accomplish this by genetically engineering E. coli with genes for various digestive enzymes, thus simulating the digestive process of the civets with coffee berries so we can finally save the Asian Palm Civets.

Chitosan is derived from chitin through the N-deacetylation process. Uses include agriculture, medicine, and industry. Research in our local community led us to research applying chitosan in an agriculture setting by preserving post harvest fruit from fungal infections. Current technology to produce chitosan involves a caustic chemical process that is detrimental to the environment. An alkali sodium hydroxide removes the acetyl group from chitin to produce chitosan. Fortunately, this conversion process also takes place in the natural environment in a multitude of organisms through the aid of an enzyme called chitin deacetylase, or CDA. The main focus of our project was to obtain a CDA gene from a eukaryotic source, engineer a suitable vector with promoter, and transform into a bacterial host using the standard Biobrick assembly.

During the extraction of petroleum, oil spills are a potential risk, and contaminated soil is harmful to the agricultural industry. Xylene is not overly harmful in the concentrations naturally found, however benzene derivatives related to xylene are, which is why we test for xylene in our lab. Our prototype will involve using alginate beads, which are porous. The matrix is big enough to contain e.coli, but small enough to prevent bacteria from escaping. The XylR transcriptional activator is a protein which in the presence of m-xylene will bind to the Pu promoter which activates the reporter genes. We are attempting to use two reporters: GFP and amilCP. We are evaluating which of these reporter genes are the most convenient and efficient to use.
https://teams.igem.org/1268	North America	As Our Lady of the Snows first iGEM team, we have decided upon creating a heat-induced olfactory biosensor using E. coli as a chassis. Constructed by placing a wintergreen odor enzyme generator downstream from a heat sensitive promoter, the bacteria should emit a noticeable wintergreen smell starting near a human body temperature of 37°C. As the temperature increases the heat sensitive promoter gradually decreases the effect of the repressor to allow for maximum wintergreen enzyme generation around 42°C. The creation of this biobrick will serve as a first step towards a multiple input bio-sensing system. Such a system may include the input of heat and different wavelengths for activation. Both pursuits will help achieve the goal of using bacteria in increasingly complex circuits to more effectively sense the environment.

In order to fashion a more effective microbial fuel cell, we need to monitor the viability of bacteria within the fuel cell. Microbial fuel cells produce electricity and water when metal-breathing bacteria respire via an anode placed within an anaerobic compartment of the fuel cell. In order to monitor the health of these power-generating anaerobes, we designed an operon that will cause the microbes to fluoresce when growing in the oxygen-depleted anode chamber. Our operon consists of an oxygen-sensitive promoter, which activates gene expression in the absence of oxygen, and an open reading frame, which encodes a protein that fluoresces without the need for oxygen. This simple reporter system will allow us to determine when anaerobic conditions inside the fuel cell are optimal for bacteria growth and power generation.

We used a nahR gene, on plasmid NAH7 (BBa_J61051), which breaks down naphthalene in a cell environment into the more inert catechol. We then use the downstream element BBa_K118021, whose protein product, catechol-2, 3-dioxygenase, catalyzes the conversion of catechol to 2-HMS (2-hydroxymuconate semialdyhyde) a yellow-colored molecule. In addition, we created a cell that will be able to broadly identify other toxic fracking byproducts via a nonspecific SOS cell damage element. The promoter recognizes and binds to a combination of sequences of SOS repressor proteins produced after cellular stress from damaging toxins or radiation. This promoter (BBa_K518010) will be attached to a downstream element (BBa_K592009) coding for a blue-colored protein, so that bacterial cells exhibiting stress can be easily discerned.
https://teams.igem.org/1278	Section	Lake Xochimilco in Mexico City faces a condition of extreme pollution which endangers the endemic species; many of which are near extinction. Oxygen levels depletion in the lake directly affect the flora and fauna, making it less hospitable or even deadly. Our goal is to produce a biosensor that can easily and inexpensively detect anoxia in different regions of the lake. Using an oxygen promoter in addition with the biological markers RFP and GFP we could theoretically detect low dissolved oxygen levels in water samples. In addition, we intend to use a second construct with an Iron promoter to detect iron concentrations that also endanger the sustainability of living organisms in the lake. Once we identify critical regions of the Lake, our report could incentivate Civil Council and authorities to propose concrete legal initiatives to reduce pollution in the identified areas and start remediation campaigns.
https://teams.igem.org/1280	High School	Inspired by the olfactory ability of canines to detect diseases, we will pursue a long-term project that revolves around the creation of a minimally invasive and inexpensive detection system for lung cancer, through the identification of exhaled biomarkers. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death around the world. Twenty-two volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have been distinctly found in the breath of affected patients, creating a viable fingerprint for reliable detection (Horvath et al.). This year we focused on creating biosensors for three VOCs: ethanol, formaldehyde, and xylene. We plan to create genetic circuit systems for aldB induced by ethanol, frmR recognition of formaldehyde, and xylR activated by xylene. Our current device will utilize three reporter proteins (CFP, GFP, RFP) to indicate the concentrations of the three VOCs present in an exhaled sample. This research will eventually go into creating a conclusive test for use in the developing world.

Each year, the plant purchases 250,000 dollars worth of glycerin, which is used by bacteria to denitrify the water, in order to prevent eutrophication in the Chesapeake Bay. The UVa iGEM team from 2008 created a part which, when added, enables E.Coli to produce polyhydroxybutyrate, a biodegradable, bio-derived plastic. Our project is to make E.Coli that produces this plastic, which the plant could then use this bacteria to create polyhydroxybutyrate, filter out the E Coli, and then use the plastic as an alternative food source for their bacteria, saving them 250,000 dollars per year, as well as giving them a renewable energy source for their plant.
https://teams.igem.org/1283	Section	We design a bacteria that produces a wintergreen odor and protective melittin under extensive UV radiation. The biological system includes two generators: the UV-responsing wintergreen odor generator (BBa_K994000) and UV-responsing melittin generator. The melittin generator is composed of two transcriptional devices: RecA (SOS) promoter (BBa_J22106) and synthesized melittin gene with enterokinase digested sequence. The protective generator takes as input extensive UV radiation and produces as output fusion melittin. Melittin can improve immunity and scavenging free radicals to alleviate the harm from electromagnetic radiation, such as UV and blue light.
https://teams.igem.org/1285	High School	Carbon monoxide is a highly toxic gas which is undetectable by humans and it is fatal when inhaled. Weve developed a biological device that comprises of both a qualitative detector for this dangerous gas and a conversion system to transform it into carbon dioxide. As for detection, CO sensitive promoters pCooM and pCooF from Rhodosprillum rubrum will initiate the production of fluorescent proteins in the presence of CO. Optic sensors will be used to track the production of these proteins and if the sensors pick up data indicating that CO is present; an alarm will be triggered. Meanwhile, the conversion system of our device will utilize a Cyanobacteria enzyme called Carbon Monoxide Dehydrogenase (CODH), which converts CO into CO2. We also have a kill-switch design based on the lac-operon. The kill-switch mechanism will be activated to avoid any contamination of the environment, in case the altered bacteria escape the device.

We hope that our toolkit will simplify the process of plant cultivation and make synthetic biology accessible to peoples daily life. Hothouse plants whose preferential temperature ranges from 25~30&#8451; are exposed to the threat of low productivity and unhealthy growth in overly cold environments. Therefore, we came up with a system that aids the healthy growth of these plants by protecting them from overly low temperatures through smart temperature control. Our system of temperature moderation, including temperature sensing and temperature regulating, is able to produce heat once the temperature drops below 27&#8451; and stops heating when the temperature reaches 27~28&#8451;. In this way, the temperature is to be kept at 27&#8451;, ensuring the healthy growth and high productivity of hothouse plants.
https://teams.igem.org/1290	High School	Streptocccus Pyogenes is a severe bacteria which can result in some ilnesses such as pharyngitis. Diagnosis of S. Pyogenes can be done in some ways. However some ways are fairly expensive or takes more than a day to detect. We designed our system to solve this problem by using synbio. We simply found the sequence which can be cleavaged by the protease, SpeB, secreted by S. Pyogenes. In our system we used a wall protein which is linked to cleavage site by a sequence of linker. On the other side of the cleavage site, we located Catechol 2,3-dioxygenase(C2,3O) monomer. When cleavage site is eradicated by SpeB, free C2,3Os form tetramers. Catechol is a substance that reacts with Oxygene. As a result of this reaction yellow colour is produced. This system is fairly fast in comparison to blood agar method. The system can also be modified to detect other demerit bacteria.
https://teams.igem.org/1291	High School	Response systems possess great significance in the validation of designed systems in the current state of synthetic biology. This year we, team AUC_Turkey, focused on the improving of response system. In our appraisal, we recognized that it would perhaps be easier to degrade dye instead of producing fluorescent proteins or pigments. In our new response system, the module will primarily be transparent and will change color according to enzyme activity thus creating a distinction between the initial and secondary modules. The process will allow a relatively faster response through the cleavage of the enzymes. The usage of different types of enzymes will result in differentiation in the cleavage and through the examination of the color; it will be possible to make find an equivalent match on the scale. DegradEcolor will be a fast response system as an alternative to the most popular response systems
https://teams.igem.org/1292	Section	In April 2014, the World Health Organization released a report about the increasing danger of antibiotic resistance stating A post-antibiotic era  in which common infections and minor injuries can kill ... is a very real possibility for the 21st century. People continue to misuse antibiotics by not finishing their prescription, using them to combat inappropriate pathogens like viruses, and using them liberally in agriculture. When this happens, antibiotics can enter the water table. This selective pressure causes organisms in the water to adapt and become resistant to the antibiotics. Reducing the amount of antibiotics in the water supply will help to reduce this selective pressure. To remediate antibiotics in the environment we plan to generate a strain of E. coli that will export an enzyme known as Beta-lactamase to degrade Beta-lactam antibiotics. Ultimately, this will help reduce the selective pressure causing the evolution for antibiotic resistance.

Using urease test with the strain Klebsiella oxytoca Kctc 1686, we checked out the different results between urease-contained strains and non-urease strains. The work presented here has profound implications for future studies of synthetic biology and might help to solve the problems of desertification. We are planning to use Klebsiella oxytoca and type of free nitrogen bacteria to settle the environment that plants could live. First, Klebsiella oxytoca is a bacterium with the ability to precipitate calcite and solidify sand given a calcium source and urea, through the process of microbiologically induced calcite precipitation or biological cementation.
https://teams.igem.org/1298	High School	While mountain pine beetle are a natural part of the southern Rocky Mountain ecosystem, recent beetle outbreaks are larger than those of the past. Decades of fire suppression have created large tracts of older pine forest that provide a highway for beetle expansion. The lack of fire, combined with a recent warming trend, means that the beetles are now occurring farther east, farther north and at higher elevations than ever before. This is cause for concern as the mountain national parks form the margin between the beetle outbreak in British Columbia and commercial forests in Alberta. Our project will focus on building a bacterial plasmid that will produce and secrete the chitinase enzyme which will in turn be able to break down the chitin rich membranes of the BSF while leaving the tree unaffected and thus able to use its own defences to deal with the mountain pine beetle.

We have been dreaming a bioinformatics solution. Here comes the WeiGEM+, Wechat plus iGEM, which is a multi-functional public account that includes BioBrick search engine and iGEM articles. Biobrick search engine can be a useful tool for IGEM participants. With the Catalogs in the WeiGEM, users can search the ideal BioBricks by typing key characteristics in the text box. The science popularization part contains instant news on advanced science, including synthetic biology, life technology and brief introduction on previous works in iGEM and so on. Besides, human partice such as iGEM China meetup has been held by us in our region.

The team will build this kill switch with constructs consisting of a kill gene - a naturally occurring toxin: ccdB, a riboregulatory system, and a UV light inducible promoter. We plan on testing the riboregulatory system for efficiency of cell death. The success of inducible cell death would revolutionize the control over the unintended dispersion of GMOs.
https://teams.igem.org/1301	Asia	Recently, the number of Staphylococcus aureus that shows resistance to drugs such as penicillin and ampicillin has increased. The purpose of the lab is to investigate multidrug resistance of Methicillin Resistant S. aureus (MRSA), and to identify the genes involved. We tested the resistance of the transformed E. coli in different antibiotics and could conclude that MRSA showed resistance to antibiotics. We were able to get an idea of which of the DNA were involved in the multidrug resistance. By running PCR, we were able to amplify the DNA involved, and by analyzing this, we could come up with a better understanding of how the multidrug resistance works. An appropriate follow up on the project would be to research the sequence of the identified genes with the hopes of finding a possible drug that destroys even the most MRSA.

We come up with the idea that the long repeating sequence of the TALEs coding sequence leads to it. In our project, we attempt to construct a marvelous TALEs system which can efficiently work in prokaryotic organisms. By optimizing the TALEs coding sequence with modeling methods and testing it by Golden Gate Assembly and Report System, we hope we can have a handle tool for gene editing in prokaryotic organisms.
https://teams.igem.org/1312	Foundational Advance	This year, we have two projects. The first project is DMS (dimethylsulfide) synthesis. DMS is known to be a precursor of the cloud condensation nucleus. Some researchers say that DMS greatly affects the climate. Although the existing researches have already lined up the candidate genes of the DMS biosynthesis pathway, most of them are still unconfirmed. Therefore, we tried to confirm them by introducing 5 candidate genes in <i>Fragilariopsis cylindrus</i>; a diatom, into <i>Escherichia coli</i>. The second project is magnetosome formation. Magnetosome is a specific organelle in magnetotactic bacteria. Although many researchers have focused on it for its unique feature; magnetosome detect magnetic force, they have discovered only magnetotactic bacteria to have this ability so far. So we tried to form the Magnetosome in <i>E. coli</i> by introducing 4 operons which has been lined up recently as the sufficient genes to make magnetosome in <i>Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense</i>.
https://teams.igem.org/1313	Health & Medicine	The biochemical development of atherosclerosis is complex, and involves a variety of factors; it is intimately associated with hypercholesterolemia, smoking, obesity, and diabetes mellitus, among other conditions. One of the most accepted theories explaining its origin suggests that it is triggered by the chemical modifications of Low Density Lipoproteins (LDL), which are susceptible to oxdiations; it is believed that these oxidized products accumulate on the artery walls (tunica intima), generating an inflammatory process that will ultimately cause the development of atheroma plaques. LDL products are being oxidized by the interaction with Reactive Oxygen Species in the bloodstream, this can occur either within fatty acids or sterols, such as 7-ketocholesterol, one of the most common reaction products. We pretend to develop a new synthetic model capable of degrading the oxidized form of cholesterol by using gene therapy.
https://teams.igem.org/1314	New Application	Methane is a multifunctional gas that is used as fuel and an important carbon source. It is also used to make bio-degradable plastic.

An engineered nitrogenase (&#945;-70Ala, &#945;-195Gln) in <i>Azotobacter vinelandii</i> has been shown to have the ability of reducing carbon dioxide and carbonate into methane and other carbon compound. However, the carbon fixation process consumes a large numbers of protons and thus decreases the reaction rate. We propose to co-express hydrogenase III from <i>Aquifex aeolicus</i> to speed up the carbon fixation step in <i>A. vinelandii</i>.
https://teams.igem.org/1315	Health & Medicine	Cystic fibrosis is among the most common inherited disorders in Caucasian populations. It is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene and results in a thick mucus covering epithelia. This is particularly problematic in the respiratory tract, which becomes chronically infected with pathogenic bacteria. The Dundee 2014 iGEM project is focused on designing and testing a device that will rapidly and non-invasively identify these bacteria. We have developed biosensors to recognise signalling molecules that are released by the bacteria and can be detected in a patients sputum. The biosensors will be housed in an electronic device that can be used as a point-of-care test for a patients respiratory microbiome. The Lung Ranger is a portable tool designed to be faster and easier to use than current diagnostic techniques, allowing clinicians to make decisions about a patients treatment in a matter of hours rather than days.
https://teams.igem.org/1316	Microfluidics	Our team will develop a microbial based sensor ELECTRACE. The great innovation of our project consists on the biosensor's ability to produce a directly measurable electric signal as output. Electrical conductivity is a novel output that is orthogonal to all other standard outputs currently in use, such as fluorescence. In this way we will overcome the difficulties that arise by using conventional output signals, which are hard to quantify and to use outside the lab. The sensor-output system will be implemented in a microfluidics set-up, offering the possibility of designing a cost effective device that could be used at a large scale. ELECTRACE enables the interface between biology and electronics and fundamentally broadens the range of applications for synthetic biology. As a proof of principle, we will realize a system that is able to detect landmines. Additionally, the pathway that will be implemented can be extended to several other applications.

These biomaterials provide properties like high stress resistance and high elasticity. To produce these proteins, synthetics genes were engineered for E.Coli and it inspired by consensus sequences found in natural peptides, for elastin like polypeptides (ELP) the consensus sequence is VPGXG where X can be different amino acids, on the same way GPGXG, GPGGY and GPGGV were identified for spider silk like polypeptides (SLP) and finally for resilin like polypeptides (RLP) there is PSXXYGAP. Proteins are produce, after they are purified and freeze-dried to measure the dry-mass. Further soluble proteins are wet spin to obtain strings and test physicals properties. The final goal is to assembly ELP, RLP and SLP to create new polymers properties. The biobrick assembly method is used and optimized to combine fragments without stop codon to obtain new innovative proteins.

This protein will be on the same open reading frame than an antoxin, a protein able to neutralize the effects of the toxin. Stressed subpopulations might not express the PI (and thus the antitoxin) to a sufficient level, allowing the toxin to kill unproductive cells. Our work will consist on building and modelling this system.

Existing techniques pose limitations, as they do not combine effective, economical and rapid detection. The Cellock Holmes project aims to tackle these challenges all at once. By combining native microbial sensing systems, such as quorum sensing, with open source biology, hardware and software, a novel two-dimensional biosensor is developed. Cellock Holmes simple, modular and open design enables the end user to test solid surfaces for microbial contamination without any expensive equipment or highly trained personnel. The working concept is demonstrated using one of the most prevalent human pathogens, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>. The versatile biosensing system, however, can be easily customized to detect other pathogens as well.

Another issue is the efficient production of an alcohol that is effective as a fuel, easy and inexpensive to produce, and will function within the current infrastructure. This year, we improved the sensitivity of our Cadmium detector using sensitivity tuners. We are developing a strain of E. coli resistant to isobutanol and cloning GlmY, GlmZ and IlvM which are genes involved in the isobutanol production pathway . Addition of sensitivity tuners has improved the cadmium detector approximately 4-fold, from 10mM to 2.5mM, still over the federal limit. The isobutanol resistant strain of E. coli can tolerate 3 times as much isobutanol as the original strain. Finally, we have successfully isolated the glmZ coding region and have cloned it into the BioBrick vector.

We are optimising cellulose biosynthesis in <i>Gluconacetobacter xylinum</i>, transferring the system to <i>E. coli</i>, and functionalising the material using proteins in order to expand its properties and applications. Bacterial cellulose has seen use in clothing and health foods, but we develop its application to the global issue of water purification. Rising demand for limited freshwater supplies will lead to more than half of the global population suffering severe water stress by 2030. Improved filtration techniques would help relieve this problem. The inherent porosity of cellulose and our synthetic attachment of contaminant-specific binding and catabolic proteins make for a flexible, modular water filter. Our manufactured biomaterial would augment water recycling and reclamation on local and industrial scales, helping to alleviate global water stress.

From a single class of molecule, the terpenoids, come properties including agents with therapeutic qualities against maladies ranging from cancer to infection, antimicrobials, natural pesticides, rich flavorants, and fragrant scents. However, the utilization of these remarkable compounds has been severely hindered by their rarity in nature: many are found in only a small number of species and produced at levels measured in parts per million. Synthetic biology offers an opportunity to resolve this problem, by applying metabolic engineering in order to create cellular factories. Our project seeks to use the ideas of synthetic biology to develop a commercially viable strategy for the efficient production of a wide range of terpenoids.

They are well known for their resistance to all &#946;-lactams due to the expression of the mecA gene from the mec cassette. This year, the Waterloo iGEM team proposes to combat this infection by delivering gene-silencing systems: CRISPRi and RNAi through a Staphylococcus conjugative plasmid. This will effectively disable the antibiotic resistant phenotype over time so that a &#946;-lactam antibiotic can then be administered to kill the MRSA. As a proof of concept, our gene silencing mechanisms will target a YFP gene within a Staphylococcus population. We also propose to improve the efficiency of an existing conjugation plasmid so as to develop a more effective means of delivery between Staphylococcal organisms.

Recent studies found that more than 69% of the extra virgin oil sold in US supermarkets is rancid, while no inexpensive testing method is currently available to consumers. Our team has developed a rapid, inexpensive and accurate technique to measure oil quality. We have built an electrochemical sensor that incorporates engineered enzymes to detect a spectrum of aldehydes that serve as a proxy of rancidity. Computational analysis and custom hardware that includes signal filtering, processing and optimization of chemical kinetics allows us to perform multi-compound detection and hence olive oil quality control in a highly reproducible manner. Current and future collaboration with olive oil producers and distributors will pave the way for a widely-applicable platform with far-fetching consumer applications.
https://teams.igem.org/1325	New Application	BIT-China designed a genetic lock E.co-Lock in bacteria to keep important strains safe from ecological threatening or commercial loss even when they are accidentally leaked out or intentionally stolen. This bio-lock, likened to a digital combination lock, allows bacteria to grow only if three different inducers as password is put in order. To realize the code function three layered AND logic gates combined with sRNA system are built up. The corresponding sRNA selectively inhibits gene expression in AND gates to control the order of the password. MIN system is re-designed to inhibit cell division, which will be turned on to maintain the strain to a low density. In a word, locked bacteria are allowed to grow only when the input is correct; thus strains would remain low density and are effectively locked up. Therefore, commercially valuable or potentially hazardous strains will be under more strict control with different customized E.co-Locks.

Our conceptual approach is challenged by the creation of chimeric proteins and their functional assessment as relevant biotechnological and biomedical applications for the sake of humankind.
https://teams.igem.org/1330	Measurement	Since promoters are an integral part of every biological system, thorough characterization of promoters is a prerequisite for quick and robust construction of devices in synthetic biology. We have developed a method for measuring promoter activity in absolute units, that can be used to better characterize promoters. The method uses a fluorescent RNA reporter called Spinach and allows calculation of promoter activity in Polymerases per Second (PoPS). Furthermore the RNA reporter enables direct assessment of transcriptional activity without the factor of translational efficiency. In addition to this we have created a brainstorming exercise with the dual purpose of sparking an interest in synthetic biology among high school students, and providing the community with ideas for synthetic biology projects. Finally we have performed an analysis of the ethical issues associated with synthetic biology. All the efforts in our project have thus been directed towards advancing the field of synthetic biology.
https://teams.igem.org/1331	Energy	Microbial enhanced oil recovery (MEOR) is a popular method that relies on microorganisms and their metabolic products to mobilize residual oil. Rhamnolipid, a widely-used biosurfactant produced by <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> under aerobic conditions, is helpful in reducing oil-water interfacial tension, which makes it easier to remove oil. However, because of the anaerobic environment in oil reservoirs, rhamnolipid has to be produced ex situ, and then injected into the oil reservoirs. Our project is to build a bacterial strain that is able to utilize oil as its carbon resource as well as producing rhamnolipid in anaerobic environment. We start with a <i>Pseudomonas stutzeri</i> strain that lives in the oil reservoirs, clone and make it express the rhamnosyltransferase operon genes rhlABRI from Pseudomonas aeruginosa so that it can produce and excrete rhamnolipid into the oil constantly. With all the strengths enhancing the oil recovery, we name our engineered bacterium "Super Petroleum Magician".
https://teams.igem.org/1332	New Application	Generally, mRNA is single-strand RNA, starting translation by binding ribosome on initiation codon, and ending by separating ribosome from mRNA. In this study, we aim to build the method of synthesizing long-repeating proteins, massive&#12288;one, and to improve translation efficiency. That is, allowing ribosomes to have a semi-permanent translation mechanism by producing circular mRNA and causing a defect of termination codon. To cyclize mRNA, we can use a splicing mechanism of T4 phage. Splicing is a mechanism removing circular introns and joining in exons after transcription. Splicing is catalyzed by several base sequences at both ends of intron as a ribozyme, being subjected to nucleophilic attack from introns to exons. We would like to clone the two parts of intron to use this mechanism and cyclize mRNA, making plasmids which include a gene coding proteins between those. And, by transforming E.coli, we get worlds longest proteins.
https://teams.igem.org/1333	New Application	Current methods of high-affinity protein selection are time-consuming and laborious, which hinders the application process. This year, by constructing an integrated protein evolution machine, we made it automatic and efficient. A broad <b>diversification</b> was accomplished by a DNA mutagenesis module in the host bacteria, which enabled prototype protein sequence, carried by the budding-deficient M13 bacteriophage, to generate a library of candidate proteins. Subsequently, bacterial-two-hybrid system was used to give <b>selection</b> pressure on these candidates. Only the favorable candidate proteins can activate compensating gene transcription and rescue phage budding, thus enriching favorable protein sequence in the phage population. Moreover, an RNA thermometer, on the compensating gene mRNA, was applied in the phage <b>amplification</b> process to make it more controllable. Finally, by integrating all the diversification, selection and amplification process, our integrated directed evolution machine can make it an automatic and controllable process for high-affinity protein selection.

With the Twice Coloration System, we can know, from the color change, whether there is formaldehyde or not and whether the formaldehyde is eliminated completely. And the Street Cleaner System could change formaldehyde into water and carbon dioxide through several reactions with the help of specific enzymes. The Lysis System can help to split E.coli and release the enzymes into the reaction mixture, in which way it enhances the function of the Street Cleaner System. And with the help of all these three systems, we can detect and remove formaldehyde systematically.
https://teams.igem.org/1335	Measurement	Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a malignant tumor with 640,000 new cases annually worldwide. Saliva testing is non-invasive procedure that allows detecting OSCC biomarkers. Elevated level of p53 protein was identified in OSCC patients at different stages of the disease. Camelid antibodies containing only variable regions, nanobodies (VHH) and single-chain variable regions (scFv) with VH and VL, are becoming popular in research and diagnostics. It was identified that VL region showed higher affinity for p53 than VHH, and dimerization of VL regions increases their affinity up to ten folds. Camelid antibodies can be conjugated to other proteins without loss of function. They can be expressed and secreted in such common model organism as E. coli, reducing the cost of antibody production. Therefore, the aim of this project is to design biosensor to detect p53 in saliva samples for OSCC diagnosis using nanobodies expressed in bacteria.

During the dyeing process of materials, unbound azo-dyes are washed off into water bodies as industrial/wastewater effluent. Some azo-dyes, and their breakdown products, have proven to be of major environmental and health concern worldwide due to their mutagenic potential. The UCL 2014 team proposes harnessing various azo-dye degrading enzymes to create BioBricks for a novel Azo-Remediation Chassis (ARC). This would be capable of sensing, degrading, and decolourising azo-dyes, and ultimately detoxifying the breakdown products created. A bioprocess employing the ARC in an industrial setting has been developed and various modes of operation explored. This may serve as an end-of-pipe, lucrative addition to facilities expelling azo-dye contaminants. Furthermore, xenobiological approaches to biosafety are considered and a proposal for an azotrophic organism paves the way for a new era in synthetic biology biosafety.
https://teams.igem.org/1337	Community Labs	The London Biohackspace is a non-profit community biology lab where a diverse group of experts and newcomers alike create inventive projects. Our 2014 iGEM project is JuicyPrint, a 3D printer that is fed with fruit juice to print on demand 3D structures of bacterial cellulose. JuicyPrint has diverse uses across fields ranging from tissue engineering to textile design and experimental arts. JuicyPrint relies on a strain of the extra-cellular cellulose producing bacteria, Gluconacetobacter <i>hansenii</i>. The engineered strain is light sensitive, and grows on easily obtainable fruit juice. Our project uses Cph8 to insert a light dependent transcription regulation pathway into G.<i>hansenii</i> to control the transcription of <i>dgc1</i>, a gene necessary for the production of extracellular cellulose in G.<i>hansenii</i>.
https://teams.igem.org/1339	Environment	Many pesticides use neurotoxins that show toxicity not only to insects but also towards other species, including mammals.&#12288;We therefore set out to construct an E. coli that can safely eradicate cockroaches but not affect mammals. Cockroaches and many other insects store their energy in the form of trehalose and use the enzyme trehalase to convert it to glucose when needed. Our engineered E. coli will overexpress the enzymes OtsA and OtsB to produce trehalose, and glucose-3-dehydrogenase to convert trehalose to 3,3-diketotrehalose, an inhibitor of trehalase that is not toxic for mammals. Our engineered Exterminator coli will help eradicate roaches from homes without harming humans or pets.
https://teams.igem.org/1340	Software	Based on principles of design frameworks, this software provides you with smarter, more automatic designs. With standardized biobricks and databases, the software automatically joins parts and modules and consequently a system come into being. That is, after you define the inputs, outputs and logic between them, our software offers you with different solutions (that is, different mechanisms for the same effect) , the performance of each can be visible via a rader map. The built-in databases are abstracted from papers of considerable values of reference. It is far from finishing a design when a system comes out. Our software can mathematically simulate three major characteristics that describe the behaviour of the system: static performance, dynamic performance and expression efficiency, which might help you determine the performance of your designed system.
https://teams.igem.org/1341	Information Processing	The aim of our project is to build a brand new bio-navigational system that can be used by the ordinary people. The map information will be coded in DNA strand and do corresponding biochemical operations. The bio-navigational database will establish the relationship between biochemical operation instructions and traditional navigation instructions. In order to reduce workload in advance&#65292; BIO-COMPASS can also screen reaction conditions according to the road conditions. Furthermore, we try to update the system to adapt to the more complex path plans. For this, we design some special enzyme sites which differ from standard bio-bricks as the function interfaces. For example, Logic Gate genetic device can be inserted in our system to help us solve the path plan which include a transfer station between the start and the destination. BIO-COMPASS will find the best solution by using a variety of detection methods such as electrophoresis and reporter gene.
https://teams.igem.org/1342	New Application	<p>The chemotaxis is a phenomenon to take action with the directionality for the concentration gradient of the existing specific chemical substance around a straight object. </p> <p>We make various systems by using chemoattractant. We keep one function in one E.coli. This theory means to make simple plasmid. The following is one example. Wed like to collect cadmium in water. Therefore we use two kinds of E.coli. One catches Cadmium. The other attracts all E.coli by using chemoattractant. Catches E.coli displays metallothionein a protein combines a heavy metal. Cadmium is a kind of heavy metal. The other synthesizes aspartic acid (Asp) one kind of chemoattractant. All E.coli gather in the E.coli synthesizes Asp. To use these E.coli, finally Cadmium will be caught. </p>
https://teams.igem.org/1343	Information Processing	Our team is building a proof-of-concept computational network using E. coli cells for the detection of trace amounts of harmful substances, such as allergens in food. Each cell is an independent computational module programmed to execute instructions based on common input. They comprise bypassed toggle switches - mimicking transistors (the basis of any computational system), an interchangeable promoter serves as an input port, and a histidine kinase two-component signaling system fused to a sensor in the periplasmic domain will serve as a converter for other input signals. The independent modules communicate using quorum sensing to produce a unified output signal. We are chemically synthesizing a photo-switching molecule connecting the cells together, creating an artificial biofilm. The result is a network made of independent computational elements that upon detection of a substance, co-operate to provide the user with an output visible to the naked eye.
https://teams.igem.org/1344	Health & Medicine	Biofilm is a matrix extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) that is surrounding microbial collonies. It causes more than 65% of all microbial infections. Most of pathogenic bacteria could make biofilm that can cause antibiotic resistance issue and increase its pathogenecity. Our <i>Escherichia coli</i> can degrade biofilm from various bacteria after it seeks them by detecting their quorum sensing molecule. Our team will focus in <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> because it is a cause of cholera as a deadly tropical countries disease. We present our <i>E. coli</i> agent that can degrade biofilm of <i>V. cholerae</i> after it can detect quorum sensing molecule from <i>V. cholerae</i>, CAI-1, by CqsS receptor. Then our <i>E. coli</i> agent will activate motility gene, CheZ, to hunt <i>V. cholerae</i>. When it arrives, our bacteria will degrade the biofilm by secreting enzymes, such as &#945;-amylase, nuclease, and substilisin to break down the matrix and peptide 1018 that will kill <i>V. cholerae</i>.

https://teams.igem.org/1346	Information Processing	Cells in a local population have a wide range of responses to a given stimulus, potentially due to differences in extracellular environment or intracellular molecular composition. However, cellular communities often need to resolve this variation to respond in a concerted and robust way. Our project seeks to understand complex intercellular interactions underlying specific community phenotypes by engineering communication motifs with the goal of reaching a community behavior to either converge or diverge in response. To do this, we have engineered novel sense-and-secrete circuits into yeast. To model community signaling, we repurposed endogenous yeast mating factor alpha(MF&#945;) as an extracellular signal. Our designed circuit outputs initial individual responses to stimuli as GFP signal and, after signaling through secreted MF&#945;, a downstream community-coordinated response is reported as RFP signal. By tuning parameters like positive and negative feedback strength and MF&#945;-sensitivity, we hope to develop a circuit capable of analyzing cellular community interactions.
https://teams.igem.org/1347	Foundational Advance	In biological systems, changing from one state to another can depend on gene repression, induction of new genes, and degradation of previously used proteins. The ability to quickly and inducibly degrade a signal, repressor, or other protein would greatly improve the sensitivity and timing of biological switches. Auxin, a plant hormone, is involved in nearly every aspect of plant growth and development. In the presence of auxin, auxin receptors induce polyubiquitylation of a targeted protein, leading to degradation by the proteasome. This hormone based protein degradation has previously been used to create inducible protein degradation in yeast and mammalian cells. However, a parallel system  using jasmonic acid as the small molecule inducer  is also found in plants. Our goal is to use both the auxin and jasmonic acid responsive pathways to develop a quick, efficient, and bioorthogonal system to control protein stability in yeast.
https://teams.igem.org/1348	Art & Design	Synthetic biology is an emerging field which combines forward-engineering technology with that of conventional biochemical and molecular genetics approaches, also considered reverse engineering of terrestrial life systems. Since first established in 2003, the iGEM competition, a college level education platform, encourages the practice of genetic engineering using standardized function-oriented DNA fragments; in recent years especially, iGEM projects have become increasingly sophisticated, and some winning ones have reached the limit of logical reasoning and design. Our 2011 UST-Beijing team took the initiative of exploring horizontal gene transfer, by inserting a bacterial light-driven proton-pump into the inner mitochondrial membrane of cultured human cells. This year, for the 2014 iGEM competition, our UST-Beijing team will continue to analyze the transformed human cells, and make further proposals based on the unique observation of these experiments, in order to promote health and human welfare.
https://teams.igem.org/1349	Foundational Advance	The <b>S.E.colization</b> project focuses on synchronizing a culture of <i>E.coli</i> cells, so that they divide synchronously and change color from green to red and back as they go through the cell cycle. More specifically the culture stops dividing full of red cells and at regular intervals the cells turn green and divide before returning to the red quiescent state. To control the cell cycle, this project relies on a <b>re-engineered chemotaxis system</b> which instead of controlling the flagellar rotation direction drives changes in gene expression in response of the cell community through the use of a series of <b>on/off switches</b> and a <b>modified serine production pathway</b> which allows between cell communication. Introduced together, these different components will create an oscillator that regularly drives the switch modules between their two states which coupled to color changes will make the cells <b>GO</b> to the other state only when <b>the light is green</b>!!
https://teams.igem.org/1350	Environment	To enhance the effects of decontamination in various fields, we use an alkaline cellulase as detergent additive. The alkaline cellulase gene was introduced into the Escherichia coli and the target enzyme can be highly produced with the help of Kil, which is one of the core elements of our project. Whats more, MdfA, a proton pump across the cell membrane, was added to transport the proton into the cytoplasma, and release Na+/K+ at the same time, resulting in cell survival in alkaline industry wastewaters as high as pH 10. Another highlight of our project is that we also added a ccdAB suicide system to our e-machine, by this we could remove the biological machine whenever we need for biological safety.
https://teams.igem.org/1351	Health & Medicine	Increasing bacterial resistance to classical antibiotics remains a serious threat and urges the development of novel pathogen-killing strategies. Exploiting bacterial communication mechanisms such as quorum sensing is a promising strategy to specifically target certain pathogens. The major aim of this project is the introduction of a genetic circuit enabling <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> to actively detect, attach to, and eventually kill <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> and <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i>. Initially, we will introduce the autoinducer-sensing two-component systems of <i>S. aureus</i> and <i>S. pneumoniae</i> into <i>B. subtilis</i> to create a pathogen-detecting strain. By utilizing quorum sensing-dependent promoters, we will then trigger pathogen-killing strategies like the production of antimicrobial peptides or biofilm degradation. As a safety measure a delayed suicide-switch guarantees non-persistence of genetically modified <i>B. subtilis</i> in the absence of pathogens. We envision the use of BaKillus as a smart, cheap and simple-to-use medical device for diagnostics and targeted treatment of multiresistant superbugs.
https://teams.igem.org/1352	Village	<i>Trypanosoma.b. gambiense</i>, the causative agent of Trypanosomiasis (African Sleeping Sickness) infects 30,000 people worldwide, with 60 million at disease risk. Unrecognised, this disease is fatal, but accurate diagnosis, relying on detection of patient serum antibodies against two different trypanosomal antigens, allows successful treatment. We engineered autotransporters Ag43 and ice-nucleation protein to successfully express surface epitopes in <i>E.coli</i> that mimic two different trypanosomal antigens. Two <i>E.coli</i> strains were generated, each expressing a distinct surface epitope and either a quorum sensing (QS) sender or receiver module respectively. Immune pull-down of each strain, and their subsequent co-culture, produced a quorum signal, indicating successful detection of two distinct antibody populations in a serum sample. We constructed a cheap, Raspberry Pi computer-controlled fluorimeter suitable for developing countries, showing it could detect QS fluorescence output. This novel application of antigen display, and quorum sensing to implement AND logic sensing, facilitates cheap, simple diagnosis of tropical diseases.
https://teams.igem.org/1353	Software	Genetic circuits are often difficult to engineer, requiring months to design, build, and test each individual genetic device involved in the circuit. SBiDer, a web tool developed by the UCSD Software iGEM team, will leverage existing devices to construct a database with consideration for the function of each device interpreted as boolean logic. The data can be queried by the user through SBiDer's visual interface to explore circuit designs. The displayed circuit's literature reference, characterization data, and images of included devices can be viewed through the built-in table. Basic validation of the circuit performance is also provided within in the interface. SBiDer's web of information can be expanded through user-generated additions to the database to improve the efficiency of the application and the accuracy of the models.

As DNA synthesis continues to be a major bottleneck for R&D, our open source solution utilizes a novel enzymatic approach towards controllable *de novo* DNA synthesis; performed rapidly, inexpensively and less toxic than current methods. With speedy synthesis comes greater responsibility in industry towards biosafety; we propose the ultimate kill switch mechanism, a yeast-based chassis that features a programmable lifespan based on telomeres. Simplified DNA assembly will lead to a greater emphasis on pathway design and characterization in bioengineering programs. For schools, our "Biohacker Kit" utilizes a modular input/output binary plasmid platform that allows students to rapidly generate and test multiple biosensor configurations, with no cutting and pasting required. Additionally, inexpensive access to quality laboratory gear will be made possible by our Open Hardware collection of devices.
https://teams.igem.org/1355	Environment	Mercury (Hg) is a widely used metal in mining and industrial processes. Its easily spread in the environment and is considered a global pollutant, even reaching environments which have never been exposed to it. Among the contaminant metals, Hg is one of the most toxic and the only one able to undergo bio-magnification in most food chains. Besides, being the only known metal that causes human death through ingestion of contaminated aquatic organisms. To solve this problem, we used a bacterial mechanism of mercury resistance - operon mer - as inspiration. Mer operon is composed mainly by MerR, MerT, MerP and MerA proteins responsible for transport and reduction of mercury, being up regulated in its presence. Our project aims to develop contaminated waters treatment using mer proteins for bioremediation, attach a fluorescent protein for bio-detection and metallothionein for bioaccumulation in order to reduce damage caused by mercury in the ecosystem.
https://teams.igem.org/1356	WIKI	Wastewater facilities face challenges in effectively processing waste including residual antibiotics, excess nitrates, biofilm buildup and low survival rates of microbes essential to biodegredation. Using the native sludge bacteria Nitrosospira multiformis and Nitrosomonas eutropha as chassis we inserted genes to produce erythromycin esterase B and &#946;-lactamase to breakdown azythromycin and penicillin. We also inserted nirS, norB, norC, and nosZ from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 to convert nitrates into nitrogen gas, as well as genes to produce dispersin, amylase, and AHL-lactonase to inhibit biofilm formation. To increase bacteriophage resistance, prophage in the Nitrosospira and Nitrosomonas genomes were identified and used to build a guide RNA region for a Type II CRISPR system. By deleting the serA and serB genes we engineered serine auxotrophs to prevent release of our modified microbes. These improvements will help reduce antibiotic resistance, increase water reclamation, prevent algal blooms, and allow more biomass to be harvested.
https://teams.igem.org/1357	Environment	Microplastics, small plastic pieces with diameters of 5 millimeters or less which are present in commercial products and form from degrading macroplastics, are a growing threat to both public health and the environment. Our project design is centered on the creation of BioBricks that facilitate the formation of an E.coli biofilm that captures and degrades nylon microplastics. Biofilm formation is achieved through the overexpression of the transcriptional regulator NhaR, which increases the production of poly-beta-1,6-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (PGA). This exopolysaccharide creates a stable biofilm capable of adhering microplastics. Microplastics are then degraded by manganese peroxidase and nylon hydrolase that are secreted by the biofilm. Using these modified E. coli, our team designed a biofilter to effectively remove the threat of microplastics from water supplies.

With the help of these proteins, the pulp (which then becomes paper) can be bleached by much less chemical reagent, to save the environment. Nowadays bio-assistant bleaching method is becoming popular in paper making industry.<br><br>In our project, we build the parts for these three decolor-assistant proteins to assemble a decolor-assistant machine, and design experiments to see whether these three proteins have synergistic effect. We will also use different kinds of paper pulp to do experiments. Furthermore, we try to make a ready-to-use and user-friendly decoloring solution, based on our synergistic decolor-assistant bacteria.
https://teams.igem.org/1361	WIKI	Biosensors are becoming more and more indispensable tools in life science, medicine, chemistry and biotechnology. Yet in the bio-sensing procedure, the limitations of signal output methods restrict the usage and practicality of biosensors. Wildly used reporters such as chromophore and fluorescent protein which requires laboratorial equipments to measure often result in the loss of accuracy and immediacy. Thus our project is focus on the bio-signal transformation to diversify output methods of biosensor. Following this idea, we design a transducer which can convert the change of gene expression level that stimulated by inducer directly into the electric signal via inductive synthesis&#65288;or destroy&#65289;of nanowire between the electrodes. Curli fiber, a well characterized amyloid fiber which forms &#946;-sheet-rich amyloid fibers, seems to be an ideal foundation of our nanowire structure. CsgA, the modified morphon protein of curli fiber with the ability to bind nano gold particles, will play the role as the conductor.
https://teams.igem.org/1362	Foundational Advance	Biology works with networks of interacting proteins and controlling their functions is fundamental to Synthetic Biology. Conventionally, control depends on gene expression, however modifications made after expression enable fast and precise regulation. Our team has designed a universal toolbox for modifying proteins post-translationally utilising inteins and sortases. In the natural process of protein splicing auto-catalytic inteins excises themself leaving the flanking chains reconnected. Similarly, sortases identify, cut and rejoin protein sequences. Comprising a variety of standardised parts our toolbox can specifically change whole amino-acid sequences therefore regulating proteins via assembly or protein cleavage. Very curiously, these methods enable circularisation of enzymes rendering them thermodynamically stable and resistant to exoproteases, which will be applicable in biotechnological procedures requiring high temperatures. Our software selects the best technique for circularisation and a distributed computing platform facilitates the calculations. Taken together we provide a new foundational advance introducing full post-translational modification to Synthetic Biology.
https://teams.igem.org/1363	New Application	In this project, our aim is to design and construct a colorful bio-imaging system----Once you project a picture on engineered C.cresentus, they present the same image accurately, and its even flourescent! We took advantage of the nature of Caulobacter crescents (C.crescents), which is the ability to attach to a diverse range of surface by developing holdfast, to design circuits in C.crescentus in which light of different wavelength and intensity could trigger expression of corresponding florescent proteins as well as the enhancement of holdfast. So that C.crescentus can locate themselves correctly and present image colorfully. We also found that allosteric RNA operating as riboswitch is a promising alternative to proteins for synthetic chemical circuits due to its many distinct advantages such as rapid response and specificity. So we designed logic gates base on RNA switches to replace previous passway to create a faster C.imager.
https://teams.igem.org/1364	Environment	A threat, originated from the fungus Ceratocystis platani, affects the gorgeous plane trees in one of the most beautiful sites in Southern France named Canal du Midi. The Toulouse iGEM team is committed to protecting this UNESCO World Heritage site and has designed a bacterial cure named SubtiTree. This engineered bacterium derives from the natural Bacillus subtilis species present in the plane tree sap. SubtiTrees mission is to detect, bind and destroy the pathogenic fungus. First, a chemotaxis module directed towards the N-Acetylglucosamine released by the fungi confers the ability to head for the pathogen. Secondly, the bacterium binds to the fungal cell wall via a chitin binding domain. The final step is to kill the pathogen using an antifungal triple therapy. Different strategies are developed to control the spreading of our smart bacterium in the environment. SubtiTree opens new perspectives to vanquish many fungal associated diseases in plants.
https://teams.igem.org/1365	Health & Medicine	Infections caused by <i> Staphylococcus aureus </i> and <i> Pseudomonas aeruginosa </i> often pose problems for burn wound treatments. We developed a new kind of bandage that prevents these infections and reduces the use of antibiotics, thereby lowering the risk of developing antibiotic resistance. The bandage consists of a hydrogel that contains genetically engineered <i> Lactococcus lactis </i> with nutrients. The engineered strain of <i>L. lactis </i> detects the quorum sensing molecules of the two pathogens in the wound and subsequently produces the antimicrobial nisin as well as some other Infection-Preventing-Molecules (IPMs). These IPMs are the anti-biofilm protein Dispersin B and the quorum quenching protein AHLase. The gel is placed between two layers, a top layer to allow diffusion of gases and a bottom layer to contain the bacteria within the bandage. Hydrating the gel by breaking adjacent water pockets initiates the growth of the bacteria, thereby activating the bandage.
https://teams.igem.org/1366	Health & Medicine	By harnessing the inherent ability of facultative anaerobic bacteria to colonize and grow in tumoral environments, this project aims to develop a bacterial cancer therapy. A genetically modified <i>E. coli</i> will have knockouts in the <i>lpp</i> and <i>msbB</i> genes, which encode for the Brauns lipoprotein and for the myristic acid moiety transporter of the lipopolysaccharide respectively. These genes are known to trigger an immune response in the human body; by deleting them, the impact of a bacterial intravenous administration will be reduced. Furthermore, these bacteria will produce M13-modified bacteriophages under the control of a quorum sensing system. They will be able to bind to cancerous cells, internalize and transfect them with two different genes: apoptin, responsible for an apoptotic protein specific for cancerous cells and a survivin siRNA. The latter will inhibit the uncontrollable growth characteristic of cancer cells, making them more vulnerable to apoptosis.

The diseases caused by HPV (Human Papilloma Virus) and can be prevented by natural antioxidant consumption, such as tea that has epigallocathecin gallate (EGCG). Precancerous changes of the cervix can be seen with Pap smear test and colposcopy. However, the detections procedure cause uncomfortable and depending on oncologist.Therefore, UB-Indonesia team developed a Cervical Cancer Care + (C3+) to prevent the cervical cancer epidemic. First project, we have developed very simple detection kit for HPV DNA based on colorimetry and equipped with detection software-based of mobile phone applications. The software will suggest user for next step to do according the detection result. Second project, we developed siRNA to over-produce EGCG on tea.Third project, we have developed a robust Screening Cancer Therapy kit (SCT).The SCT provide easy tool to discovery particular drug based on HPV type or personalized patient character for cervical cancer treatment.
https://teams.igem.org/1368	Information Processing	Standardization is one of the greatest features in synthetic biology. However, synthetic biologists meet obstacles when combining parts and modules to create more sophisticated systems using the standardization principle. In our project, we created some modules to reintroduce the conception of "adaptability", which is one intrinsic characteristic of natural living systems. Processing modules can alter the way they process information in order to adapt to environmental changes. The circuit we designed can rewire its connections between parts and devices to implement multiple functions with the help of site-specific recombination systems. Host overload and unexpected interplay between modules are prevented in our design. Besides, we designed a post-transcriptional control in the input module and an RNA-level fluorescence in the output module to make the system work effectively. Our design may lead to a forward step towards system integration in synthetic biology.
https://teams.igem.org/1369	Foundational Advance	While there exist many well-characterized genetic circuits in synthetic biology utilizing intracellular genetic regulation, the implementation of methods governing intercellular regulationthat between two different cellshas lagged behind in comparison. To investigate the viability of independent, non-interfering cell-to-cell signaling, we attempted to implement non-endogenous bacterial quorum-sensing systems from various Gram positive bacteria in <i>E. coli</i>, in hopes that successful transfer of these systems into <i>E. coli</i> will promote enhanced prototyping of intercellular signaling and regulation in synthetic biologys favorite model organism. To this end, three separate quorum sensing systems<i>agr</i>BDCA, <i>lam</i>BDCA, and <i>fsr</i>ABCwere investigated. We constructed various cell strains expressing separately the signaling and receiving components of the quorum sensing systems and measured their efficacy in creating and receiving the signaling molecule. Treatment of hormonal regulation disorders (e.g. diabetes, Cushings disease, etc.) is one of many possible applications of successful creation of circuits implementing intercellular regulation.
https://teams.igem.org/1370	Village	The goal of this year's project is to genetically modify Cyanothece to allow it to fix all forms of nitrogen oxide pollutants in coal flue gases. Coal is one of the primary sources of global energy and produces carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxide pollutants, among others, which contribute to global warming and acid rain formation. Fixing nitrogen through Cyanothece has another benefit besides reducing pollution; the end products are ammonia compounds which are a major component of fertilizer. We hope this will allow power companies to offset some of the costs of cleaning their emissions by selling the ammonia products to be made into fertilizer. We will be isolating the nitrogen fixing genes and adding them to the BioBricks Parts Registry for the Jamboree.
https://teams.igem.org/1371	Manufacturing	Polyketides are a class of secondary metabolites produced by almost all living organisms. These are structurally complex organic compounds that are often highly active biologically. Many pharmaceuticals are derived from or inspired by polyketides. For the heterologous expression of polyketide synthases(PKSs), the main method of the technology is transferring full gene cluster into heterologous host strains. However, such method cant synthetize various polyketides by the same polyketide synthase domains. This year, we are dedicated to using PKS domains as a synthetic unit to diminish the size of the target gene fragments. Meanwhile, the host strain E. coli should be genetically modified in order to enable the synthesis of the corresponding substrate. In this way, PKS domains can be assembled more quickly, enabling the programmed polyketide synthesis. In addition, we can design synthesis pathway of polyketide independently. This system can select the corresponding synthesis polyketide synthase domains to synthetize polyketide programmedly.
https://teams.igem.org/1372	Art & Design	Synthetic Biology has the power of changing paradigms of society such as our conception of what living beings are. If we deprive bacteria from their unnecessary" functions and have them produce what we need, do these bacteria still possess the status of living organisms or have they become machines? To raise this question, we adopted an artistic approach, as Bio-Art is one of the best way to spark debate with citizens. We create a concept organism that would reflect these interrogations. We modify Escherichia coli to produce the scent and simulate the ripening process of a lemon. A mixture of bacteria and growth medium will be molded: it will smell, ripe and look like a lemon, but "ceci nest pas un citron - this is not a lemon or is it? With this we invite everyone to think about the upcoming opportunities and the ethical limits of designing living beings.

We knocked out the arcA gene, over-expressed the nadE gene and incorporated the porin OprF in cell membrane in E. coli. These modifications released the inhibition of metabolic enzymes in anaerobic condition of ArcA protein, also boosted up intracellular NAD+(H) level for higher electron transferring rate and provided membrane channels for electron exchange, by which the electrogenic capacity of the MFC was collectively enhanced resulting in a high efficient seawater desalination in MDC system.

https://teams.igem.org/1375	Information Processing	Our project is focusing on using the simple prokaryotes to imitate the nerve system which exists in the advanced animals widely. As we all known, the nerve system of advanced animals like human consists of 3 major parts: the receptive neurons, the central neurons, and the effector cells. Correspondingly, we separate bacteria into 3 different communities to execute different functions and we name these 3 communities as Receptor, Transmitter, and Effector. In details, we replace the neurotransmitter by AHL family and in the meanwhile, we construct the multiple promoter to simulate the procedure of signal receiving and processing. In addition, for the sake of achieving the signal transmitting and analyzing, we isolate a new cell quorum sensing systemthe PPYs signal pathway from photorhabdus luminescence. The mechanism of this PPYs signal pathway is similar to the AHLs pathway.

When a node is selected, our software can quickly form a net with the nodes close to it. When a gene sequence is provided, such as a BioBrick part, our software can use homology method to predict the impact it gives on the gene regulatory network. Furthermore, the software provides users with various interfaces so that the entire network, or a part of it, can be exported into corresponding format which can be imported into other professional softwares for network analysis.On this platform, users can create, modify and complete different biological networks based on the information they get from online collaboration.
https://teams.igem.org/1377	New Application	Our project is to construct a novel protein whip platform, with which we can make Corynebacterium glutamicum to express other corynebacteriums pili structure comprised of chains of our interested protein. As our first try, we decided to make pili made out of green fluorescence proteins (GFP); we substituted SpaA protein, one of the surface proteins in the pili gene cluster, into GFP, and transformed a vector containing the modified pili gene cluster into a C. glutamicum. protein whip platform has many practical applications. For example, pili made out of an enzyme, enzyme whip will enable the reaction to take place with high efficiency. Biofilms made of bacteria that express pili comprised of histidine or cysteine that readily bind to heavy metals may be utilized to purify water contaminated with heavy metals. By using C. glutamicum instead of Escherichia coli, our project contributes to expanding model organisms used in synthetic biology.
https://teams.igem.org/1378	Environment	Widespread water bloom leads to extensive damage in ecosystems. Compared to physical or chemical methods, biological treatment for water bloom is less expensive and more environmentally friendly. Hence Peking iGEM is dedicated to constructing engineered microorganisms for the elimination of algae and recovery of ecosystems. A specific antimicrobial peptide is secreted to disrupt the outer membrane of algae. In addition, we equip our transgenic cells with features that allow for buoyancy and attachment, making our project more efficient. During this process, an enzyme is also secreted to degrade a deleterious product of algae. After eradicating the algae, our engineered bacteria will commit suicide, and the ecosystem is finally restored. This project is an innovative treatment for water bloom, and has potential applications in the field of ecosystem remediation.

To provide an affordable solution to combat pneumococcal diseases, we are engineering an <i>E. coli</i> Pneumosensor, that will work inside an in vitro diagnostic device. Through this cheaper and easier diagnosis method, people can prepare themselves better against the transmission and adversity of <i>S. pneumoniae</i>. Pneumosensor has a rewired <i>comCDE</i> signal transduction pathway native to <i>S. pneumoniae</i> that detects autoinducer molecules released specifically by <i>S. pneumoniae</i>. It is also equipped with a new promoter for the specific and tight regulation of target gene expression in <i>E. coli</i>. In addition, the team is documenting and characterizing existing CR-TA riboregulators for post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Our work will provide information for other iGEM teams to incorporate this tuning tool into their project design.
https://teams.igem.org/1380	Food & Nutrition	The stimulant theobromine is an alkaloid found naturally in cocoa trees and chocolate. Due to metabolic inefficiencies, canines cannot digest theobromine as quickly as humans can, thus leading to an excess of the stimulant in the gastointestinal tract. Even small amounts of chocolate can induce toxic side effects such as nausea and even death in canines. However, by manipulating theobromine via N-demethylases, it can be metabolized into xanthine, which is much safer for animal digestion. By repurposing a previously characterized caffeine degradation operon into Lactobacillus plantarum, we aim to create a probiotic that can sustain theobromine N-demethylation while simultaneously colonizing canine guts. We will also incorporate modeling with our experimental data to determine the feasibility of our novel probiotic strategy.
https://teams.igem.org/1381	Health & Medicine	Destabilized ecosystems and disturbed gut floras are both consequences of treatments that lack selectivity. More efficient and precise methods are needed. This year we, the Uppsala iGEM team, tries to widen the view and find new possibilities with engineered bacteria. By developing a system that homes towards a target and secretes an affectant, we can ensure a specific outcome. Such a system could have applications in a number of different fields, though we have chosen to put this into practice in a pinpointing pathogen-killing approach. In our prototype system, introduced in <i>E. coli</i>, we hijack the quorum sensing system of the gut pathogen <i>Yersinia enterocolitica</i>. Our bacteria will be able to sense the presence of the pathogen, accumulate in its vicinity and emit a target-specific bacteriocin, leaving the remaining gut flora intact. The era of mass destruction is over. Welcome the missile bacteria, the Bactissile!
https://teams.igem.org/1382	Health & Medicine	Pathogenic bacteria are becoming increasingly antibiotic-resistant, even to last-resort antibiotics. In addition, infections caused by some harmful strains of bacteria, such as <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, cannot easily be treated with antibiotics or other common forms of treatment. We propose a strategy against this sort of resistance which uses the bee venom compound melittin to target pathogenic bacteria. Our intention is to engineer cells which can both produce our compound and recognize the communication signals of <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, allowing our system to maintain some target specificity. Two plasmids, one which controls the production of melittin and the other which acts as the cell-signal receiver, will be inserted in <i>E. coli</i> cells. When melittin is released, it can then insert into the outer membranes of a bacterial cell, creating pores which then cause cell lysis.
https://teams.igem.org/1383	New Application	When beginning research in synthetic biology, the go-to organism is the bacterium <i>E. coli</i>. Our research demonstrates the utility of a methanogenic archaeon, <i>Methanococcus maripaludis</i>, as an alternative platform. Our two primary focuses in this study are: 1) improving the genetic tools for synthetic biology available in archaea and 2) demonstrating the utility of archaea in synthetic biology through production of geraniol. Previously, a synthesized gene encoding geraniol synthase was expressed in <i>M. maripaludis</i>, and geraniol production was quantified as 0.2% of lipid dry weight using GC/MS. In order to optimize geraniol production, we are experimenting a combination of chemical, biological and computational approaches that include: an improved geraniol extraction procedure resulting in better recovery, a fluorescent protein monitor for protein expression and regulation, a synthetic ribosome-binding-site library enabling variable levels of expression, and a metabolic model of the lipid biosynthesis pathway subjected to flux balance analysis.
https://teams.igem.org/1384	Manufacturing	Spiders have evolved an arsenal of silk threads for various applications, using combinations of highly-repetitive silk proteins. These fibers have an extremely high range of tensile strength and elasticity, and along with their low immunogenicity, are desired by the military, medical, and fashion industries. However, spider silk farming is impractical, and alternatives are necessary for large-scale production. Inspired by natures design, we aim to engineer E. coli to produce genetically programmed synthetic fibers, and standardize the customization of their physical and functional properties. We have adapted Iterative Capped Assembly to modularize and flexibly control the assembly of silk domains that confer strength or elasticity in specific ratios. Varying the composition of the silk genes, or adding other functional proteins will allow precise fine-tuning of the resulting properties, and expand their practical utility. This platform can be readily applied to assemble other highly-repetitive proteins, or large genes from libraries of parts.
https://teams.igem.org/1385	Environment	We have a nitrogen problem. The atmosphere has a bunch; our crops need it to grow, but they rely on nitrogen fixing bacteria in the soil to utilize it. To keep up with our population growth, farmers are more dependent on inorganic fertilizers (which can be expensive, inaccessible, and harmful) to enrich the soil and increase yield. If only we could engineer crops to fix nitrogen! Endosymbiotic theory states that chloroplasts in plants originally came from a symbiotic relationship between prokaryotes. A certain cyanobacterium, <i>Cyanothece </i> sp. 51142, can photosynthesize and fix nitrogen within the same cell. Another photosynthetic cyanobacterium, <i>Synechocystis </i> sp. 6803, has light activated proteins. Our project is to study the systems in a simpler environment by expressing nitrogen-fixing genes in <i> E. coli,</i> and to work on a light repressed system for gene expression, because the nitrogenase enzyme is poisoned by oxygen, a product of photosynthesis.
https://teams.igem.org/1386	Village	The war on microbial pathogens is a complex issue, and will continue to be in the foreseeable future. Antibiotics target microbes once they have invaded their host, but this practice cannot continue forever due to bacterias ability to become resistant to the drugs administered. Here, we describe a novel use of recombinant biotechnology to generate <i>Escherichia coli</i> capable of both sensing and reporting the presence of pathogenic bacteria, by taking advantage of a pre-existing contact-dependent inhibition system. Coupling this contact-dependent system to gene control allows us to create a reporter bacterium that will glow on contact with pathogenic bacteria, exposing potential pathogens before they have a chance to infect their host. Dealing with post-infection situations will always be a necessity, but early detection and prevention will certainly lighten the load on an already strained scientific and medical community.&#8203;
https://teams.igem.org/1387	Environment	PET or commonly known as plastic has been widely used in various application. We cant deny that plastic give us a lot of benefit, though overproduction of plastic could give serious impact for the environment if not treated properly. The total of global plastic is estimated to exceed 24.39 million tons in 2015; therefore, appropriate treatment is necessary. To solve the problem, we try to degrade plastic using synthetic bacteria. We establish ompA protein fused with LC-Cutinase in Escherichia coli BL21 thus exposing the degrading enzymes on the surface membrane of bacteria. We also construct a cassette comprised of glycoaldehyde reductase and glycoaldehyde dehydrogenase which responsible in metabolising ethylene glycol as byproduct of degradation. We use constitutive promoter for both construct, thus making it necessary to create a modul of reporter and self regulatory to maintain system efficiency and minimizing severe cytoplasmic stress from formation of inclusion body aggregate.
https://teams.igem.org/1388	Foundational Advance	Integrons are systems that can capture and utilise mobile genetic elements known as gene cassetes, and which are found in a vast array of bacteria, often associated with antibiotic resistance. Gene cassettes with an attC recognition site are site selectively recombined into an attI recognition site by the integron integrase. We are seeking to design biobrick compatible integron components that can be used as a novel, convenient and selective cloning system in lab strains of E. coli, which normally do not contain integron systems. Additionally, we are investigating regulation of natural transformation mechanisms in E. coli in an attempt to allow uptake and recombination of attC containing genetic elements with added convenience. This will include investigating the role of the transcription factor sxy, as well as other components of the DNA uptake systems of other gram negative bacteria that are naturally transformable.
https://teams.igem.org/1390	Environment	Milk cows and cattle are important factors in global warming: In their rumen, billions of microorganisms release greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane as they help digest the animals food. Even though this is a natural process industrial-scale farming intensifies the situation. Therefore, finding ways to decrease production of such gases damaging to climate is essential. Considering the 25 times greater contribution to global warming compared to CO2, methane emission is a substantial point of action for future climate protection. In order to achieve this, we are going to engineer a bacterium in a way that it is able to render methane harmless just as it originates in the cows rumen. The bacterium shall be equipped with the 6 subunits of the monooxygenase (MMO) out of Methylococcus capsulatus turning methane into a natural intermediate of the cellular metabolism so that no methane is released into the atmosphere.
https://teams.igem.org/1391	Health & Medicine	Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by the aggregation of beta-amyloid oligomers in the brain. These cause neuron death and disrupt the proper functioning of surviving neurons. Despite the severity of the disease, Alzheimer's diagnosis and treatment are limited to post-symptomatic psychological methods and so there is great need for molecular detection and alleviation mechanisms. To address this, we have genetically engineered a system to diagnose and treat Alzheimers disease. Diagnosis is based on the detection of two Alzheimers-specific biomarkers in the brain: extracellular beta-amyloid protein oligomers and the intracellular miRNA profile of afflicted neurons. Successful detection triggers a treatment module that reduces beta-amyloid levels, thereby preventing neuronal death and slowing the progression of Alzheimers symptoms. This research demonstrates an approach that could inform an eventual treatment, not only for Alzheimers disease, but for numerous other human afflictions.
https://teams.igem.org/1392	Environment	The usage of Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) like plastic bottles is one of the biggest problem of our era. Many plastic bottles are not reusable. Some tougher, reusable plastic bottles may cause cancer. The main disadvantage of plastic bottles is that so many of them end up in landfills instead of being recycled. It takes hundreds of years for plastic bottles to biodegrade, and the degrading process emits toxic chemicals into the air. We may alter the destiny of plastic in useful way. Our project aims to keep the environment clean with the degradation of PET to pyruvate by E. coli. With this project, while the environment will be cleaned from PET, the E. coli would add pyruvate to the cell cycle and use it as a new energy source for itself. We will biodegrade PET to Catechol. Then catechol to 2-hydroxymuconate resulting in pyruvate.
https://teams.igem.org/1393	Environment	As a result of industrialization, heavy metal pollution has become a serious problem in the world and copper can be extremely toxic to human body. The excessive cellular amount of Cu ions can readily interact with oxygen, resulting in the generation of hydroxyl radicals which lead to harm. The typical disease caused by copper is called Wilson Disease, which has become a world concern. A rotating biological contactor (RBC) is a biofilm-based reactor technology widely used for wastewater treatment. In our program, we combine heavy metal meditation with RBC and developed a toolkit gathering Cu ions from polluted water, degrading the cyanide, detoxifying the fluoride and suggesting whether the water is safety in terms of copper amount. Our bacteria stands out with the character of accumulating everything in favor and eliminating things with hostility, which is similar to a famous Chinese historical warlord called Cao Mengde.
https://teams.igem.org/1394	Manufacturing	Star-shaped peptides are a promising biomaterial being proposed for use in nanomedicine. While star peptides have conventionally been synthesised <i>in vitro</i>, the University of Melbourne iGEM team aims to use the peptide-synthesis machinery of <i>E. coli</i> to produce these peptides <i>in vivo</i>. To this end, star peptide precursors will be expressed and purified from <i>E. coli</i> and then reacted to form stars. The arms of these stars may be functionalised with various biomacromolecules, including peptides and proteins. By incorporating various molecules in the star arms (e.g. antimicrobial peptides or anticancer drugs), the star peptides may be applied in a variety of biomedical contexts as drug delivery vehicles or macromolecular linkers. The project notably blends synthetic biology and synthetic chemistry, contributing to both fields by developing a bacterial platform technology for peptide-based nanoparticles.
https://teams.igem.org/1395	Environment	The effects Global Warming has attracted the attention of the major stake holders of the world who believe that the need of the hour is to combat the levels of the toxic greenhouse gases emitted. With increase in the number of automobiles and industries, the emission of harmful greenhouse gases mainly nitrogen and sulphur oxides increases leading to global warming. We plan to build a model involving synthetically engineered E.coli, which is compatible to all the possible exhaust mechanism due to its scalability. We genetically engineered NrfA , Cys1 and SQR genes in E.coli which would help in converting SOx and NOx from the exhaust gases of automobiles and chimneys of industries to harmless compounds.Our model is optimized for the efficiency of the reduction of nitrogen and sulphur oxides without compromising on the growth and manufacturing productivity of the industries.
https://teams.igem.org/1396	Manufacturing	Biofilm formation on surfaces is an issue in the medical field, naval industry, and other areas. We developed an anti-fouling peptide with two modular components: a mussel adhesion protein (MAP) anchor and LL-37, an antimicrobial peptide. MAPs can selectively attach to metal and organic surfaces via L-dopamine (L-DOPA), a nonstandard amino acid that was incorporated using a genomically recoded organism (GRO). Because this peptide is toxic to the GRO in which it is produced, we designed a better controlled inducible system that limits basal expression. This was achieved through a novel T7 riboregulation system that controls expression at both the transcriptional and translational levels. This improved system is a precise synthetic switch for the expression of cytotoxic substances in the already robust T7 system. Lastly, the antimicrobial surface-binding peptide was assayed for functionality.

https://teams.igem.org/1399	Foundational Advance	The Edinburgh team is introducing a newly invented inter-cellular communication method to iGEM, called Metabolic Wiring. This signalling method uses intermediates from metabolic pathways as signalling molecules, and is superior to the conventionally used quorum sensing due to improved orthogonality, wider range of signalling molecules available, and extensibility. Our project aims to implement the system in Escherichia coli and adapt it to BioBrick format. We will develop three metabolic wires using aromatic degradation, sugar degradation, and cis-genic wires. To demonstrate its potential, the three wires will then be implemented in a population control system and used to regulate the growth of a single bacterial strain in a mixed population, depending on the population sizes of the remaining strains. Stability of composition of the bacterial populations can thus be increased and more complex biochemical reactions enabled. We will also attempt an alternative use of the wires in an intracellular genetic circuit.
https://teams.igem.org/1400	WIKI	Cellular decision-making is the process by which cells assume unique, functionally different states, to address various needs of an organism. However, due to a lack of well-characterized devices capable of producing multiple states, the design of organisms with multiple changing functionalities has been hampered. This year, we have engineered yeast that can make multiple decisions based on environmental cues and indefinitely maintain their state until conditions change. We will achieve this by implementing a synthetic cellular decision making transcriptional network: the tri-stable switch. We have designed and tested new dual input promoters that use transcriptional activators as both activators and repressors. We have also generated a mathematical model of our system from our constructed promoter characterizations, along with continuing with our outreach program to elementary and high school students. We believe that by emulating cellular decision making mechanisms we will, one day, be able to manipulate existing systems.

With a pinch of wet lab work and a dash of computational tools, we have developed a new recipe called Chimera that will help fellow synthetic biology cloners in the creation of their genetic devices! Chimera utilizes bio-design automation software tools with experimental protocols and builds upon a thoroughly characterized library of MoClo parts. This recipe, or workflow, integrates software tools to reduce human error and to structure the way device designs are chosen, assembled, and tested. To demonstrate that this workflow can be used by any level of cloner (beginner, intermediate, and advanced), we will highlight how we used Chimera to create [1] individual genetic parts (namely tandem promoters, fusion proteins, and different backbones), [2] transcriptional units assembled from individual parts (with both new and previously made MoClo parts), and [3] a complex genetic device (our goal is a priority encoder).
https://teams.igem.org/1402	Energy	Fatty acid(FFA) plays an essential role in many aspects of modern society, such as food industry, rubber industry, fuel, etc. Relied on animal grease or plant oil currently, the FFA production, however, is highly restricted by seasonal, regional factors and the expensive manufacturing cost. Therefore, we strive to transform E.coli into a biological factory that produces more FFAs of different length of carbon chain and saturation levels in both an efficient and a controlled manner. To achieve that, we will introduce FFA desaturase and various thioesterase, key enzymes for unsaturated FFA production and FFA synthesis respectively, and different operon structure into the engineering E.coli. Also, we design a fluorescence system composed of Transcriptional Regulatory Protein FadR to monitor the FFA producing status in E.coli. In this case, we can produce different FFAs by applying different signals to operons in E.coli and detect the real time production status by fluorescence report.

One of the objectives of our project is identifying and isolating natural mutants that have non-functional odor-producing enzymes using CRISPRs. We're also engineering bacteria to degrade smelly molecules: TMA (trimethylamine) and 2-nonenal. The old people smell is mainly due to 2-nonenal. To degrade it, we want to perform directed evolution on skin bacteria. TMA has a fish odor and it appears in people suffering from trimethylaminuria. We will clone the enzyme trimethylamine monooxygenase, which degrades TMA, in E.coli and skin bacteria. Parallelly, we intend to develop a set of primordial odors by cloning enzymes known to catalyze reactions yielding volatile compounds. We're also focusing on scientific communication, for that, we are developing an online course developed on the Education Genius platform about iGEM high school.
https://teams.igem.org/1404	Environment	The INSA-Lyon team is developping an E. coli-based platform as an alternative depollution method for metal contamination in water using an amyloid-display system for surface-functionalization, called CurLy'On. As far as France is concerned, drinkable water contamination from the metal pipes is a real issue. Indeed, the cost is estimated to twenty billion euros to fully replace the existing infrastructure. Using our system based on nano-sponge surfaces for water purification, we propose to extend this concept into a cheap bacterial filter as a solution. Indeed, the use of surface-specific protein particularly benefits the biotechnology research field, and extensively the synthetic biology field, in depollution alternative strategies but also in the medical field by improving the dialysis filter specificty on various metals for renal-insufficient patients.
https://teams.igem.org/1405	Environment	Nitrogen fixing ability of rhizobium is significant for the growth of grass family. The stronger of its ability, the less chemical fertilizer will be used. Molybdenum is a key integral part of nitrogen fixing enzyme in rhizobium and Mo is also important for the growth of plants themselves. However, Mo is heavy mental. The abuse of it will cause environment pollution. Hence, spot application of Mo is of great importance. A plasmid was transfer into E.coli Promethus to make it express fusion protein, one side of which anchors on the out membrane and the other side of which,ModA,catches molybdate. With the help of organic acid tendency system, our Promethus will head for the roots. A suicide system depending on time is also design for the reason of bio-safety. E.coli Promethus will deliver Mo directly to the root of plants. This will also open a new chapter of biological fertilizer.
https://teams.igem.org/1406	Food & Nutrition	In parts of the world suitable land to raise grazing animals is limited so these animals are either not raised or are malnourished. Animals can get more nourishment from a smaller amount of land if they increase digestion efficiency by converting more sugar polymers (cellulose) from plants into usable sugars. We aim to construct an <i>Escherichia coli</i> strain capable of secreting cellulose-degrading enzymes in an animals gut. This strain will contain a plasmid that expresses the bglS, yesZ, and xynA genes from <i>Bacillus subtilis </i>that code for three enzymes that cleave different bonds in cellulose. These enzymes will be secreted from the well-studied probiotic <i>Escherichia coli</i> Nissle 1917 cell by a Type I secretion system whose genes are also engineered into the plasmid. In raising animals with this engineered bacterium, we hope to increase the amount of available calories for nutrient-deprived populations while having minimal effects on established cultural practices.
https://teams.igem.org/1407	Measurement	In recent decades, human have stepped out to explore the universe. Astronauts have been sent to outer space. In the meantime, how to prevent radiation harm has become a serious problem that demands promting solution. Our project focuses on establishing a more portable, accurate and economical biosynthetic system to detect the dosage, and to provide measurement precisely to guard human from being hurt by invisible radiation. We assembly gene circuits in E.coli, which function as radiation detector and reporter individually. Meanwhile, we design bi-switch circuits for the detector, a quorum sensing circuits for reporter and a linkage between the two. Once the detector senses radiation by the damage, the linkage auto-inducer molecules will drive the reporter to produce light and digital signals. We firmly believe that this biological-activity-based detector system is more sensitive, and has more significant influence in measuring the level of harm by sensing the dosage of radiation.
https://teams.igem.org/1408	WIKI	Stabilizing proteins is an incredibly important and time consuming task in the field of protein engineering. Our team has developed a high throughput method to select for the increased expression and stability of engineered proteins, making them more amenable to large-scale production in Escherichia coli and other downstream applications. Our method involves the insertion of proteins into a Gal4-VP16 transactivator that binds a promoter directly upstream of a GFP gene. This allows for the subsequent selection of mutants associated with higher GFP output, correlating to higher stability, using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Additionally, our method utilizes degrons to alter the dynamic range of this GFP output. This revolutionary method is a potentially generalizable alternative to current, labor intensive approaches for the selection of stable protein variants. Engineered proteins selected through this method could be produced in bacteria and aid in the development of thermostable, de novo protein therapeutics.

The tools we are creating with this project will enable future study of calcium in bacteria and yeast, as well as create a groundwork for future genetic circuits to be created to study calcium in these organisms, and, eventually, in multicellular organisms.

The team will first determine the perception of biotechnology undergraduate students through a survey developed for this purpose. Second, we will coordinate and conduct education and information activities with children and youth using synthetic biology activities with the goal to publicize scientific and timely information about this technology. Finally, we will conduct a risk analysis of the E zamofordi organism by the Cartegena Protocol and the Environmental Risk Assessment of genetically modified organisms guidelines (ERA). With these we will scientifically demonstrate that the project ¨Know your enemy¨ complies with the established norms of biosafety. If handled according to relevant regulations, as an alternate product through the extrapolation of this evaluation, this is a simple tool for future risk analysis applicable to Central America.
https://teams.igem.org/1412	Foundational Advance	Pattern formation is a hallmark of coordinated cell behavior in both single and multicellular organisms. It typically involves intercellular communication and intracellular signal processing, which requires different configurations of sender cells and receiver cells. Pseudotaxis provides us a new way to reprogram chemotaxis. Here we design gene circuits based on <i>E.coli</i> pseudotaxis, which is capable of forming conic curves governed by precise mathematical principle. We introduce orthogonal experiments to figure out the most impact factor of pattern formation. We use computational modelling to explore the laws of pattern formation and pattern changes over time on semisolid medium. Therefore, the precise control of pattern formation under mathematical principle lays the foundation for the development of regulators efficiency characterization, tissue engineering, targeted therapy, 3D printing ,biosafety and fabrication of biomaterials.
https://teams.igem.org/1413	Environment	Our team wants to heighten awareness about environmental pollution and particularly its devastating consequences on the aquatic life. In this line of thinking we are driven to design a bioremediation tool to decrease the marine pollution and protect aquatic ecosystems. We aim at tackling elements of the main pollutant families by focusing on 5 toxic agents: Polychlorinated Biphenyls, nitrite, phenol, lead and cadmium. The bioremediation tool will be based on Pseudovibrio denitrificans, a bacterium living in symbiosis with Spongia officinalis. Our goal is to engineer the bacterium to detect, signal and degrade/capture pollutants and to bring it as new chassis in the iGEM competition. The projects originality lies on the duo formed by Pseudovibrio denitrificans and its symbiotic sponge. Combining these two organisms allows for safe containment of the engineered strain while the extensive filtration capacity of the sponge stimulates the optimal sensing, signaling, and capturing of pollutants in water.
https://teams.igem.org/1414	Health & Medicine	Acquired immune system is one of two main immunity strategies in vertebrates. In this system , Helper T cells work mainly. Th1 cells and T&#65352;2 cells keep balance mutually, and two cells usually control immune response. When this balance collapses and became the Th2 predominance, IL-5 is secreted excessively from Th2, and eosonophil,basophil,and mast cells are activated by IL-5. These activated cells secrete inflammatory materials that cause allergic symptoms such as bronchial asthma and atopic dermatitis. On the other hand, by stimulation of IL-12, naïve T cell differentiates into Th1 cell and Th1 cell alleviates allergic symptoms. We though it is possible to ameliorate allergic symptoms by decreasing IL-5 and increasing IL-12. Focusing on ligand dependent dimerization of IL-5 receptor ,we try to make IL5 independent expression system .
https://teams.igem.org/1415	Environment	Insect damage brings significant loss to modern agriculture and obstructs agricultural development. Most conventional treatments have harmful side effects, such as pollution and drug resistance. Currently, the use of pheromone traps is one of the cleanest methods to specifically attract and kill insects. Instead of carrying out the complex biosynthesis pathway of pheromones, we choose the simple act of expressing the DNA sequence of Pheromone Biosynthesis Activating Neuropeptide (PBAN). PBAN is similar to pheromone in its species-specificity. Once a specific PBAN comes in contact with and stimulates the target species, specific pheromones will be emitted to attract more of said species. In our project, we have successfully constructed and expressed in E. coli PBANs of nine different species and also built a capturing device. Hopefully this model can be widely used in the future when PBANs of more insects are found.
https://teams.igem.org/1416	Measurement	Expansion of the genetic code has the potential to add novel functionality and chemistry to biology. Typically, expansion occurs via reassignment of the amber stop codon. When reassigned, this codon results in incorporation of a non-canonical amino acid (ncAA) not normally found in proteins. Such ncAAs can grant new functionality, including photocrosslinking, photocaging, novel bonding or binding sites, and fluorescence. One part of our project creates an Expansion Pack Reporter Kit. This kit uses a fused fluorescent reporter, containing an N-terminal RFP domain, a C-terminal GFP domain, and an amber codon-containing linker sequence that connects the two domains. While the RFP domain is translated and fluoresces under all conditions, the GFP domain is only translated when the ncAA is incorporated within the linker. Failure to incorporate the ncAA leads to translation termination, and thus no GFP fluorescence. This allows us to accurately assess the rate and fidelity of ncAA incorporation.

Coli to other non-model organisms chosen for their promise in other fields of research. All processes take place in a cell-free system to provide a consistent characterization platform. This information is useful in synthetic biology applications for healthcare, the environment, and industry as it provides a basis for DNA design in organisms other than E. Coli that are more optimized for the needs of a given application. An example of a non-model organism that we are using with the cell-free system is <i>Streptomyces</i>, which has played an important role in antibiotic production. While we explore adaptation of the cell-free system to these non-model organisms, we also strive, through characterization of sets of promoters and RBS, to create a combination that would yield the maximum protein production.

Even though they are relatively harmless to humans, laundry detergents contain caustic chemicals and reagents that have a detrimental impact on the environment. Our aim is to use enzymatic means of cleaning to reduce the amount of detergent necessary for normal washes as well as increase the efficiency of stain removal. We have engineered <i>E. coli</i> to produce enzymes that can be used to remove laundry stains such as grass, starch, and oils. By functionalizing these enzymes on a bioplastic material that can be used as an additive to traditional laundry cycles, we hope to improve the sanitation of clothing and other washable materials. The demonstration of enzyme functionality after biological immobilization will create a platform for future teams to display enzymes relevant to other applications.
https://teams.igem.org/1419	Health & Medicine	Stroke and neurodegenerative disease collectively cost the Canadian medical system millions of dollars annually while effective neural regenerative therapies remain elusive. Astrogliosis, a cellular response to such neural insults, leads to the formation of a non-functional glial scar and an inhibitory cellular environment that impedes neural regrowth and recovery. Our project involves engineering microglia, the mobile immune cells of the brain, to package and deliver a therapeutic plasmid specifically to central nervous system cells. The plasmid encodes a reprogramming factor that converts reactive astrocytes into new neurons, helping to restore the functional neuronal population and permit regrowth of damaged connections. We have also developed a novel plasmid selection system that bypasses antibiotic-based selection to reduce the size of the reprogramming plasmid. This project has the potential to provide a novel, non-invasive rehabilitative therapy that could lead to significantly improved functional recovery following brain injury or disease onset.
https://teams.igem.org/1420	WIKI	Mercury is a neurotoxic heavy metal with the ability to biomagnify, and is a significant issue in public and environmental health worldwide. Rising levels of mercury due to mining activities, industrial catalysts, agricultural fungicides, and the burning of fossil fuels has resulted in the pollution of many ecosystems and water reservoirs. Cleanup of mercury contamination using current technology is either not feasible or incredibly costly. This study describes the engineering of recombinant bacteria that can facilitate the bioremediation of the neurotoxic methylmercury and mercury ions into less toxic form, and reduce other heavy metals. This synthetic microbe was encapsulated within a cost-effective, scalable water filtering device. Device employment could rigorously change the practices used in mercury decontamination efforts by switching to biological rather than chemical processes. Furthermore, this technology can be applied towards bioremediation and biosensing of various heavy metals and organic toxins in the environment.
https://teams.igem.org/1421	New Application	We move the frozen power from Disney to E.coli. We construct E.coli to express RFP to draw a dynamic pattern of snowflake. Once we kindle a spot, the pattern starts and grows up gradually. According to our design, two kinds of E.coli with partly different genetic pathway align alternatively. The two kinds of E.coli interact through two independent quorum sensing systems, LuxI/LuxR/AHL in vibrio fischeri and RpaI/RpaR/pC-HSL in Rhodopseudomonas palustris, while neither of them influencing themselves. A plate for E.coli culture is divided into rectangular grids and every cell in the grid is occupied with a colon of E.coli. On-state shows as red fluorescence while off-state shows as nothing illuminating. To kindle the system, we only need to add correspondent signal molecular to the central 4 colons of E.coli in a plate. Finally, there will be a snowflake with red fluorescence starts to grow up from a point automatically.

A solution is presented by utilizing synthetic biology to engineer Bacillus subtilis to increase plants ability to uptake iron, through production of plant phytosiderophores. Phytosiderophores are small, high-affinity iron chelating molecules that many microorganisms and plants use to increase bioavailable iron by reducing Fe3+ to Fe2+. Our genetically engineered system combines five corn genes to produce these phytosiderophores: SAMS, NAS1, NAATI, DMAS, and TOM1. We are using corn and rice to confirm that plants grown with our engineered bacteria will have higher iron content than plants grown with wild-type Bacillus or with no Bacillus at all. Mass spectrometry, chlorophyll readings, and height measurements were used to determine the effectiveness of our engineered system.
https://teams.igem.org/1423	Health & Medicine	Just this year, in a vote held for the Longitude Prize, antibiotic resistance was voted the most pressing issue of our time. One of the biggest causes of antibiotic resistance lies in the farming industry; more than 3 times the amount of antibiotics given to humans are administered to livestock. Over-prescription of antibiotics promotes resistance in both livestock pathogens and natural flora, which can be transmitted to humans through meat and other products. A cheap, quick, and reliable mechanism for detecting and identifying infection is one solution to this problem. We developed an E.coli based cell surface antigen expression system that can be utilized as a diagnostic tool for nearly any viral, bacterial, or fungal infection. The recombinant E.coli are utilized in a direct agglutination test using the host organisms serum. Our team successfully demonstrated the feasibility of this diagnostic tool using a GFP antibody and antigen pair.
https://teams.igem.org/1424	Village	The changes observed in the global climate within the last hundred years have been attributed to rising atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide (CO2). This heavy increase in atmospheric CO2 is thought to be caused by the heavy industrialisation of our civilisation with the use of fossil fuels. With the potential impact climate change could have for many ecosystems globally, it becomes apparent we need to slow-down, if not prevent these changes in order to preserve our current habitat. One strategy for reducing the CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere is biological carbon fixation. The project undertaken will look at establishing the lactate inducible expression system into Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Once established, glucose oxidase (GOx) will be incorporated into this expression system. It is proposed that Glucose oxidase will prevent respiration of the organism, thereby increasing its carbon fixation capacity.
https://teams.igem.org/1426	Village	Regulated gene expression is one of the primary means by which phenotypic differences are generated among genetically identical cells (e.g., endothelial cells versus nerve cells). Nonetheless, the concept of inducible gene expression is often difficult for students to understand. To help students gain a better understanding of inducible gene expression, we developed "BactoArt", a multicomponent, inducible expression system that allows students to visualize gene regulation in action. First, different fluorescent protein (FP) color variants (e.g., CFP, GFP, or RFP) were placed under the control of specific inducible promoters. The inducers can then be patterend onto a petri dishusing either a paintbrush or an inkjet printerbefore plating BactoArt bacteria, leading to selective induction of a given FP. We simultaneously induced GFP and RFP from pXyl and pLac, respectively, and measured their fluorescence intensity over time. We believe that such hands-on activities will spark questions, leading to "teachable moments" about transcriptional regulation.
https://teams.igem.org/1427	Health & Medicine	A long, noncoding massively expressed regulatory RNA (merRNA) discovered in Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus is present in high levels during its dormant phase. The merRNA is believed to sequester cyclic-di-GMP, much like a sponge. Since cyclic-di-GMP is a second messenger for various cellular functions, including motility and biofilm formation, the Tufts iGEM team introduced this merRNA sequence into E. coli. Constitutive expression of this merRNA transcript was shown to increase biofilm formation. This property can be useful in microbe-based approaches to environmental remediation. Earlier designs for phage delivery of the merRNA to disrupt biofilms inspired an investigation into the policy surrounding engineered bacteriophage. Tufts iGEM will be convening a panel of experts from various disciplines to put forth recommendations for the responsible use of phage in therapeutic and industrial applications. A proposal will be drafted for a silk bandage containing a phage cocktail which can prevent and treat infection by antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
https://teams.igem.org/1428	Village	It is well-known that prokaryotes do not have cytoplasmic compartmentalization. However, certain bacteria possess gene clusters that encodes five to six small, structural proteins that self-assembles into a hollow, icosahedral-like organelles called Bacterial Micro-Compartments (BMCs). We constructed a flexible plasmid with various features that allows convenient, customized functionalization of these microcompartments, both externally and internally. As a proof-of-principle project, we also attempted to purify the neo-functionalized BMCs and test their biological activity both <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>. Based on our generalized system, there would be more interest in utilizing this remarkable evolutionary product for multiple biotechnological applications, from solving environmental issues, to medicinal applications, or even metabolic engineering and novel scientific research tools.
https://teams.igem.org/1429	WIKI	The Open Lab is a key step towards democratization of synthetic biology. It is the complete set of knowledge, tools, and resources required to successfully develop a thriving community biolab, all created following open source principles. The project has four parts. 1) The Open Lab Blueprint, a website guide to launch and develop a sustainable community biolab. It includes the following components: starting up a lab, physical space, acquisition of key equipment, and efficiently implementing safety, standards and best practices, community-building, generating content and sustainability. 2) Open source equipment development in the form of a liquid handling robot, customizable with shareable protocols. 3) Set of IP-free fluorescent protein genes in open plasmid backbones to be made available to citizen scientists in the form of a starter activity kit. 4) Bioglyphics, a visual protocol design tool to lower the barrier of entry to synthetic biology practice, especially geared toward visual thinkers.
https://teams.igem.org/1430	Health & Medicine	Our aim is to develop a diagnostic technique capable of detecting the presence of fungal pathogens in a sample collected from a patient. Briefly, our approach is as follows. Through a yeast two-hybrid assay we will select a set of peptides that show affinity towards surface proteins from different fungi (Aspergillus nidulans, A. fumigatus, Candida albicans and C. glabrata). After confirming the interaction between the surface proteins and a given peptide, we intend to attach a molecule to the peptide marker. In our project, this molecule will be a fluorescent protein, but in principle can also be an immune system activator which is then recognized by the immune cells or other chemical moiety that adds novel functionalities or increases the peptide stability.
https://teams.igem.org/1431	Health & Medicine	In this project, we want to establish a more effective HIV-curing system with less side-effects by integrating CRISPR/Cas system into human hematopoietic stem cells, which aims to protect the helper T cells from virus infection. The gRNA is designed to target the relative conserved regions in HIV viral genome and inactivate its biological activity. Since viral vectors seem to be of limited use in gene therapy strategies (e.g., potential pathogenicity), there is still a need for a simple, efficient nucleic acid transfer system which allows the target-cell-specific introduction of nucleic acids. By using non-viral DNA delivery system like A-B-toxin-GAL4 fusion protein, we can deliver plasmids encoding gRNA into the helper T cells and readily attack multiple HIV genome sites simultaneously and update the targets along with our knowledge of HIV.

Therefore, we strives to explore simple methods for detection of this toxin and finding ways to alleviate water pollution caused by this toxin. During algae bloom break out, a strain of Pseudomonas expresses a series of proteins, named Mlr, that could decompose algal toxin.we use E.coli instead of Pesudomonas to improve the expression of Mlr proteins and constructs a system to detect the contents of toxin in water and early alarm the algal bloom. If Microsystin LR is our enemy that poisons aquatic organisms and human body, then the engineering bacteria act as the intelligent scout and sniper for this freshwater toxin.
https://teams.igem.org/1433	Foundational Advance	The assembly of genetic circuits is a huge obstacle between designs and achievements in synthetic biology. Many well-known methods, from traditional restriction digestion & ligation, 3A assembly to Gibson assembly, aim to overcome the difficulties but unfortunately get respective defects. This year, ZJU-CHINA seeks to build a gene-insertion system in bacterial chromosome, "GeneSocket". Clearly different from the in vitro constructing methods mentioned before, GeneSocket, which can be easily combined with existing in vitro methods, makes gene expression more accurate, stable and controllable by assembling genetic elements in chromosome directly. Two core methods, lambda red recombination and recombinase-based bistable switch, are applied. Both are the best choices for achieving the characteristics of GeneSocket. We hope that by using GeneSocket, synthetic biologists can turn their theoretical design into reality faster and better. We want to lead to the revolution in techniques of synthetic biology!
https://teams.igem.org/1434	Food & Nutrition	Obesity is a growing problem in todays society. Our project aims to engineer a novel treatment for obesity. By modifying the natural CRP pathway, we will turn the commensal bacterium Escherichia E.coli Nissle 1917 into a sugar sponge that will absorb excess carbohydrates before they can be taken up in the human intestines. Our engineered bacteria is aimed at obese people who have tried other approaches to weight loss, but have failed to see any results. Other uses could include patients who need to lose weight before surgery. The bacteria would be delivered in the form of a pill or yogurt drink. Our project will include an in-depth sociological analysis of modern attitudes to obesity based on research and data collected from surveys, exploring public opinion regarding body weight as well as synthetic biology and genetic modification. We have used the results to direct our engineering strategies.
https://teams.igem.org/1435	Village	Found across all domains of life, inteins are protein elements capable of autocatalytic splicing. This phenomenon, termed protein splicing, allows inteins to be a point of control in forming mature and functional protein products. Current genetic circuits are limited by transcriptional lag, rendering them limited in applications which require fidelity and responsiveness. Inteins represent an innovative solution to improving the sensitivity of biosensors and synthetic circuits circumventing this lag and controlling the output of the circuit at the protein level. Here, we have created an intein toolkit, designed to introduce and facilitate the use of inteins in future iGEM projects. We have engineered several inducible intein switches capable of being activated by common environmental triggers as well as small molecules. To showcase the utility of inteins, we have also developed an intein based system to tackle mitochondria disease by allotropically expressing and transporting mitochondria proteins using inteins.
https://teams.igem.org/1436	Software	RNA interference (RNAi) is a one of the post-transcriptional gene expression regulation process. The process occurs physiologically, but it can also be employed in biological research. RNAi reagents such as siRNAs, shRNAs and sh-miRs (also called artificial miRNAs or sh-miRNAs) are widely used in molecular biology. They can be used in basic research or in therapeutic approaches for genetic diseases. sh-miR designer is user-friendly and fast software for sh-miR design and in silico validation. In sh-miR designer v2.0 only the mRNA number (from NCBI database) can be provided to predict molecules targeting desired transcript. Moreover, we expanded functionality of the software with off-target validation and immune motifs presence verification and also extended the miRNA-shuttles database. With sh-miR designer we automated the tedious and time-consuming process of sh-miR design.
https://teams.igem.org/1437	Environment	Dioxins are commonly regarded as highly toxic compounds that are environmental pollutants and persistent organic pollutants. Its deleterious hazards intensify with the odorless, colorless and fat- soluble properties, which enable dioxins to accumulate in vivo thus threaten almost the whole biosphere. To detect dioxins blisteringly, we have constructed device for rapid detection of dioxins inside yeast. We utilized associability between the gene for testing dioxins of MOUSE as receptor and dioxins as signal, together with the regulation conducted by lexA operator to downstream promoters so that the fusion protein combined bydioxin receptor and lexA can induce downstream gene with the presence of dioxins. Eventually, we can achieve our goal of detecting dioxins rapidly through the system of positive feedback of fluorescence. We additionally design a secretive gather part by emulsifying protein to add the soluble ability of dioxins and anchoring the dioxin degradation enzyme on the surface of the yeast.
https://teams.igem.org/1438	WIKI	As the first iGEM team from Berlin, we decided to construct a simple BioBrick that enables synthetic biologists to remotely control the movement of E. coli. A seemingly simple and non-invasive mechanism for this remote control is the use of magnetic fields. By altering the iron homeostasis of E. coli, we want to increase the total iron level of the cytosol. By sequestering iron in a ferritin protein, iron crystals are formed and the cell is detoxified. We will work with other metal binding proteins such as metallothioneins and phytochelatin synthases in order to create ferromagnetic crystals. Furthermore, we will search for the optimal conditions which yield the most efficient formation of magnetic nanoparticles in E. coli. Once we have discovered the best way to magnetize E. coli bacteria, we will build and characterize suitable BioBricks that can be used to remote control the cellular movement of E. coli.
https://teams.igem.org/1439	New Application	<p>Generally, researchers transfer plasmids from prokaryote to eukaryote by non-autonomous methods. While we manage to make plasmid transfer by autonomous and convenient methods. Hence this year, OUC-China iGEM devotes to design a novel model of plasmid transfer. Because the plasmid cant transfer into natural bacteria easily in vivo. We transport the plasmid with double plasmids system into the organism, and then the constructed plasmid that has lysis device can transfer to the dominant colony in organism by conjugation. Afterwards, the dominant colony with constructed plasmid can lysis and release the constructed plasmid and a fusion protein composed of cationic TAT peptide and histone H4 that we has designed. The protein complexes will carry the constructed plasmid into eukaryote to make molecular operation. The project is to construct a novel model method of eukaryotic transfection for molecular biology research at individual level such as DNA vaccine and molecular marker.</p>

Our team design and create a new kind of genetic logic circuit in mammalian cells based on "tet-shRNA expression system" and "Cre-tamoxifen system" ,which can implement all 16 boolean logic gate functions ideally. And our team will use the circuit for creating a pathway for cell transdifferentiation and reprogramming.
https://teams.igem.org/1441	WIKI	The GSU iGEM team has been working with the PGAPZ&#945; vector system in order to use the vector to artificially produce the peptide Mambalgin-1, naturally found in the African Black Mamba snake venom. This protein is unique because it has the ability to exhibit sensations comparable to morphine, but is less addictive, more efficient, and easier to obtain on a larger scale, if synthesized in a laboratory setting. By ligating the Mambalgin DNA into the PGAPZ&#945; expression system, we are able to linearize and ultimately transform the gene of interest into eukaryotic yeast, Pichia Pastoris, allowing the protein to be excreted in its most pure form. The nature of the PGAPZ&#945; and Pichia Pastoris successfully provides a smooth transition from prokaryotic to eukaryotic expression of the gene; therefore, we have chosen these vectors to effectively isolate and extract our most desired Mambalgin-1 peptide.
https://teams.igem.org/1442	WIKI	Disrupting the flow of biological information at the level of mRNA is a safer alternative to conventional gene therapy, wherein insertional mutagenesis can occur through integrating vectors. In addition, the ability to regulate the level of expression of a gene using such vectors proves difficult. Therefore, we aim to create a modular, self-replicating RNA system using Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) derived RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). This drives production of siRNA directed against the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) which is elevated in type 2 diabetes and is the target of major drug studies. The replicon contains control modules, exhibiting a negative feedback mechanism provided by: an MS2 domain linked to RdRp, thereby controlling RdRp translation and therefore controlling replication, and an aptazyme switch to regulate expression levels of our siRNA. Validation of our system and the testing of modules will be performed in human (Huh 7.5) and E. coli cells.
https://teams.igem.org/1443	Entrepreneurship	We have engineered a three-channel switch that is controlled with the intensity of blue light. By utilizing the mechanisms of the lambda repressor, we are able to switch between the expressions of three different genes with a short delay. This kind of mechanism provides a nearly real-time control over genes, which could provide advantages in variety of industrial bioprocesses. Inspired by the principles of open source software, we introduce an Open Sequence business model implemented around our switch. We want to encourage future companies to create Open Sequence based solutions and to empower customers to participate in the product development. Open Sequence models transparency as well as lower degree of protection raises trust and continuity and benefits larger community. We want to share our experiences and insights in biotech entrepreneurship and address the difficulties that students and newcomers may face in the early stages of building a synthetic biology startup.
https://teams.igem.org/1444	Health & Medicine	Infectious diseases symptomatically similar to malaria are often misdiagnosed in resource-poor, developing countries. Misdiagnosis of such diseases prevents administration of the appropriate treatments in a timely manner, resulting in economic burdens and human suffering. The 2014 Calgary iGEM team has engaged with international infectious diseases experts and end-users to address this issue. We are developing a novel, nucleic acid-based, rapid point-of-care device capable of diagnosing multiple infectious diseases in parallel. Bacillus subtilis is being engineered to generate a chromophoric reporter in response to genetic markers from disease-causing pathogens. B. subtilis spores in a portable, handheld device will be used to detect pathogen DNA capitalizing on an innate mechanism of homologous recombination to express a reporter through a transcriptionally-regulated genetic circuit. Our platform technology can be adapted to detect a myriad of pathogens by modifying the genetic markers to which the system is targeted.
https://teams.igem.org/1445	Health & Medicine	Over the past few decades, the number of antibiotic resistant bacteria has increased steadily; meanwhile, antibiotic production has fallen exponentially. In order to address the growing threat of antibiotic resistance in bacteria, new antibacterial agents are required. We have engineered a novel phage therapy utilizing the endogenous CRISPR-Cas9 system from Streptococcus pyogenes packaged into non-replicating phage. CRISPR-Cas9 systems target 20-32 nucleotide DNA sequences within the bacterial genome. Successful CRISPR targeting to the genome leads to a Cas9-mediated DNA double strand break and subsequent cell death. By cloning targeted CRISPR sequences into the endogenous CRISPR-Cas9 system and introducing this system into Escherichia coli by transformation or through phage infection, we have demonstrated sequence specific killing of bacteria in a heterogeneous bacterial population. The broad ranging applications of such an adaptable and cost effective antibiotic therapy range from healthcare to agriculture and represent the future of antibacterial research.
https://teams.igem.org/1446	Environment	Chlorinated solvents are indispensable to industry, research and household applications. Their accumulation in water supplies and carcinogenic properties present a major environmental and health hazard. OxiGEM are tackling the issue by developing a bioremediation/detection kit to dispose of the common chlorinated solvent dichloromethane (DCM). Our system design, inspired by the DCM-degradation pathway of M. extorquens DM4, is initiated and refined by the dialogue between modeling simulations and experimental data. Incorporation of novel diffusion-limiting biopolymeric beads to encapsulate engineered bacteria ensures safe and efficient DCM degradation. We are constructing a synthetic fluorescent biosensor through GFP fusion to the dcmA promoter, regulated by the DCM-binding protein, DcmR, and maximising the sensitivity and catalytic efficiency of the system through directed evolution. Our DCM clean-up solution, branded DCMation, will be user-friendly in a wide range of workplaces and extendable to the disposal of many other harmful substrates.
https://teams.igem.org/1447	Health & Medicine	The goal of our project is to use an antibody in combination with fluorescent probes to detect <i>Ara h1</i>, a major allergen protein in peanut. We use a detector which is divided into two components, one chemical and one physical. The chemical component is composed of three potential parts: one antibody complex linked to Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), one epitope complex linked to RFP, and finally <i>Ara h1</i>. These are potential parts in the sense that the system will always contain the first two parts (antibody and epitope complexes), but will only contain the third part, <i>Ara h1</i>, if the inserted food sample has been contaminated with peanut protein. The physical component, the biosensor system, is composed of a box containing sensors necessary to detect fluorescence and any eventual changes in fluorescence. This information is processed by a microprocessor to give a color indication, correlated to the changes in fluorescence.

With increasing mandates calling for sustainable mining initiatives, one of the aims is to reduce the environmental impact of mining by increasing mining efficiency through innovative ways. Our project seeks to improve physical separation processes by targeting chalcopyrite (CuFeS2) and sphalerite (ZnS) minerals in natural ores using unique metal-binding peptides displayed on the S-layer of Caulobacter crescentus. We furthered our work by developing a novel directed evolution apparatus that will provide us new tools in improving ore separation, thereby granting our technology versatility and adaptability for biomining. This biological approach provides an alternative in mineral processing that involves fewer harmful chemicals, greater selectivity and better recovery of metals in complex or lower grade ores.

This dilemma is what we aim to tackle in our project. By engineering E. coli to produce scent compounds that are hard to come across naturally, we aim to make perfume accessible for all in a sustainable manner. This synthetic biology approach can be used to create a database of scents that can be ordered to consumer demand. By using E. coli to generate these compounds, we aim to reduce the cost of these scents and improve yield in a more environmentally sustainable and less destructive manner. In summary, our BioBricks will be aimed at the production of a class of scent compounds called terpenoids, which will provide a proof of concept for future scent production..
https://teams.igem.org/1455	WIKI	Our project aims to use synthetic biology to develop a <i>V. cholerae</i> sensor using a new technique. Instead of trying to detect the cholerae toxin, specific sequences of nucleic acid, or antigens, we propose detecting <i>V. cholerae</i> Autoinducer 1 (CAI-1), the bacterias species-specific quorum sensing molecule. If we rewire <i>V. cholerae</i>s own quorum sensing mechanism used in nature to gauge population levels and regulate pathogenicity in a harmless <i>E. coli</i> chassis, we can build a cheap and easy-to-use biosensor that gives a color output when it senses the pathogen. This prototype can serve as a proof-of-concept for future quorum sensing-based pathogen biosensors.

Up to now, the number one cause of death worldwide is caused by ischemia and related conditions such as heart attack or stroke. It is needed to regard the big picture of the condition in order to solve the problem. In our project, our will is to build two different devices, which work synergistically, to fix these two distinct situations. We decided to use hypoxia inducible systems and reactive oxygen species (ROS) sensitive gene fragments. These two receptors will hopefully regulate the release of clot dissolving factors and antioxidant peptides synthesized by our engineered vessel cells. We hope to bring encouraging results in vitro to pave the way of this promising system into the lifesaving remedy method.
https://teams.igem.org/1457	Foundational Advance	E. coli cells naturally secrete a protein called curli into their extracellular matrix that self-assembles into ordered, linear, amyloid fibers important for the structural integrity of the biofilm. We have designed an information encoding and storage system in the E.coli curli biofilm network. In our system, bacteria are engineered to produce a mixture of curli subunits that can later be read out as information. Our system can be put under the control of any environmentally sensitive promoter, facilitating the practicality of using biosensors in the field. Other potential applications include cryptography and nanoscale patterning. This system represents a novel method by which information can be stored in a scaleable nanomaterial with functional potential. Living materials offer an advantage over classical materials because they are adaptable, versatile, and can self-pattern complex architectures.

Today, about 25% of the adult world population suffers from the Metabolic Syndrome. This syndrome is a cluster of dangerous medical conditions, including: obesity, insulin resistance, high blood triglycerides and more. These medical conditions are interconnected and are a result of complex metabolic pathways, meaning most traditional drugs used to treat them have undesired side effects. We intend to utilize synthetic biology in order to develop novel strategies for the treatment of the Metabolic Syndrome. By addressing the causes of the syndrome rather than its symptoms, and by doing so in several different fronts, we hope to present a safe and better way to improve global health!
https://teams.igem.org/1459	New Application	Recently, interest has been growing in waste recovery of chemical elements due to depletion of some ores, especially lanthanide ones. Our goal therefore involved designing a bacterial system capable of detecting and binding lanthanides. We then proposed a method to extract these ions, hence making the recycling of these valuable metals (e.g. from wastewater) effective. Basing on Salmonella iron-binding system we modified lanthanide binding tags to adjust them to different ionic size. We also used a superfolder GFP to measure the concentration of collected ions. When an ion binds to LBT, a signalling pathway is activated, inducing fluorescence. Our project introduces an eco-friendly retrieval technology for industrially significant elements. We hope that extracted metals will be viable for applications in electronics, including medical devices. To propose possible applications in medicine we prepared a report about some fascinating challenges in that field, thus creating the model of Future Lantan Hospital.
https://teams.igem.org/1460	Environment	Heavy metal pollution in water is one of the most significant public health risks around the world. Pollutants including lead, mercury, and nickel can enter water supplies through improper disposal of waste, industrial manufacturing, and mining. Previous researchers have developed biological methods of heavy metal sequestration utilizing heavy metal transport proteins and metallothioneins, a class of low-molecular weight proteins with high binding affinities for heavy metals. In these genetically engineered systems, the transport proteins will preferentially transport a specific heavy metal into the cell and the metallothionein will aggressively bind--driving flux into the cell and sequestering the toxic metal. Our research aims to modularize previous sequestration systems for nickel and mercury utilizing a yeast metallothionein/glutathione-s-transferase fusion protein as well the transport proteins NixA (nickel transporter) and merT/merP (mercury transporter). We also plan to extend this sequestration system using a putative lead transport protein.
https://teams.igem.org/1461	Information Processing	In synthetic biology, Genetic memory devices have been constructed and applied widely from Biocomputing to biomedical technologies as a crucial component. Such memory devices include a cellular counter; a fundamental device which memorizes the number of induction events. Recent efforts have resulted in a cellular counter that can count up to three events. However, this counter cannot be reset to its initial state. Here, we propose a resettable cellular counter called sigma recounter. This counter utilizes the regulation system of sigma factor and anti-sigma factor as the key of its resetting mechanism. In this system a set of sigma factors are designed to update and maintain a count that responds to each inducted event. By the other stimulus, the system initiates a genetic circuit that can express a suitable set of anti-sigma factors and erases the existing memory, which will enable our device to restart the count from any state.

Concretely, we've built up a pathway to produce n-butanol in yeast. Throughout the pathway, all enzymes are transported into the mitochondria with the employment of leading peptide. We hope to bring the output of n-butanol up to a brand new level by utilizing higher concentration of ATP and the powerful coenzyme regeneration system in mitochondria. Moreover, we have assembled a CO2-fixing device with enzymes PRK, Rubisco and CA which are combined by scaffold protein. In order to take advantages of characteristics of subcellular structure, this device was anchored in outer membrane of mitochondria. Finally, we aim at raising the output of n-butanol by fixing CO2 with Rubisco. Meanwhile, we've built up and tested out leading peptides of other organelles for future research.

We attempted to create a recombinase switch which would, in response to arabinose, switch from encoding a flagellar gene, to two genes that encode gas vesicle formation, namely <i>gvpA</i> and <i>gvpC</i>. This switch could be applied to many areas, e.g. desalination, biofuel production and drug production, by simply changing the stimulus that would cause the switch to flip. Computer modelling showed that swimming was detrimental to floatation. In response we created knockouts of two different flagellar genes, <i>motA</i> and <i>fliC</i>. <i>In vivo Gvp</i> expression is toxic to <i>E. coli</i>. Instead, we focused on an RFP/GFP switch, which proved that our switch construct is viable. In the future, RFP and GFP can be replaced by any two functional genes that are desirable.

https://teams.igem.org/1465	Energy	The supply with electricity is facing three major problems: the storage of electricity, the increasing amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide and the development of alternative energy sources. Therefore we want to implement a proof of concept for the production of the biofuel isobutanol from carbon dioxide. A bacterial microcompartment originated from cyanobacteria, called carboxysome, is used to realize the fixation of carbon dioxide in <i>Escherichia coli</i>. Within this microcompartment the carbon dioxide fixation is enabled under aerobic conditions. The needed energy for this process is provided by electricity. The electrons are transferred with a mediator into the cells and its uptake is empowered by different modifications of <i>E. coli</i>, like over-expression of the fumarate reductase. This concept is realized in a self-constructed bioreactor. Finally the production of isobutanol is established by hetereologous expression of various enzymes from different species.
https://teams.igem.org/1466	WIKI	We are aiming to build a system for organizing E. coli in a predetermined way, a MicrOrganizer. We are trying to create biobricks that gives E. coli surface identity, and at the same time binds one E. coli bacterium physically to another E. coli bacterium. This binding will also transfer a signal to the inside of the bacteria and induce gene expression. We want to do this by using the split enzyme principle of the LacZ gene. This gene codes for &#946;-galactosidase which can be split into two parts: &#946;-galactosidase &#945; and &#946;-galactosidase &#946;. The functional enzyme consisting of one alpha and one beta part hydrolyses lactose into galactose and glucose. This process produces on some occasions allolactose which can be transported back into the bacteria and induces the Lac-operon, and thus gene expression. To express each enzyme part on the bacterial surface we will couple them to autotransporter proteins.
https://teams.igem.org/1467	Food & Nutrition	Food security is a prominent health challenge faced by the increasing global population, which is exacerbated by high loss of crop yields to pests and diseases. Applying synthetic biology approaches, we aim to produce proof of concept, sentinel plants that will diagnose the presence of two pathogens, <i>Xanthomonas oryzae</i> and <i>Xanthomonas campestris</i>. The plant sentinels will produce a chromoprotein output, observable by the human eye, within 48 hours of pathogen infection. The sentinels would allow growers to apply appropriate agrochemical application before the diseases progress to symptomatic pathogenesis in neighbouring crops. This approach will reduce crop losses whilst decreasing the necessity for continual use of agrochemicals. Furthermore, we are constructing a series of BioBricks that will allow Golden Gate assembly to assist cloning of transcriptional units within the iGEM standard. These important developments will aid future iGEM teams to work with plant chassis as well as utilise Golden Gate technology.
https://teams.igem.org/1468	Village	The STOOL project aims at deeply stydying four of the key engineering pillars of Synthetic Biology. STOOL stands for STandardization, STability, Orthogonality and Open Licence/legal issues. The first approach will consist of a vast range of analytical studies to find out how standard, stable, orthogonal and patentable are several selected Biobrick parts. The second approach will include functional metagenomics: several environmental libraries will be set and screened in E. coli in order to select new biological parts -promoters- not because of their strength but because of their particularly standard, stable or orthogonal behavior. Taken together, the results of our project are expected to contribute to answer this key question: Is life fully engineerable?
https://teams.igem.org/1469	Health & Medicine	Cancer is not only one of the most common diagnoses, but also the leading cause of death worldwide. There are only limited therapeutic possibilities and these are mostly associated with adverse effects. A special form of hyaluronic acid has the potential to become an innovative therapeutic drug for the treatment of cancer. Originally discovered in connective tissues of Heterocephalus glaber this high-molecular-mass hyaluronic acid (HMM-HA) is supposed to mediate the cancer resistance in this species. Our aim is to employ a simple soil bacterium as an expression system for the first ever biotechnological production of this HMM-HA. After purification we want to test and further characterise its inhibitory effect on carcinogenesis in selected human cancer cell lines. We are confident that the anti carcinogenic properties and high biocompatibility of our synthesized HMM-HA will herald a new age of fighting cancer.
https://teams.igem.org/1470	New Application	The rapid development of synthetic biology is accompanied by an increased demand for methods that should not only enable the delivery of various genes, but also provide spatial and temporal control over gene expression.<br> We, the iGEM team Freiburg 2014, designed a system which combines the advantages of two biotechnological approaches  the spatio-temporal resolution of optogenetics and the simplicity of gene transfer offered by viruses. In our engineered cell line light induction leads to the expression of a specific receptor serving as the entry point for the viral vector that carries the genes to be inserted.<br> Thus our system allows specifying a subpopulation of cells by illumination at different time points to mark them as targets for viral gene transduction. The unlimited variety of gene cargos and the straightforward application of The AcCELLerator equip future iGEM teams with a fast gene delivery tool for mammalian cells.
https://teams.igem.org/1471	Village	In Mexico and around the world there is an urgent need to implement measures to reduce heavy metal soil pollution. Different treatments have been used including in situ and ex situ, which have proven extremely expensive and impractical for large scale areas. For this project we have designed a modular system, plastic and ready to incorporate to A. thaliana; in order to extract the metals, in particular mercury, from the soil and convert it into a less reactive species. The final challenge is to develop a measurable, specific, effective, safe and low-cost treatment for large areas of contaminated soil.
https://teams.igem.org/1472	WIKI	Obesity has now reached epidemic proportions worldwide, which has serious consequences because obesity is associated with various chronic human diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases. With the aim to protect oneself against obesity and debilitating diseases caused by a high-fat diet, we are using a synthetic biology approach to design an Escherichia coli strain (called Fit Coli) that has an enhanced ability to uptake and convert excess fatty acids from fatty foods into a-linolenic acid (ALA). The strategy is to engineer the fadL and fadD genes along with three desaturase genes to facilitate the uptake of long-chain fatty acids and their biotransformation to ALA by the Fit Coli strain. It is predicted that the ALA converted from excess fatty acids by Fit Coli is converted to docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an omega-3-fatty acid, in the human gut, which is well known to have many positive health benefits.
https://teams.igem.org/1473	Environment	This year, we are trying to develop a CRISPR system combined with phage transduction to solve bacteria's resistance to antibiotics. The type II CRISPR system is a powerful mechanism in gene engineering. This system has been proved to have more efficiency than other mechanisms such as zinc finger or TALEN. However CRISPR can only function within one cell, so we use M13 phage as vector to send our CRISPR into bacteria cells to cure their resistance for M13 is a lysogenic phage. In order to regulate our phage transduction, we use phagemid pBluescript and M13KO7 helper phage. The pBluescript contains our designed CRISPR system, it will produce CRISPR-transferd M13 phage only when a helper phage infect bacterium which have pBluescript. Then the engineered M13 phage will infect other bacteria and induce transduction of CRISPR system. Once we start the CRISPR, it will recognize and knock down the antibiotic resistance gene.

https://teams.igem.org/1475	WIKI	Edible coli is a nutrition source of high quality emerging from a yet untapped food resource: <i>Escherichia coli</i> (<i>E.coli</i>). Through genetical modification, an odorless <i>E. coli</i> strain will be able to overproduce a self-designed wonder protein, containing the exact ratio of essential amino acids needed in the daily diet. Furthermore, the Edible coli will be able to produce essential fatty acids, &#937;3 and &#937;6. Neither of these products can be synthesized by the human body. This amazing nutrition-combo will be obtained from the degradation of otherwise non-degradable material for humans, such as cellulose. Edible coli is thus a bacteria containing some of the optimal quantity of nutrition a person needs, and will at the same time be tasty  with a touch of lemon.
https://teams.igem.org/1476	WIKI	Photovoltaics are one of the main sources of renewable energy and are likely to become more widely used in the future, but their production is expensive and involves toxic materials. Biological photovoltaics (BPVs) have the potential to provide a cheaper and more sustainable alternative, especially where energy demand is lower. They could power the social, welfare and economic growth for the 1.2 billion people without access to electricity. BPVs take advantage of photosynthetic organisms by harnessing the electrons they produce from water and sunlight. We aim to increase their output by redirecting electron flow in the cyanobacteria Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. To achieve this we have targeted areas in the photosynthetic electron transport chain to increase electrons, and pilus production to improve transfer to the anode.
https://teams.igem.org/1477	North America	An assay for coliphage detection has been developed which employs the release of the host indicator cell beta-galactosidase enzyme activity by lytic coliphage and the conversion of a colorimetric substrate, shortening the APHA time to 3 hrs. We're engineering cell lines containing the gene fragments of LacZalpha and will use an E.coli cell line with the M15 mutation expressing the omega fragment of Beta-galactosidase. We're introducing a cassette of coliphage cell lysis genes under the control of a coliphage promoter to accelerate the enzyme fragment release, further reducing test time. Alternative to the enzymatic read-out we are exploring a microfluidic system to detect the lysis of the cells. Our goal is to design a fast-acting hand-held coliphage biosensor device that can be used by someone without any special technical expertise. Our device is useful in rapidly reporting the contamination of recreational waters or assuring drinkable water in developing nations.
https://teams.igem.org/1478	Environment	Plant against: Our title reveals the main organism of our project: plants. We designed a protein for plants, Top4-Metal Binding Protein (T4-MBP), composed of four different domains for the binding of heavy metals. We have chosen the domains from different organisms considering heavy metals with a global relevance: copper, arsenic, zinc and cadmium. Our goal is to produce the T4-MBP in plants, where it will be transported out of the plant cells to attach itself to the cellulose. The binding of the heavy metals via plants is supposed to work in water or on ground to clean up many different areas containing heavy metals. Furthermore we have other fields of application, like the purification of drinking water. With our project we want to provide the world an easy way to remove heavy metals where chemical solutions are lacking.
https://teams.igem.org/1479	Software	Confusing biobrick database and different ways of interpreting the bio-system remain to be two main problems in synthetic biology. To help wet-lab users get neat information and evaluation of specific biobricks quickly and to display their bio-system easily, we create "Easy BBK". Users can input keywords of the biobrick they are interested in and select special requirements of certain properties that are listed in the software, biobricks related will be listed, sorted by a score given to each biobrick, which takes into consideration the current status, user comments and reviews, times of citation in a publication and etc. Additionally, Users could draw their bio-system easily with the standardized biobrick icons, and they can also look into the detailed information about the biobricks in the bio-system. Finally, before self-created biobricks are uploaded to the official database, users could first assess their biobricks in our software according to our assessment model.
https://teams.igem.org/1480	Information Processing	The interest on GMOs and their potential exploitability has rapidly grown, but public concerns about their controllability once introduced into the environment have limited their usage. In order to offer a security system, we have designed a stratagem and a series of tools to posses the ability to hack the genetic composition of GMOs, either to "reset" the genetic programmation back to wild-type or to modify it for a different one if an "update" is required. To achieve this, we integrated a DNA delivery system that works in situ and a sequence-specific DNA digestion system that works in vivo. The main advantage our work provides against suicide switches, a different type of security system for GMOs, is that our technology does not trigger a "shut down" to the target organism. As a reliable eco-friendly tool, our system is not able to hack native species, only those developed in the laboratory.
https://teams.igem.org/1481	Information Processing	We have designed a synthetic digital device inspired by electronic circuits called multiplexers. Its 3-bit memory allows saving and processing binary inputs in E. coli. Induced expression of serine recombinases, capable of specific DNA editing, enables construction of biological analogues of transistors - transcriptors - and their use as elementary memory units called SR-latches. The fourth, strobe signal resets the system to its original state. We have shown that the system could efficiently store data about previous contact with inducing sugars across hundreds of generations. This memory unit offers high sensitivity in inducer detection and signal amplification, allowing cheap induction or further development and use as a trace contaminants sensor. Eight possible output combinations, reported as RGB fluorescent proteins, may also turn out to be useful for complex coexpression research.
https://teams.igem.org/1482	Software	Overlap-based cloning techniques like Gibson Assembly and Circular Polimerase Extension Cloning (CPEC) have been recently becoming more and more popular. While available software allows rapid overlap design for constructs of conventional size, details of its functioning are not always fully transparent. MUFASA aims not only at facilitating the scarless cloning from the oligonucleotide design to putting the tubes into the thermocycler, but also at designing the fragments themselves in parallel with the overlaps for synthesis of big constructs de novo. Use of multiple overlaps pose a risk of non-specific hybridization and overlap shadowing. Such shadowy places may be eliminated by thermodynamic sequence optimization of both CPEC primers and fragments of the desired construct.
https://teams.igem.org/1483	WIKI	Blood types within the ABO-system differ in their glycosylation. The oligosaccharide characterizing type O is a precursor for those characterizing types A and B. Thus, shortages of type O blood units, which can be received by people with any common ABO genotype, might be overcome by specific deglycosylation of blood units of type A, B or AB. For this task we will utilize blood antigen-specific glycosidases in combination with different immobilisation tags. Ultimately we aim to create a matrix coated with our enzymes, able to convert blood for transfusion. Of the three enzymes we utilize, two will leave the blood compatible with all common ABO-types, while one will make the blood compatible even with the rare Bombay-blood type (Oh). Additionally we will provide the parts-registry with new protein-tags in the RFC25 standard for fusion proteins, allowing protein-protein coupling as well as immobilization on specifically prepared matrices.

https://teams.igem.org/1485	Foundational Advance	We aim to establish one visual operation system of continuous target gene replacement to transform target gene into the high expression site through homologous recombination in the Aspergillus Niger genome. In this construct, amilCP gene was driven by GlaA5 promoter, and followed by GlaA3 terminator; the HPH and cjBlue fusion gene was driven by pgpdA promoter, and followed by GlaA3 terminator. GlaA5 and GlaA3 can be used as homologous arm sequences that can mediate specific recombination. After homologous recombine between homologous arm sequences, we will get the transgenic Aspergillus Niger cells only express amilCP gene which can be easily detected by blue color. These transgenic Aspergillus Niger cells with blue color can be used as original strain for target gene transformation. Those colonies without blue color will be the real transformants in which amilCP gene is replaced with the target gene.
https://teams.igem.org/1486	New Application	The BioPad project aims to study how biological signals can be detected and processed in a fast and precise way. To illustrate this vision of biology, our team created the worlds first biological TouchPad. On top of serving as a living TouchPad, the BioPad will serve as a fast antibiotic screening device, an apparatus allowing the study of gene activation, and a perfect way to introduce synthetic biology and bio-hardware to the general public via a graspable project. Our BioPad is made of three components: touch responsive organisms, a custom microfluidic chip, and a mini-computer serving as a signal detector. Once touched, the BioPad responds quickly by emitting light or fluorescence. The biological engineering behind our project combines protein complementation techniques to dimerization in E. Coli and S. cerevisiae stress pathways. Split reporter proteins from fluorescent proteins, and luciferases were fused to the dimerizing proteins, allowing signal emission upon stress.
https://teams.igem.org/1487	WIKI	Treating infectious diseases of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract with antibiotics disrupts a patient's gut microbiota and can increase the prevalence of antibiotic resistant strains. The increasing population of multi-drug resistant bacterial strains, both within and outside of health centers, is a growing health concern that is becoming progressively difficult to treat. <p>We envision a new paradigm for treating infections of the human gastrointestinal tract through exploitation of engineered probiotics that produce anti-microbials with high specificity for pathogens at the genome level. Toward this end, we will utilize the CRISPR/Cas9 system with gRNA engineered to recognize genes from infectious bacteria. Our CRISPR/Cas9 system will be delivered from the engineered E. coli to infectious bacteria using bacterial specific phages, minimizing any side-effects to native microbiota and human-host cells. As a proof-of-principle for our engineered probiotic, we start by targeting the pathogenic bacterium Vibrio cholera.
https://teams.igem.org/1488	New Application	Traditionally pathogens have been annihilated using pharmaceuticals, but today nanotechnology offers a new possibility with the use of nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS). We present a novel device that could make these processes possible: the BioNEMS Drill. This is a magnetic portion of chromatin. To construct the device we synthesized hydrophilic magnetite. We used it due to its bio-compatibility for medical applications and later functionalized them with amino groups, which can establish a peptide bond between nanoparticles and a protein. We used the HU histone-like protein, capable of coiling DNA around the nanoparticles. To get enough protein, we modified E. Coli to overexpress it. Since the core of the device is magnetic it can be controlled by applying an external magnetic field. Furthermore, the versatility of the DNA to be coated with various materials and its functionalization can selectively remove certain chemicals inside the human body such as cholesterol or toxic agents.
https://teams.igem.org/1489	Environment	The population of Crasseoterra virginica, the Eastern oyster, is a fraction of what it once was. A major reason for this decline is the spread of Perkinsus marinus, a protist that infests oyster cells, causing tissue damage and eventual oyster death. P. marinus infection requires recognition of a four-domain galectin protein, CvGal1, produced by oyster hemocytes to capture bacteria by binding surface sugars. P. marinus targets CvGal1 using unknown carbohydrate ligands on the protest surface. As a first step in generating a bacterial biosensor for P. marinus, a recombinant OmpA-CvGal1 protein was engineered to anchor on the E. coli outer cell membrane. OmpA fusions with mammalian two-domain galectins were similarly engineered to investigate the effect of galectin size on the efficiency of membrane display and pathogen recognition. The receptor was designed to couple to a defensive response, such as the production of anchored beta-galactosidase to cleave P. marinus recognition ligands.
https://teams.igem.org/1490	Community Labs	<i>Streptococcus mutans</i> is one of the primary early agents in the formation of dental caries. It forms biofilms that promote tooth demineralization. <i>Streptococcus salivarius</i> is a competitor to <i>S. mutans</i>, but not a terribly good one. In this project, we introduce a dextranase which breaks up biofilms, and a mutanase which attacks <i>S. mutans</i>, into a plasmid with the appropriate promoters and secretion signals to allow the proteins to be expressed and secreted from our transformed <i>S. salivarius</i>. This organism in it's untransformed state is generally recognized as safe and we have isolated it from an over-the-counter probiotic gum. It forms an attractive chassis for the development of engineered oral probiotics.
https://teams.igem.org/1491	Village	Detection of hormones in the environment has raised concerns recently because of their potential to affect both humans and wildlife. Estrogens from natural, synthetic, plant, and fungal sources show endocrine disrupting properties and even at low concentrations have harmful effects due to receptor activation. A sensor was constructed using the ligand binding domain of the human estrogen receptor. Estrogenic activity occurs in water sources including waste, drinking, and freshwater. In freshwater, estrogens are harmful to the ecosystems, feminizing fish and disrupting populations of organisms. Additionally, estrogenic substances can be present in what we drink. However, since the presence of hormones in water is a relatively new area of study there have been no previous restrictions or regulations regarding removal of estrogenic compounds. The sensor and fish ecosystems were modeled and middle school outreach kits for Creature Feature and DNA extraction and hybridization were created to demonstrate concepts of synthetic biology.
https://teams.igem.org/1492	New Application	A fundamental problem in utilizing genetically modified bacteria is their limited ability to survive under non-natural conditions, such as the harsh conditions in industrial reactors and the immune system in the human body. We report a <i>Plug-and-Play</i> system allowing the introduction of chemical anchors on cell membranes, subsequently used to attach a functional coating. The anchors consist of azidophenylalanine, which couples covalently with molecules containing the strained alkyne DBCO in a so-called "click" reaction. We obtained proof of concept that our developed Clickable Outer Membrane Proteins (COMP) enable this fast and effective click reaction. We apply it to create a safe <i>clicked-on</i> coating allowing <i>E.coli</i> to be used in the human body for healthcare purposes. Furthermore, microfluidic devices have been designed, ensuring increased control over the click reaction and single cell coating. We believe our <i>Plug-and-Play</i> system is a versatile tool providing numerous possibilities for engineering bacteria on outer membranes.

Our project aims to use an engineered strain of the native soil bacterium <i>Pseudomonas putida</i> to protect banana plants against <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i> infection.</p> <p>Upon sensing of fusaric acid excreted by <i>F. oxysporum</i>, fungal growth inhibitors will be produced by <i>P. putida</i> to prevent infection of the banana plants. To minimize the environmental impact of the fungal inhibitors to the soil microbiome, the bacteria will contain a kill switch that will cause it to terminate once the threat of <i>F. oxysporum</i> to the bananas has been alleviated. Furthermore, a double dependent plasmid system will be used to prevent the spread of artificial genetic material to surrounding soil bacteria.</p> <p>In summary, we hope to develop a showcase for the use of synthetic biology in agriculture in a safe and sustainable way.</p>

https://teams.igem.org/1495	Village	Approximately 3 billion gallons per year of frying oil are used in the United States. The purpose of this project is to create a value added product from used frying oil as the feedstock. <i>Escherichia coli</i> is being engineered to breakdown lipids to acetyl-CoA and produce a high value terpenoid based product through the mevalonate pathway. A biosensor will be incorporated to detect the presence of lipids via the interaction of acyl-CoA with FadR which results in the de-repression of Green Fluorescent Protein. For added security, a kill switch is being developed to destroy the cell if released into the environment. The protein KillerRed is repressed in the presence of tryptophan. In the absence of tryptophan and in the presence of light, KillerRed will kill the cell through the production of reactive oxygen species. The progress on the various parts of the project will be presented.
https://teams.igem.org/1496	Measurement	Synthetic biology, or the use of engineering principles to design biological systems, is a relatively new science. A common application of synthetic biology is biosensing, which utilizes cell function to sense and respond to stimuli in a predictable way. As synthetic biology grows, so does the need to develop standards for genetic constructs, such as biosensors. This project introduces a plug-and-play method for biosensing circuits and provides a protocol for characterizing sensors. A two-plasmid system, with an interchangeable sensor and reporter, is employed in our standard. The sensor is created by generating a chimera between a sensing gene and a histidine kinase, which activates regulatory proteins and controls the activity of a reporter. Our reporter will respond by fluorescing in the presence of a target due to sensor activity. A biosensor circuit platform bridges the gap in todays protocols, modeling the work that should be done in synthetic biology.
https://teams.igem.org/1497	Energy	This year the team aims to achieve victory in the championship of synthetic biology by investigating a new approach to produce a plant pigment called Anthocyanin in Escherichia coli (E. coli). This class of pigment not only stains blossoms in blue, violet or red but also is enclosed in fruits and is valued for its antioxidant effect as well as the ability to lower the risks for cancer. In the teams technological approach, the anthocyanin dye can be utilised to build so-called Grätzel cells. These electrochemical dye-sensitized solar cells use the produced dye instead of a semiconductor material for the absorption of light. The objective is to investigate an innovative approach for a sustainable energy source; wherever and whenever needed. In the course of the project phase, the team will construct a Grätzel cell testing their dye that was produced in E. coli.

https://teams.igem.org/1499	North America	There are growing applications for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in both space exploration and terrestrial activities, such as remote environmental monitoring and payload delivery. However, these devices are complex, costly, and made of non-eco-friendly materials, preventing their widespread use in scientific and humanitarian missions. We are pioneering the development of the first biologically-produced UAV, which will present numerous advantages over the current manufacturing paradigm. First, a foundational architecture built by cells allows for construction in almost any location and responsible disposal through biodegradation. To this end, we are synthesizing a novel cellulose acetate bioplastic, characterizing natural waterproofing proteins, and programming timed biodegradation. Second, we are leveraging synthetic biology to move costly analytic functions, which require bulky electrical components, into a cell layer with biosensing capabilities. In thinking about synthetic biology in the environment, we developed the Amberless Toolkit as a standard for preventing expression of synthetic constructs in undesired organisms.
https://teams.igem.org/1500	WIKI	Directed evolution engineers organisms to produce proteins of novel function and industrially relevant biomolecules. Traditionally, in vivo directed evolution relies on physical or chemical mutagens that cause accumulation of toxic and nonspecific deleterious mutations. A novel system, termed feedback-regulated evolution of phenotype (FREP), overcomes these problems by incorporating a variable mutation rate system to mimic natural evolution. This is achieved through the dynamic control of a mutator element negatively regulated by the desired end product. The 2014 UChicago iGEM team implemented and optimized FREP in E. coli, using the tyrosine pathway as a proof of concept. We combined multiple mutators with different biases for a deeper exploration of the search space, increasing the initial mutation rate and speeding the accumulation of beneficial mutations. Eliminating mutational bias should increase sequence space search efficiency, significantly improving the process of directed evolution for industrial production of any biomolecule.

Since one species relies on the other for induction of their own essential gene, mutualism is obligatory. Another key component of our efforts addresses the need for effective interactive models to facilitate teaching and understanding of synthetic biology concepts.

https://teams.igem.org/1502	WIKI	The Arizona State iGEM team aims to produce biodiesel in a new and efficient way using Escherichia coli. Using a wax esterase, fatty acids and ethanol, both naturally produced by E. coli, can be combined to form biodiesel. However, E. coli uses the same intermediate products to produce both fatty acids and ethanol, which reduces the efficiency of this process. This problem can be avoided by engineering two different strains of E. coli to work in tandem. One strain will be engineered to produce free fatty acids (FFA) through expression of enzymes including as TesA and acc. The other strain will be engineered to produce ethanol through expression of enzymes including pdc and adhB. These two products will be combined in one of the two cells using a waxy esterase, producing the final biodiesel product. Cooperative production will hopefully produce more ethanol than current single strain methods using E. coli.
https://teams.igem.org/1503	Foundational Advance	In order to determine the replicative age of a yeast cell, researchers usually rely on direct micromanipulation of daughter cells and bud-scar counting. Given the long generation time of a cell (approx. 90 min), measuring its replicative lifespan is a laborious and time-consuming procedure. The goal of this project is to address this problem with a synthetic biology approach. We design and implement in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> a synthetic gene circuit that colors mother cells depending on their replicative age. We use a combination of endogenous elements and Crispr/Cas-based transcription factors to induce expression of different fluorescent proteins depending on the number of budding events that the mother cells have already experienced. We foresee that the successful outcome of this project will not only facilitate yeast age determination but will also pave the way to using cell sorters in order to fully automatize the procedure.
https://teams.igem.org/1504	Village	Cancerous cells are known to give off volatile compounds (alkanes) that can be detected by trained dogs. Our goal is to engineer a strain of Yarrowia lipolytica, which is capable of detecting alkanes, to turn color in the presence of these volatile compounds. We hope that we can use this yeast to detect melanoma cheaply and non-invasively (perhaps in a cancer detecting band-aid). To achieve our goal, we will build a reporter construct that uses an alkane sensitive promoter to drive the expression of a blue chromoprotein from the coral Acropora millepora which should cause the yeast to turn blue in the presence of alkanes. Our parts include an alkane response element (3xARE1), a leu minimal promoter, our reporter gene (blue chromoprotein), and a terminator (XPR2). Once the reporter construct is assembled, we will clone it into a Yarrowia lipolytica shuttle vector and integrate it into the yeast genome.

There is significant demand for the effective bioremediation of cadmium in developing countries and in industrial regions. Current methods are expensive and often produce undesired byproducts. We engineered a strain of magnetotactic bacteria known as Magnetospirillum magneticum AMB-1 for biosorption of cadmium. AMB-1 is a strain of magnetotactic bacteria that aligns to magnetic fields with magnetite-accumulating organelles. This strain has been identified as a suitable chassis as it can be isolated with magnetic forces. A metal transporter gene native to other magnetotactic strains (mntH) and a S-adenosyl-methionine-dependent methyltransferase (smtA) derived from E. coli were incorporated into a genetic circuit designed to maximize biosorption and cadmium tolerance. AMB-1 carrying this design on a shuttle vector plasmid were tested for bioremediation efficiency.
https://teams.igem.org/1506	Foundational Advance	Engineering metabolic pathways requires answering several questions and often performing many experiments. We sought to answer such "combinatorial questions" using new biophysical models and experimental approaches. First, we employed the CRISPR/Cas9 system to identify the missing enzymes of a metabolic pathway that functions in one organism, but not in another. We demonstrate our approach on a 5-enzyme catabolic pathway that functions in P. putida, but not in E. coli. Once a multi-enzyme pathway functions in a preferred host, the DNA sequence of the system must then be optimized to achieve a desired metabolic activity. We took a forward engineering approach to systematically investigate the differences in translation rate capacity when using either "frequent", "fast", "rare", or "slow" synonymous codons during codon optimization of protein coding sequences. Our research will enable metabolic engineers to overcome two of the most commonly encountered combinatorial questions during metabolic pathway engineering.

Our circuit utilizes catabolite repression mechanism of E coli to measure the concentration of glucose in honey. We construct plasmid Bba_J04450 by inserting either Adenylate cyclase or IIA Glc which may affect the sensitivity of catabolite repression. Creation of novel circuit which consists of constitutive promoter followed by either Adenylate Cyclase or IIAGlc genes, which placed downward lac-mRFP circuit, may affect the sensitivity of catabolite repression. We expect an engineered E coli shows red color expression in different range of glucose concentration. By changing mRFP gene with amilCP, a blue fluorescent protein, we may obtain E. coli expressing either red or blue color when different honey added to the medium due to different glucose concentration.

To be more specific, water sources can be contaminated by heavy metals leaching from industrial waste; acid rain can exacerbate this process by releasing heavy metals trapped in soils. Considering the properties of heavy metals, unable to decay and thus a different kind of challenge for medication, we have constructed a heavy metal detection and recycle system. Briefly, our system is based on a special strain of E.coli containing smt-locus, CDS7 and an unfamiliar flocculation gene. The system can detect the existence of metal zinc and cadmium through visualized pigment gene driven by the smt-locus, recycle these heavy metal ions by forming nanocrystals resulted from CDS7 and flocculate the nanocrystals. Eventually, we can realize our double-win goal, safeguarding our environment by removing heavy metal ions and yielding a great amount of nanocrystals.

To achieve this, we design a bio-system-recombinant luminous Escherichia coli to which diverse bio-sensors are transformed. Then we ascertain the quality of water by analysis the light intensity which correlated to the expression of lux gene reflecting comprehensive toxicity and multi-FP genes indicating specific toxicities.

Absence of symptoms in early stages leads to a late diagnosis when patients need dialysis or even transplants. Currently, CKD is diagnosed by measuring creatinine levels in blood, which in turn are detectable only at late stages of renal dysfunction as well as are sensitive to factors such as diet, gender, ethnicity, age, muscle mass. We report the development of a biosensor that can diagnosis CKD in its early stages, identifying a biomarker named Cystatin C. Using a cell surface biosensor as detector and quorum-sensing system as transducer and response mechanism, we developed a genetic circuit that establishes a threshold, differentiating concentration ranges of Cystatin C.

Then a novel MFC system was designed. For anode strain, weve cloned a PNP sensor sequence and a riboflavin into Escherichia coli. The recombinants is able to detect PNP and produce riboflavin to boost electrical generation when co-cultured with Shewanella oneidensis. In the cathode, gene codes chromate (VI) reductase Yief was cloned into E.coli. The stability of MFCs has been improved and the electricity generated was correlated with the substrates.

Developing regions that rely heavily on agriculture, but have less regulations related to pesticide use tend to suffer the most from pesticide pollution. Organophosphates (OP) represent a large class of toxic pesticides used heavily in these areas. We have designed novel devices to detect these toxic pollutants in waterways called PUPS, or Paper Utilizing Pesticide Sensors. These devices are paper-based with 3D printed shells, making them very cost effective for use in poor areas worldwide. The PUPS will utilize a fusion protein that will be produced in E. coli to degrade organophosphates into 4-nitrophenol (4NP), which OPs degrade into naturally over time. The 4NP will then be reduced in order to electrochemically measure the 4NP concentration at cheap, graphite electrodes. These reactions all occur within cellulose paper, which drives the microfluidic movement of the samples.

The promoter of destination node in SPP is followed by a green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a reporter.

Mosaicoli aims at investigating emergence of complex patterns from a simple rule by engineering a cellular automaton into E. coli. This automaton comprises a grid of colonies on a 3D-printed millifuidic chip. Each colony is either in an ON or OFF state and updates its state by integrating signals from its neighbors according to a genetically pre-programmed logic rule. Complex patterns, like Sierpinski triangles, are visualized by fluorescence after several steps of row-wise propagation. The implementation of quorum sensing based sequential logic computation is challenged by leakiness and crosstalk present in biological systems. Mosaicoli overcomes these issues by exploiting multichannel orthogonal communication, riboregulators and integrase-based XOR logic gates.

However, these kill-switches suffer from a fundamental flaw since they impose selective pressure on organisms to evolve inactivation of the genetic safeguard. The activation of a kill-switch removes all individuals containing intact kill-switches from the population, leaving behind only individuals with defective kill-switches to found a new population. This project proposes an inducible plasmid-loss system to remove genetically engineered traits from a population without imposing selective pressure against the safeguard itself. The inducible plasmid-loss system is implemented by creating a plasmid containing CRISPR/Cas9, an RNA-guided nuclease system which targets and cleaves itself. A population containing this plasmid is expected to revert to wild-type upon activation. In addition to encouraging the application of evolutionary approaches to the field of synthetic biology, this project also contributes to making synthetic organisms safe for routine use outside the lab.
https://teams.igem.org/1560	Energy	Today our energy needs are met by burning ancient fuels, accumulated from historic, decayed organic carbon, and stored deep in the earth. Every atom of this ancient carbon was once present as a simpler molecule, synthesized to more complex carbon molecules by plants using solar power and through our burning, returned to the atmosphere in a multi-thousand year cycle. Today, we are burning more of this slow-solar petroleum than is being made and we accumulate CO2 as a greenhouse gas. We intend to directly address global CO2 accumulation through a fast-solar strategy that relies on rapid conversion of cellulose from plants to an energy-rich liquid fuel. For 2014, Team UCSC will focus on production of butanol fermented by a salt-loving microbe.
https://teams.igem.org/1561	Health & Medicine	Obesity is a serious problem all over the world, it increases the likelihood of various diseases, particularly heart disease, type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, certain types of cancer, and osteoarthritis. The weight loss pill on the market tody have a big side effect on our health. More over&#65292;Fatty acid biosynthesis is essential for cell growth. The Fatty acid Synthase II pathway has attracted considerable attention because it presents multiple potential target for antibiotic development, especially after us elucidating the enzyme structure of each step of this pathway. There are a lot of unknown small molecular that have the potential to inhibit the fatty acid synthesis. For example, there is still a lot of unexplored area of the traditional Chinese medicine. What we need to do is to construct a bio-sensor in order to screen the drug we want in such a big pool.
https://teams.igem.org/1562	Software	Choosing apt and reliable protocols for new experiments is a problem that wet labs routinely face due to the difficulty in anticipating which protocols will produce the best results. Experimental practices may differ immensely across laboratories and precise details of these practices may be lost or forgotten as skilled faculty or students leave the lab to pursue other endeavors. Furthermore, there are few well-defined protocols that are generally agreed upon by the scientific community, in part due to the lack of a system that can supply a measure of a protocols acceptance. In order to address these problems, we set out to build a database that integrates a crowdsourced ratings and comments system to serve as a protocol curator that enables wet lab investigators to compare various protocol efficacies, quantify a protocols acceptance within the scientific community, and provide an avenue through which experiential knowledge can be communicated.

https://teams.igem.org/1564	Energy	The UC-Santa Cruz-BioE team is working to design a self-sustaining microbial fuel cell (MFC) that can run on waste water. Microbial fuel cells use bacteria to metabolize organic compounds from waste water and generate electricity under anaerobic conditions through electron transfer to an anode. For our project we plan on engineering <i>Shewanella oneidensis</i> as our electrogenic host. Our first goal is to increase the coulombic efficiency that is lost by <i>Shewanellas</i> preference to turn acetyl-CoA into acetate, as opposed to metabolizing it through the citric acid cycle<a href="http://2014.igem.org/Team:UC-Santa_Cruz-BioE/Project">[2]</a>. Our second goal is to increase the efficiency of the MFC by altering growth patterns of the bacteria. Current density has been shown to be dependent on biofilm formation by the electrogenic bacteria within the MFC<a href="http://2014.igem.org/Team:UC-Santa_Cruz-BioE/Project">[8]</a>. Therefore we plan to increase current density by increasing biofilm growth.
https://teams.igem.org/1565	Health & Medicine	The LIKA- CESAR BRAZIL proposes the development of a biosensor for the detection of breast cancer with the help of robotics. The idea is to build a robotic system linked to genetic engineering capable of processing and prepare small samples of blood in an automated manner. For this our team, will generate useful BioBriks records and parts for possible future insertions in the plates. This system will be coupled to biosensors capable of detecting breast cancer in its earliest stage, where the chances of the patient having an accurate diagnosis and treatment guidance are very high. The automation of the entire process, together with the creation of a specific biosensor for breast cancer, will result in a future decrease in deaths from the disease, due to a more rapid and effective treatment.
https://teams.igem.org/1566	North America	We propose an iterative concept mapping framework to assess ethical, legal, social, and environmental outcomes associated with releasing genetically engineered plants beyond the laboratory. We then apply this framework to The Glowing Plant, the worlds first crowd-funded genetically engineered organism. Rather than prescribing a single responsible course of action, we enable individual users to decide how much weight to attribute to principles such as the conservation of biodiversity, the preservation of human health and safety, the advancement of entrepreneurship and innovation, and the promotion of social equity. We also invite users to contribute additional principles, providing an iterative mechanism to help guide future decisions. By enabling users to explore the potential implications of their choices, and to compare their own preferences to others, our model demonstrates how policy decisions depend on value judgments and encourages reflexive thinking about the social, cultural and ethical negotiations involved in technological oversight.

https://teams.igem.org/1582	New Application	In ancient Roman myth, Janus is the god of beginnings and transitions, who is depicted as having two faces. Our project is focused on another Janus - hydrophobin the protein, who looks to the hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity. Because of this, a sea of new applications are created. Firstly, we re-designed the structures of two classes of hydrophobins, making expression in E.coli possible. Secondly, we use its double-sticky-tape-like ability to make two applications. We take this advantage to fix antibodies on a high-flux tumor detection chip. Meanwhile, they are used to catch cutinases for plastic degradation. We even make them into a fusion to test if the enhancement could be better. Thirdly, we use its amphipathicity to achieve protein separation, where they act as a special purification tag, and the system could be as simple as polymer, detergent and water. With help of this, we could even achieve recovery of cutinases.
https://teams.igem.org/1583	Hardware	Various microorganisms can aggregate and attach to surfaces, thereby forming biofilms. Certain biofilms pose problems in fields such as healthcare and industrial processes. Currently, several methods are used for testing biofilm formation and removal. However, these processes can be improved by adding reproducibility and standardization. Therefore, our goal is to print biofilms in a reproducible and automated way. We achieved this by engineering <i>E. coli</i> cells that link to each other through nanowires upon induction and we printed these cells by means of our do-it-yourself K´NEX printer. Next to biofilm-removal testing, this technique can be used for industrial production processes. For example, as structured printing of microorganisms that catalyze different production steps or enzyme immobilization on the nanowires. To summarize, we aim to develop a new standard for biofilm production, develop our own printer and analyse the market potential of our system.
https://teams.igem.org/1584	Village	Antibiotic-resistant bacteria are a serious problem in the medical community. Detecting antibiotic resistance quickly is crucial to determine the correct treatment for different patients and for setting up quarantines to prevent spreading. We hypothesized that is possible to use quorum sensing (QS) to devise a rapid way for cells to report the existence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Here, we developed a reporter cell that expresses GFP in the presence of the QS signaling molecule acyl homoserine lactone (AHL). Our test cells (which act as a simulation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria) express lactonase, which breaks down AHL. In our experimental system, test cells should signify their presence by breaking down AHL and preventing GFP expression in reporter cells. Therefore, our project serves as a proof of principle and we hope that our work will serve as a basis for developing similar, more sophisticated quorum sensing-based detection systems in the future.
https://teams.igem.org/1585	WIKI	Nowadays, mankind uses 94 million barrels of oil per day. But as agreed on by various nations, we have to become independent from fossil resources during the next decades. As a consequence, not only fuels, but many other products including drugs, fine chemicals and plastic will have to be produced from renewable carbon sources. In parallel, we observe arable land per capita shrinking and more frequent droughts. But even by increasing agricultural productivity, plants will not be able to meet our massive demands. Therefore, we are developing an alternative route to sustainably produce complex carbon which significantly reduces the space and water needs. By using new synthetic pathways, we are upcycling a simple, renewable chemical into a universal carbon source.
https://teams.igem.org/1586	WIKI	Toehold switches are a novel type of RNA riboregulator that binds a specific trigger RNA sequence. Binding causes conformational changes, revealing an RBS and allowing the expression of a reporter. We aim to design a toehold collection with varying reporters including chromoproteins, fluorescent proteins and bioluminescent luciferase. Our project therefore set out to create a diagnostic test to detect a given RNA sequence in a safe, low-tech and cost-effective manner. The trigger-recognition region of the toehold can be altered to bind different specific RNA targets, changing the application. Our project is tailored towards detection of RNA from Mycobacterium Bovis. A problem prevalent in the southwest UK, it is the cause of bovine TB with current testing unable to distinguish between Mycobacterium strains. Expression of our toeholds will utilise S30 cell-free kits and reporter data will be collected using FACS/TECAN. This data will be used for simulation and model fitting.
https://teams.igem.org/1587	Environment	The parasitic mite <i>Varroa destructor</i>, through the detrimental effects it exerts, is one of the main causes explaining the dramatic decline of bee colonies worldwide. Our project aims at limiting its proliferation in hives, thus we designed a trap adaptable to the hive entrance. In this device, our <i>Escherichia coli</i> strain named ApiColi will be used as bait. During the day ApiColi will express butyrate as an attracting molecule to lure <i>Varroa destructor</i> in the trap. By night butyrate expression will be replaced by formate production, a deadly molecule for the mite. This circadian rhythm is based on a chimeric red light receptor, which enables our trap to be in line with the honeybees life cycle and optimizes the lifespan of the device. Completion of this project will provide a solution to tackle the <i>Varroa destructor</i> in a way that is both respectful of the environment and the bees.
https://teams.igem.org/1588	Health & Medicine	Dengue fever is caused by the defensive reaction of the body to the invasion of a virus transmmited by mosquito bite. Is a big problem in developing countries and for over 70 years several attempts to create an effective vaccines have failed; the way to prevent disease is to control vectors: Aedes aegypti. There are at least 4 different virus serotypes which prevalence shifts every year, patients who suffered one particular serotype become immune for life, but getting another serotype, reaction is so severe that dengue becomes hemorrhagic and lethal most of the times. We designed synthetic proteins aimed to produce immunological response against dengue. Using databases and for proteins, epitopes and 3D structures programs we found epitopes for L and T white cells. Then selected a protein and inserted on its chain these epitopes from all serotypes, and 4 proteins containing just one serotype.

Our experiment consists in the construction of a BioBrick which includes coding sequences for PBAN pheromone, the Tu-Delf protein (which acts as bio-glue) and AaHit toxin (a deadly one for insects from a scorpion) . The particularity of this experiment is that a single construct can attract, adhere to the insect protein which allow us to make a single application and also remove the insect by the action of the toxin.
https://teams.igem.org/1590	New Application	Forensic science is key partner in the modern world of law and civil liberties. The field now requires new trustworthy, quantitative technologies that complement DNA-based evidence in court. Our project will tackle this urgent need by employing synthetic biology approaches to build The Synthetic Forensic Toolkit. Our discussions with law makers, law enforcers, and forensic scientists inspired three specific areas. First, the ability to pinpoint exactly when a fingerprint was made would have serious implications for delivering justice. We have designed a synthetic enzyme-based system to tackle this. Second, detection of different types of bodily fluids at a crime scene, while leaving DNA uncontaminated, would be of benefit. We therefore designed a cell-free synthetic spray to highlight traces of blood, semen, saliva, and nasal mucus on surfaces. Finally, the quantification of traces of stainless steel on bone. For this, a chromate sensor form a previous iGEM project has been adapted.
https://teams.igem.org/1591	Software	The complexity in biological systems has limited genetic circuit design in synthetic biology. Without co-development and an open, proof-of-principle engineering platform, it is hard for synthetic biologists to manage this complexity. To address this problem, we developed CORE, an open and extensible software that allows users to design, share and cooperate in synthetic biology. CORE mainly consists of two closely interconnected modules. One is the open, crowdsourcing platform. It helps users design and redesign, share and reuse previous work according to the principle of modularized design. The other one is the design module embedded in the platform, which promotes genetic design automation based on ODE (ordinary differential equation) models and assists wet-lab practices through protocol management. In conclusion, the combination of a crowdsourcing platform and a novel design module makes complex design more accessible to synthetic biologists.
https://teams.igem.org/1592	Environment	With the expanding of human settlements and the development of civil engineering, the demand of novel cementation material is increasing rapidly. To echo such demand, we developed Euk.cement: a live eukaryotic cell based auto-cementation kit. By surface displayed silica binding peptides and secreted flocculating proteins, Euk.cement will target onto any silica containing particles, such as sands and rocks, and stick them together. This system will be automatically initiated only in dark with a light operated switch. While carbon dioxide released from the metabolism of cells will finally complete the calcium carbonate sedimentation. This economical and ecological friendly innovation can be utilized for a wide range of industrial or environmental applications, such as construction and restoration of building foundations, bridge piers, or even artificial reefs for aquaculture. Since we have exploited a new kind of marine yeast as chassis, the application field of eukaryotic synthetic biology has then been considerably broadened.
https://teams.igem.org/1593	Hardware	Abusing antibiotics has caused severe antibiotics contamination and resistance issues worldwide. Therefore, we USTC develop a device NDM with OD detector and optical interference path, recognition program based on RasberryPi and Arduino to detect antibiotics in natural water bodies. In NDM, there are two bacterial systems for measurement: ROSE, an engineered bacterial reporter system integrated with permeability modification, logic amplification circuit and quorum sensing, is able to adjust EGFP expression level, and NDM reads fluorescence intensity from ROSE to send results in high resolution. CACCI, chemotaxis and transmembrane protein-modified bacteria, are chemically covalently adhered to a polymer membrane. Deformation caused by CACCI motility can be recognized with optical interference and the interference pattern recognition program inside NDM will analyze the deformation, thus antibiotic situation in sample can be accurately told. Hope with our project, antibiotics issues can be solved in an accelerated way.
https://teams.igem.org/1594	Software	Hoping to generate a more direct rational circuit design, we develop BioBLESS that can automatically computes the structure of a digital gene circuit. Instead of looking for a general solution to the computational design challenge, we focus on digital circuits. Given a truth table where the inputs and outputs of Boolean gates take only 0/1 values, we convert it into Boolean Formula and get possible circuit schemes. To get reliable circuits, we select well-behaved circuits with the introduction of fitness scores which sufficiently consider the practical realizablity. Performance simulation and robustness analysis constituting the core of our evaluation module will shed light on how our devised circuits behave and examine the correspondence with truth tables. Moreover, our software keeps the compatibility of various methods or algorithms and reserves the space for users to redesign.
https://teams.igem.org/1595	Environment	Salmonid fish are among one of the leading agricultural exports worldwide. Unfortunately, thousands of these otherwise viable or edible fish are wasted each year to bacterial coldwater disease (BCWD). BCWD is a potentially lethal bacterial infection that currently lacks an effective industrial solution and is caused by the pathogen <i>Flavobacterium psychrophilum</i>. Our fishPHARM system offers a comprehensive treatment for BCWD and is composed of a biologically synthesized peptide integrated into a fish tag drug delivery mechanism to safely administer our treatment to infected fish without environmental harm. Recent research has shown that the entericidin B peptide provides resistance against <i>F. psychrophilum</i>, thereby acting as a curative agent for infected fish. In order to determine the most effective BCWD biological treatment, we aim to engineer <i>E. coli</i> for the production of over twenty different entericidins and to test their activity against <i>F. psychrophilum</i>.

https://teams.igem.org/1597	Energy	IGEM Groningen 2015 wants to harvest the energy of salt water, also known as Blue Energy. Blue energy uses ion exchange membranes to separate the sodium and chloride ions found in sea water. The currently used ion exchange membranes are expensive and their efficiency degrades over time . We aim to overcome these disadvantages by replacing those membranes with a bacterial biofilm. The biofilm completely consists of our modified Bacillus Subtilis. One of the two types of currently used ion membranes, the cation exchange membrane, only allows passage of positively charged sodium ions. A characteristics of this membrane is its negative charge. In order to generate blue bio energy, we aimed to overexpress genes whose encoding extracellular proteins provide the biofilm with an negative charge and increased rigidity. In result, our biofilm resembling the cation exchange membrane should be able to generate blue energy.
https://teams.igem.org/1598	WIKI	Current research suggests that gut microbes secrete neuroactive compounds that act on the gut-brain axis and play an important role in healthy brain function. The UCL iGEM team has developed novel synthetic psychobiotics that mimic these neuromodulatory strategies identified in endogenous intestinal strains. We have designed safe therapeutic devices that target metabolic pathways for neurochemical biosynthesis. Additionally, we have assessed biocontainment and integrated a sensor detecting mood-related physiological changes in the gut environment. In any year, mental health conditions affect one in four of us and available small molecule treatments have associated stigma and side effects. We believe that, besides aiding in the better understanding of the communication between gut microbiota and brain, our work will also lay a foundation for novel user-friendly treatments for mental health conditions.

https://teams.igem.org/1600	Health & Medicine	Postprandial glycemic spikes (PGSs) occur when the concentration of blood sugar rises and falls following a meal. For diabetics, complications resulting from PGSs are the leading cause of death. Of the 100 million U.S. hyperglycemic patients, twenty-six percent regulate spikes through self-administered insulin, which is costly or easily misdosed. To reduce the amplitude of PGSs, we designed a sugar-concentration-dependent microbial system that delays and reduces the absorption of glucose and fructose from the small intestine. To show proof of principle, we introduced two genetic devices into E.coli to polymerize glucose into glycogen, to polymerize fructose into levan, and to induce cell lysis to release the polymerized sugar into the gut, thus reducing the amplitude of the glycemic spike. This microbial system, as a one-dose-fits-all solution, dynamically adjusts to glycemic spikes of fluctuating amplitudes. This system is a safer alternative to dosage-dependent drug therapies to stabilize blood sugar levels.
https://teams.igem.org/1601	Environment	Nowadays, chewing gum is the second urban pollutant after cigarette butts. To clean chewing gum, specific machines are used but they are heavy and expensive. The time required is long and they use a large quantity of water. Besides economical aspects, chewing gums have an environmental impact. They are dangerous for the wildlife such as birds which thinks that it is bread, eats it and choke. In view of these alarming facts, we have decided to create a new environmentally-friendly way to clean our streets.   Our project is to create an E.coli strain that produces enzymes , which can degrade rubber polymers. We will use a combination of three enzymes: a laccase, a lipoxygenase or latex clearing protein (LCP) and a cytochrome C. The laccase known will oxidize the cytochrome C which will be previously light excited. Coupled with this later, the LCP will degrade synthetics polymers. 
https://teams.igem.org/1602	Hardware	3D-printing has become a highly applicable technique, improving numerous engineering processes including rapid prototyping. The technique allows the production of almost any imaginable structure. A variety of 3D-printing methods have been developed, for instance Stereolithography (SLA) - enabling the realization of many utilization options. We produce monomer compounds in E.coli, nominal xylitol, itaconic acid and ethylene glycol by metabolic engineering. Those compounds were combined by a chemical hydrolysis reaction creating a pre-polymer. The final polymerization reaction is promoted when defined light waves hit the pre-polymer liquid transforming it into a solid polymer. We want to use this technology to advance medical engineering. In cooperation with Synenergene, we developed an application scenario to identify the best way to provide an accurate on-site matching prosthesis to victims of forced amputations. Fast and accurate production of those parts in one piece could render quick and easy help, especially in crisis areas.
https://teams.igem.org/1603	New Application	Biologically based manufacturing can produce numerous types of complex products. One of the biggest problems is the robustness of the system. Great progress has been made with industrial production techniques, but contaminations are still a considerable problem the industry faces. Insufficient control of contaminations in bioreactors could compromise entire batches, resulting in high expenses. Team Chalmers Gothenburg will solve the contamination problem once and for all using a novel strategy to detect and combat contaminations in yeast based bioreactors. The solution involves two genetic systems, one signaling and contamination detection system and one repair system for survival after contamination termination. These two systems are made from innovative uses of ESDSA repair, CRISPR technology and MAPK cascades. The two systems also set the foundation for a whole range of new applications, from DNA assembly to laboratory markers. More will be revealed in this study in scarlet.
https://teams.igem.org/1604	Energy	Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC) technology is rapidly evolving due to interest in producing sustainable electricity. Typically, MFCs exploit complex mixtures of microorganisms in which the identity of the microorganisms are unknown. The undefined nature of the source of electrons leads to limitations in the control and optimization of the MFC. We, therefore, attempted to improve the MFC platform by exclusively using <i>E. coli</i> engineered to survive under stressful conditions. <i>E. coli</i> cells were modified to express a light-driven proton pump, which required the assembly of a cofactor synthesis pathway. The proton gradient generated upon the exposure of light was then used by the bacteria to synthesize ATP, thereby turning <i>E. coli</i> into a type of pseudo-autotroph. Furthermore we investigated different genetic approaches to improve the secretion of electrons from <i>E. coli</i>. We built an MFC prototype with our engineered bacteria that are driven by light, which we called Solar pMFC.
https://teams.igem.org/1605	Food & Nutrition	Fixed nitrogen is an essential component of artificial fertilizers. However, given the heavy environmental and economic costs of fertilizers, interest in biological nitrogen fixation has recently increased. One possible alternative to artificial fertilizers is to transfer the highly active Cyanothece sp. ATCC 51142 nitrogen-fixing (nif) cluster to plant chloroplasts. However, further characterization of the cluster is needed before that can be done. We attempted to determine the set of genes from the large Cyanothece nif cluster necessary for nitrogen fixation and inserted our selected genes into two plasmids. In order to further characterize our minimal cluster, we developed CRISPR/dCas9 knockdown plasmids and overexpression plasmids. Additionally, we studied a genome-scale model of nitrogen-fixing E. coli through flux balance analysis that will help us optimize cofactors necessary for nitrogen fixation. We identified potential genetic interventions and media modifications that could improve cell energy levels, growth, and production of fixed nitrogen.
https://teams.igem.org/1606	Food & Nutrition	People with celiac disease have to consume gluten free food because gluten creates an auto-immune response in their body. However, gluten free food is a lot more expensive than normal food. That is why, we decided to find a solution to this problem by taking kumamolisin and putting it in a vector of yeast that has alpha secretion factor then putting the plasmid in yeast. The yeast will produce and secrete kumamolisin enzyme to its external environment and will destroys gluten while the bread continues to be fermented. We also prepared a gluten detection kit using green fluroscent protein in PQLP aminoacid sequence. If kumamolisin cuts the gluten it will have cut GFP as well so there will be no colour but if it does not cut the gluten than it also has not cut GFP so green color will be observed.
https://teams.igem.org/1607	High School	Aiming at making drug delivering more accurate and efficient, we constructed a switch-like system called "Switchgen". Our system is designed to release a fused protein to deliver an effector protein to the targeted cells on which a certain surface antigen is detected in the way of binding the specific antibody connected to the fused protein. The specific binding and the short range activating allow our system to perform a high quality of delivering as we expected. We purposed to use FRET to verify if our idea could be put into practice and believed that we will achieve impressive results. The value of our project is at the same time demonstrated in its variety. With different effector protein linked to the fused protein, it provides us with infinite choices: to relieve pain, to massacre cancerous cells, to activate downstream reactions venturing a promising thinking in medication.
https://teams.igem.org/1608	High School	Fire can kill life when it gets out of control. Fire is an oxidation-reduction reaction of chemical process. Flame combustion starts from three main elements, so-called fire triangle, that is, heat, oxygen and fuel. Fire can expand further by the chain reaction induced by active free radicals made from the combustion. Fire retardant materials have wide applications to slow or even stop the fire. However, the major of these materials are synthesized from chemicals, and many of them have been proven as toxic. As a result, natural biomaterials with fire retardant properties are increasingly important. Casein and wool have been reported as effective fire retardant biomaterials. This year, we are going to analyze the components in casein and wool as well as figure out why they can retard the fire. By this knowledge, we can design and genetically engineer the bacteria to be novel fire retardant biomaterials without toxicity.
https://teams.igem.org/1610	WIKI	Granzyme B is a serine protease that is an essential part of the immune system. In response to inflammation or tumors, Granzyme B is overexpressed and enters target cells to induce apoptosis. However, high levels of Granzyme B also result in random cleavage of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, such as elastin and decorin, which help to maintain tissue structure and elasticity. Our team has constructed a system that inhibits Granzyme B activity in the ECM without affecting its intracellular functions. In humans, Antichymotrypsin (ACT) is an extracellular protease inhibitor, which we have modified to allow for Granzyme B inhibition. Of the many diseases associated with ECM degradation, we focus on preventing damage from both arthritis and prolonged wound healing. We've engineered a semipermeable bandage to deliver the Granzyme B inhibitor topically without bacterial contamination. Our system is capable of maintaining a healthy immune system response while protecting ECM proteins.
https://teams.igem.org/1611	WIKI	Cancer thrives by preventing the immune system from targeting tumor cells. While current immunotherapies use dendritic cells to activate T-cells towards specific tumor antigens, they remain expensive and of variable efficiency against tumor immunosuppressive environment. To address these issues, our team mainly focused on engineering a <i>S. cerevisiae</i> yeast immunotherapy that was ultimately tested <i>in vivo</i> on mice presenting melanoma. Three complementary strategies were combined: First, in order to modulate the tumor environment, yeast secreting immune modulators, GM-CSF and IFNgamma, were encapsulated into alginate beads and injected in tumors. Secondly, to break the immune tolerance against cancer cells, T4 and T8 lymphocytes were elicited by a yeast antigen display system. Last, to deliver cytotoxic compounds solely in the tumor environment, a yeast hypoxia bio-sensor was designed. A side project consisted in engineering <i>E. coli</i> to drive MAIT lymphocytes against cancer cells instead of their original targets, parasitized cells.

https://teams.igem.org/1614	Foundational Advance	Like Proteins, RNA folds into a unique, functionally relevant 3D structure  as a catalytic ribozyme or an aptamer detecting and selectively binding a ligand. To obtain these functional RNAs, simple transcription of a DNA sequence is sufficient. Yet finding the few functional sequences has so far been challenging and has impeded its widespread use in synthetic biology. As a part of our project, we develop a software that drastically reduces both required resources and effort of directed evolution, as it creates aptamers for virtually any molecule through computational simulation. With the goal to provide the iGEM community with the power of RNA, we develop a toolbox consisting of easy to use standards for in vitro RNA usage, practical readouts and means for mRNA editing. To reach the end user with our work, we create straightforward tests for the detection of numerous noxious substances.

Of these drugs, opiates contribute to the most deaths due to acute poisonings, whilst a number of contaminants in so-called party drugs have recently been implicated in a spate of fatalities in Scotland. It is the aim of The University of Edinburgh iGEM team to develop a multiplexed, enzyme-based biosensor to semi-quantitatively measure heroin levels, detect PMA in MDMA and DNP in diet pills. With this biosensor the team hopes to contribute to the efforts in harm reduction related to illicit drug use. We have engaged with both Drug Consumption Rooms and pill testing services with the goal to have them utilise our biosensor in their attempts to lessen morbidity and mortality.

https://teams.igem.org/1617	WIKI	iGEM Berlin is trying to clear our water of plastics, which pose a threat to our environment. In detail, we are focusing on microplastics present in various everyday products, which find their way into the wastewater treatment plant before ending up in the oceans. Now we are constructing the Enzymatic Flagellulose to degrade microplastics into biodegradable compounds. It consists of a surface made up of cellulose, which acts as a biocompatible carrier, to which bacterial flagella will be immobilized via a cellulose-binding domain. The single flagellum subunits, also known as flagellin, will be interlinked with plastic degrading enzymes. Using flagella as a scaffold for enzymes has two major advantages. Firstly, it enables the creation of a three-dimensional reactive nanostructure that has an increased specific surface with highly catalytic activity. Secondly, flagella may consist of various different active sites, which will enable the combination of multiple enzymatic steps in close proximity.
https://teams.igem.org/1618	Food & Nutrition	Colon cancer is the second most common cause of cancer deaths with 30,000 cases diagnosed every year in the United Kingdom. Studies suggest that resistant starches may reduce colon cancer by enabling colonic bacteria to produce short-chain fatty acids, including butyrate. Our project took two approaches to increase colonic butyrate. The first approach was to develop a screen for enzymes that could transfer acyl/butyryl groups to alpha 1,4 carbohydrates in bacteria and plants. To support this we modelled and modified carbohydrate branching. Enzymatic modification of carbohydrates could also provide environmentally-friendly methods for the production of modified starches used in a wide range of industries. The second approach aimed to transfer the butyrate biosynthetic pathway to Escherichia coli. Our work could be applied to the production of butyrylated starches for consumption as prebiotics or butyrate-producing probiotics. We also investigated and compared the feasibility of testing these products for efficacy in humans.
https://teams.igem.org/1619	Environment	Methane is the third most prevalent greenhouse gas in the earth's atmosphere. In a time span of 20 years has it a global warming potential that is about 84 times that of carbon dioxide. Techniques for the reuse of emitted methane are cost and time-intensive and are therefore rarely used. </br> Our goal is to limit the emission of methane by developing an <i>Escherichia coli (E. coli)</i> based model that filters methane out of the air and converts it into biomass. The first part involves breaking down methane to methanol with the enzyme complex, soluble methane monooxygenase from <i>Methylococcus capsulatus</i>. The second part is converting methanol into biomass by establishing the Ribulose-Monophosphate pathway from <i>Bacillus methanolicus</i> in <i>E. coli</i>. Lastly, a filter will be created that contains the modified <i>E. coli</i> and filters the surrounding air to facilitate methane uptake and breakdown; to be used in any closed air system!
https://teams.igem.org/1620	Manufacturing	As different insects with varying habits generate different diseases, repellent becomes an effective solution to combat this insects.The high toxicity related to high concentrations of the current topical insect repellent in the market (DEET) and the relationship between concentration and longevity generate the need for more efficient and durable products.The D-limonene, compound also proven safe for use on human skin. To extend the duration of the limonene, the use of synthetic biology for continuous production was proposed by this project. However, the limonene production in predecessors attempts using bacterial were not efficient, probably due to the fact that the enzyme responsible for the production of geranyl phosphate in limonene was insoluble, the limonene synthase. The gene circuit comprises a promoter activated by osmotic shock inducing production of the enzyme limonene synthase. An osmotic shock is a simple way of inducing the production of chaperones and foldases, creating our repelent.
https://teams.igem.org/1621	WIKI	In modern medicine, fast detection and differentiation of diseases is a crucial and fundamental task. Typical ELISA-based assays are time-consuming and expensive. We propose an advanced procedure for the simultaneous detection of various diseases in a fast and inexpensive manner, the DiaCHIP. Our approach is based on the interaction of antibodies with their respective antigens. Different antigens are immobilized on a protein array generated by cell-free protein expression, using the corresponding DNA array as a template. Placed in a microfluidic chamber, the protein array is incubated with a patients blood sample. The interaction between an antibody in the sample and the corresponding immobilized antigen results in a local change of the optical thickness of the surface. This change can be detected using a label-free and real-time measurement technology called iRIf (imaging Reflectometric Interference). Offering simultaneous screening for several diseases, our DiaCHIP has strong potential to improve future diagnostics.
https://teams.igem.org/1622	Environment	What if plastic could cure people? Today, scientists are looking for new ways to synthesize drugs. As one of the major pollutants, plastic waste is a growing resource with <b>25 million tons</b> produced in 2014 in Europe alone. Because of their composition, plastics have a very slow degradation rate and produce persistent organic pollutants. This leads to an increase of <b>plastic pollution</b> and an accumulation of plastic microparticules in our ecosystem, especially in the oceans. <b>PlastiCure</b> is a biological system designed in <i>E.coli</i> to degrade <b>polyethylene terephthalate</b> and use the degradation products to synthesize a commonly used antibiotic: <b>Erythromycin A</b>. For this, exogenous DNA sequences are integrated in multiple operons to express the <b>biodegradation</b> pathway (22kb) and the <b>biosynthesis</b> pathway (55kb). PlastiCure is a very innovative project to address an environmental issue, plastic pollution, by degrading plastic into a profitable transformation product and thus increase efforts in plastic recycling.
https://teams.igem.org/1624	High School	<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is a toxic colorless and odorless gas that results in thousands of fatalities a year, yet most detectors are based upon sight and sound that exclude the blind and the deaf. Furthermore, current sensors rely upon upon the presence of electricity and power, and are thus unable to act in scenarios of natural disasters when CO leaks are most likely.</p> <p>This project introduces a CO-sensing mechanism into <i>E.coli</i> using a CooA transcription activator and corresponding pCoof promoter to regulate the expression of a methyl salicylate pathway (pchBA and BSMT genes). The pathway converts the endogenous molecule chorismate into salicylic acid then methyl salicylate, producing a wintergreen smell in the presence of CO. This CO sensor has implications for not only the disabled, but also commercial use in cases of natural disaster due to its cost efficiency and transportability.</p>
https://teams.igem.org/1626	Foundational Advance	Both technical and social obstacles hinder widespread use of synthetic biology approaches. One technical challenge is optimization of multi-enzyme pathway gene expression. Viral 2A sequences can improve translational efficiency of polycistronic encoded proteins. Here we demonstrated the utility of this technology in yeast by expressing genes to produce compounds in the beta carotenoid pathway. Furthermore, we have developed a mathematical model to estimate gene order for optimal biosynthetic production using 2A sequence and present it as a community tool to streamline future applications. Finally, accurate and widespread public knowledge regarding the use of genetically modified organisms is vital for increasing social acceptance of synthetic biology. We have correlated word usage to opinions regarding biotechnology to inform future efforts to engage the public.
https://teams.igem.org/1627	Foundational Advance	After an organism is reprogrammed with a genetic device, the device will often mutate, or break, decreasing the metabolic load on the organism and giving it a competitive advantage. This commonly allows the organism with the broken genetic device to dominate the population, undermining the purpose of the original reprogramming. Our goal is to characterize sequences within genes and plasmids that are more likely to mutate, since our research suggests that certain devices are more easily broken than others. We expanded on this research by transforming four E. coli strains with fluorescent protein plasmids. Breaking times varied noticeably between strains, suggesting that the hosts own genetic material also influenced device stability. Based on our findings, we decided to increase the stability of a few genetic devices, including the pDCAF3 plasmid, which the 2012 UT Austin iGEM team designed to allow E. coli to measure caffeine content through caffeine metabolism.
https://teams.igem.org/1628	Health & Medicine	Poly-&#947;-glutamic acid (&#947;-PGA) is an important, naturally occurring polyamide which has been widely used in foods, medicine, cosmetics and agriculture. We improved &#947;-PGA production in Bacillus amyloliquefaciens LL3 and the produced &#947;-PGA was made into drug releasing hydrogel. In this study, two strategies were employed to improve B. amyloliquefaciens LL3 &#947;-PGA production. First, we constructed a metabolic toggle switch to control the expression of odhA (encoding 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase), thus interrupting the TCA cycle and favoring the metabolic flux toward &#947;-PGA precursor-glutamate synthesis. Second, in order to balance the increase of endogenous glutamate production, we optimized the expression level of pgsBCA genes (responsible for &#947;-PGA synthesis) by replacing its native promoter with seven different promoters with various transcriptional activities. We finally constructed a &#947;-PGA production improved B. amyloliquefaciens strain. In the meantime, the drug releasing hydrogel, Pudding Health Kit, functioned well protecting the exposed skin and healing the wounds.
https://teams.igem.org/1629	High School	Lago de Guadalupe is the most extensive water body in State of Mexico. It is surrounded by industrial, agricultural and residential areas, the last one being responsible for 25% of the total contaminants. Among these is SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate), which is the principal component of detergents used in mexican households. The residues of detergents change the water's pH, turning it into a toxic and dangerous environment for more than 150 species that depend on this lake. Although there have been some studies for its treatment, nothing has been achieved. Our project consists in developing a bioremediation system to lower SDS levels in the water using two immobilized proteins, alkyl-sufatase and ferritin.

https://teams.igem.org/1631	Information Processing	How do Zebrafish get their stripes? Why do we have only 5 digits on each hand? Here's one possible answer: Turing Pattern. Turing Pattern is a type of spatial pattern suggested by the British mathematician Alan Turing. He proposed that these patterns could be created by the network of two chemicals which have different diffusion rates. This mechanism has been investigated for a long time. However, it was not easy to analyze patterns found on living systems because of its complexity and technical difficulty. We therefore reconstructed a Turing system using two advantages of synthetic biology; controllability and biological directness. By letting whole E. coli cells, whose motility were controlled, communicate with each other, we designed a system that works more ideally than any previous researches. This project should surely be a great step for understanding more about morphology and some other related fields of science.

Although each prisoner knows both player's cooperation mutually benefits each other, one will always defect when the individual is pursuing his or her own benefit. We will express this dilemma by using a genetic circuit centering in quorum sensing. We will also provide various strategies and aim to determine the best strategy in this game. By combining the idea with synthetic biology, we demonstrated this game among students. We also made our own pay-off matrix.</p> <p>In our project we will focus on the prisoners emotions as well.

https://teams.igem.org/1633	Health & Medicine	Opioids and opiates top the list of illicit drugs and cause the most burden of disease and drug-related deaths worldwide. The goal of this project is to develop a strategy to treat opioid addiction. We prepared exosomes (nano-sized vesicles secreted by endogenous cells) from cell factory that was engineered to express a rabies viral glycoprotein peptide (specifically recognize and target neuronal cells) on the exosomal membrane surface. By filling the exosomes with siRNA of the mu opioid receptor (MOR, a primary target for opioids) and injecting the exosomes into mouse bloodstream, we detected efficient passage of the siRNA through blood-brain barrier and specific accumulation of the siRNA in mouse brain. Consequently, siRNA-loaded exosomes significantly reduced MOR mRNA and protein levels in mice. To show the therapeutic potential, siRNA-loaded exosomes strongly restrained morphine-induced conditioned place preference in mice. This project may open up new avenues for future treatment of drug addiction.

We not only use the traditional channalrhodopsin,chR2, but some novel ones which have never been tested in C.elegans such as Blink. Then we use computer controlling our DIY light source to regulate channelrhodopsins activity and control the behaviours of C.elegans such as moving forwards or twisting effectively. We also express GFP,YFP, mcherry in E.coli. By combining the colorful microorgasims and C.elegans, we construct some interesting scenes to form a C.elegans' fancy world. This technology will help in researches on neuron's function and interaction. It may also be used in mechanical controlling system and the theraphy of movement defect.

However, there are few genetic tools available for metabolic engineering Archaea. Our goal is to develop some useful tools for synthetic biology of Archaea. Building on our past <i>M. maripaludis</i> projects, which created and characterized a mCherry reporter system and a recombinant mutant making geraniol, our team is now working to (1) create, characterize and model a ribosome-binding site (RBS) library using the mCherry reporter system and (2) model geraniol production of the recombinant <i>M. maripaludis</i> using flux balance analyses. Preliminary results have shown varying levels of expression in the RBS library, and increased geraniol yield from some growth substrates. Additionally, our team has initiated an Archaeal InterLab Study to further characterize the reproducibility of our mCherry reporter system.
https://teams.igem.org/1636	New Application	DNAorigami is a technique that allows the self-assembly of strands of DNA to engineer a complex shape; in this sense, the array of the base pairs within these strands changes their 3D conformation. Scientists have managed to create different designs and have proposed several applications for this tool. However, all the programmable strands are synthesized by chemical reactions in laboratories. By inserting these stands into a plasmid, transforming a competent bacteria and incubating it with the helper phage, we propose a biological self-replicative and self-assembling way to produce a custom-shaped DNAbot. This molecule has specific recognition sites for lead ions which when in contact, form a quadruplex structure able to capture the cations. Our work intends to give a new and successful methodology to produce this functional DNA structures and promote the use of DNA itself as a nanotechnology material.
https://teams.igem.org/1638	Manufacturing	The nowadays production methods of antibodies are not only time-consuming and costly but are at the expense of animal lives. Antibodies have many applications in research, diagnostics, and show great promise in treatment of cancer. But the advancement is held back due to the expensive and tiresome production. Therefore we propose an alternative to antibodies; peptide aptamers  produced in Escherichia coli (E. coli). The variable loop of the peptide aptamer is generated through a random nucleotide library and held together by an enzymatic inactive version of human Thioredoxin (hThx) as a scaffold protein. We are using the bacterial two-hybrid system to screen for functioning peptide aptamers that are able to bind our chosen target proteins (antigens). In this model bacteria expressing a functioning peptide aptamer will express Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP), which enables us to isolate them. To challenge the antibody tradition, we are also proposing a production model.

In our Project, we aimed to build mechanisms to cure both of these diseases, as one is causing each other. We decided to modify E.

https://teams.igem.org/1640	Village	Photosynthesis is a key biological pathway utilized by plants and algae to generate useable energy from sunlight. Chlorophyll is a green pigment in photosynthetic organisms that aids in the manufacture of energy. Our aim is to engineer and express 13 genes of the chlorophyll-a biosynthetic pathway from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in E. coli. While this pathway has been well characterised, reproduction of this process in non-photosynthetic organisms has not been successful. Our second goal is to synthetically engineer Photosystem II in E. coli, which consists of 17 genes. Photosystem II is a multi-subunit protein complex that generates oxygen and electrons, by oxidation of water molecules. Transferring these electrons to a hydrogenase would potentially lead to production of hydrogen on an industrial scale. Our goals are the first step towards clean and sustainable hydrogen production as a viable future energy source.

Also, microbes with the system inserted acquire the concept of life span so that some dangerous bacterias will come to death in time before they cause any biohazard. Inverted components which based on recombinase system are introduced in our system. One inverted component is able to calculate a period of time, while several inverted components comprise of one time cycle. When we combine several time cycles together, a sequence with a timer's function has been successfully formed. Through altering recombinases and their specific sites to different matches, we can get distinctive time cycles. We believe that the system will be of great importance to biological devices with time-related concepts.
https://teams.igem.org/1642	WIKI	This year, we will engineer a recombinant cyanobacteria to achieve biodesalination, which means to extract sodium chloride from seawater through biological membranes. There are already some methods to convert saltwater into freshwater, such as distillation and reverse osmosis. However, the high energy consumption of these technologies has limited their application. Therefore the development of an innovative, low-energy biological desalination process, by biological membranes of cyanobacteria, would be very attractive. Many cyanobacteria possess salt-tolerance mechanisms, among which sodium export is the most important one. Halorhodopsin is a light-driven inward-directed chloride pump from halobacteria. We will functionally express it in cyanobacteria to drive influx of chloride together with sodium, thus conferring cyanobacteria the ability to absorb salts to a significant degree.

https://teams.igem.org/1644	Health & Medicine	Helicobacter pylori is a stomach dwelling bacterium that inhabits the stomach of more than half of the worlds human population. With antibiotic resistance genes spreading among microbial communities, common antibiotics used to treat H. pylori induced gastric distresses are losing efficacy. UMassD proposes to create an alternative. An enzyme released by H. pylori which cleaves urea and releases ammonia as a byproduct  creating a pH buffered microenvironment. It has been shown in previous studies that various peptides can inhibit urease activity in vitro. The aim of our project is to engineer E. coli with a plasmid encoding a positively regulated, pH sensitive promoter. The low pH will initiate the transcription of an inhibitory peptide coupled with a twin-arginine translocase leader sequence. As a result, the decreased production of ammonia should inhibit H. pyloris buffering capacity, reducing its ability to persist within the stomach.
https://teams.igem.org/1645	WIKI	CRISPR-Cas9 is an exciting tool for synthetic biologists because it can target and edit genomes with unprecedented specificity. Our team is attempting to re-engineer CRISPR to make it more flexible and easier to use. Were making it easy to test different sgRNA designs: restriction sites added to the sgRNA backbone allow 20 nucleotide target sequences to be swapped without excessive cloning. Additionally, were applying recent research on viable mutations within Cas9s PAM-interacting domain to design (d)Cas9 variants that bind to novel PAM sites, moving towards the goal of a suite of variants that can bind any desired sequence. We believe our re-engineered CRISPR-Cas9 will give biologists increased ability to optimize targeting in many applications. The application we chose to explore is a proof-of-concept antiviral system defending the model plant Arabidopsis against Cauliflower Mosaic Virus, which would benefit from testing a large number of possible sgRNAs in the viral genome.

https://teams.igem.org/1647	Information Processing	We intend to construct a threshold detection system which could generate pulse output when the input reaches predefined threshold. This type of module is very important in biology systems, because it can function as a signal filter, a signal multiplier or a time-frequency domain signal convertor (like the Hodgkin-Huxley model in action potential generation). To achieve threshold detection, we set up a red light sensor to obtain input and a negative feedback circuit to generate pulse output with good intensity and modularity. In our case, along with the other two systems we built, the module is proved to have potential application in biological computer and homeostasis maintenance. The former aids in storing addressable binary data in living cells while the latter helps prevent dental caries (tooth decay) by controlling the population of Streptococcus mutans at a satisfactory level.

https://teams.igem.org/1649	New Application	The most cellular memories are limited to protein levels currently, which are transient, instantaneous and unapparent. To overcome these shortcuts, we design a system to achieve the storage of information by a transient stimulation but use a long-lasting response. The two processes are divided into separated bacterial strains to play as the Recorder and the Saver. The system is designed to be activated and deactivated via light- regulated fusion proteins, which then active protein synthesis to complete the process. The information storage would be accomplished by conjugation, which cannot be carried out in usual time because of the specific gene deletion. When the memory needs to be erased, the CRISPR-Cas9 system in the Saver would be activated. By design such a cellular memory technology, we make a bacterial memory storage device. And together with biological transistor and other bio-electronic component, we can preview the prototype of the biological computer.

Comparing with current chemical or physical detecting method, biological detecting method has the following advantages. One is that the cost of microorganism is much lower, and it reproduces efficiently. On the other hand, the genetic circuit, which is modified based on the synthetic biology, is able to amplify the micro signals, and improve the accuracy. Most importantly, its more convenient for users to operate with our hardware. In the future, the project will focus on detecting accuracy, detecting range and detecting type. The detecting method will be applied to POCT and be launched on the market ultimately.
https://teams.igem.org/1652	Health & Medicine	Cell differentiation is the focus of much exciting research, but the current hypothesis on how cells specialize depends on epigenetic modification  the activation and suppression of a large part of the genome at once. However, this approach does not explain many complex and finely-tuned phenomena in the cell. We believe that a special genetic network, known as a tri-stable switch, can model cell differentiation. This network would allow a cell to specialize from a quasi-pluripotent state to one of two differentiated states. By repurposing native transcription factors, we can build such a switch in the organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae, or bakers yeast. If this network can indeed achieve tri-stability, it may give us insight on the mechanisms of differentiation in stem cells, and bring us a step closer to construction synthetic stem cells in the lab.

https://teams.igem.org/1655	Energy	Climate change is argued to be one of the greatest challenges faced by mankind. Its primary cause is believed to be man-made CO2 emissions from transportation and electricity production. To tackle the issue of transportation emissions, we want to produce sustainable propane in Escherichia coli using cellulosic feedstock. The pathway is a patchwork of 10 different enzymes from different organisms, such as Mycobacterium marinum and Bacillus subtilis. We built a model of the pathway to identify its bottlenecks and concentrate our engineering efforts on them. To elevate our propane from a food crop -based first generation biofuel to the second generation, we are integrating a secretion system for cellulose hydrolysing enzymes. To innovatively enhance our production system, we are bringing the two final enzymes of our pathway into close proximity by fusing them with micelle-forming amphiphilic proteins. This increases theoretical yield, bringing us one step closer to commercially viable biopropane.

However,the weeds have somehow developed to be resistant to the herbicide because of the more and more extensive use of the herbicide. Therefore, people have to raise the amount of herbicide used in agricultural industry year by year, but the increased amount of herbicide have caused a lot of harmful effect such as toxic substance remaining, crop growth being inhibited and so on. In order to solve the problem, a novel use of herbicide has been figured out the mix of herbicide. The mix use of the herbicide has plenty of benefits including decreasing the dose, increasing the efficacy, decreasing the poison residual and expanding the weed control spectrum.

Varroas attack the honey bees; Apis cerena and Apis mellifera. The European Commission laboratories reported Varroa as the largest single cause of bee mortality. This parasitic mite sucks bees' hemolymph. The hemolymph contains Juvenile Hormone which helps development and reproduction of Varroa mite so it can maintains it's life cycle. There are many drugs for Varroasis treatment but they have some disadvantages; like bee deaths, colony collapses or changing taste of the honey. The purpose of our study is to repell the mites by synthesizing essential oils by Escherichia Coli to get cheaper and more natural solution.

Considering the adverse effect that may be caused by bad yogurt, our team aims to create a handy detector for pathogenic bacteria in yogurt. Autoinducer2 (AI-2), a signal molecule in quorum sensing system, serves as the key of our project. We constructed the AI-2 response pathway of Salmonella in Lactobacillus. Produced by pathogenic bacteria, the extracellular AI-2 will enter the cytoplasm of our engineered bacteria, and then lead to the expression of the report gene. As pathogenic bacteria produce AI-2 constantly, our engineered bacteria will make the existence of pathogenic bacteria visible to naked eyes. Furthermore, our genetically engineered Lactobacillus can be used directly in yogurt fermentation, which will make the detecting process even more convenient.
https://teams.igem.org/1667	Village	<p>  With increased agriculture activities around the world, it becomes a common practice to use pesticides to manage pest problem. Runoff can carry field pesticide into aquatic environment while wind can carry them to other fields, potentially affecting other species. Over time, repeated application increases pest resistance and facilitate the pest resurgence. Further, especially in China, toxic pesticide residues on green vegetable and fruits become a major public health problem. </p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to provide a solution, we design an engineered bacterium, secreting the OMP enzyme to degrade the common toxic pesticide residues. Its secretion is under the temperature control and can only be activated at specified temperature. To avoid the secondary pollution, a UV-induced suicide gene is inserted into the bacteria: upon exposure to UV or sunshine, the suicide procedure is induced. This purpose of the design is to remove toxic pesticide safely without affecting the environment. </p>
https://teams.igem.org/1668	Environment	The aim of our project is to create a brand-new system to kill termites. We chose two kinds of toxins which are safe and environmentally friendly to eliminate termites. We have cloned genes coding insecticidal toxic proteins from Photorhabdus luminescens TT01, a bacteria poisonous to numerous insects, and express them in E.coli. We enhance the production of Avermectin in S.A. Then, we prepared cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) , and generated the nanofibrous microspheres (NCM) self-assembled from CNC as bacteria carriers, in order to reduce the loss, improve transport efficiency, and target the carrying to aimed location and preventing bacteria from releasing into the environment. Finally, a series of simulation experiments have been conducted. They can help us to understand the cellulase, and confirm the terminator are efficient. Based on the result of simulation, we improved a device to monitor and terminate termites for better achieving.
https://teams.igem.org/1669	High School	Butanol has proven to be effective as a biofuel and can be used in internal combustion engines without modification, thus reducing the need for already scarce oil. In nature, bacteria of Clostridium genus have been shown to produce butanol from butanoic acid. In the present study, C. acetobutylicum metabolic pathway for butanol production was introduced into E. coli via a construct, consisting of three genes (CtfA, CtfB and BdhB). Polypeptide CtfAB converts butyrate to butyryl-CoA, which is then transformed to butanol by means of BdhB dehydrogenase. Butyrate is formed as an intermediate product in a reaction pathway of direct biological conversion of waste. We successfully composed an optimized system of bioreactors to produce pure butanol and use all side products formed. In the first stage the waste is converted to biogas, natural fertilizer and butyrate, the latter being efficiently transformed to biobutanol in the second stage.
https://teams.igem.org/1670	Health & Medicine	iGEM Manchester-Grazs aim is to take the first steps in the development of a novel technology for drug delivery by developing self-regulating, drug-producing bacteria. In the future, they could be incorporated into patients gut microflora to secrete medicines directly inside the body. We focused on the treatment of early stages of Parkinsons disease, for which the current treatment involves oral administration of L-DOPA. To control the bacterial L-DOPA production in the gut, we plan to develop a multidimensional, cell density-dependent auto-regulation system that could also be used to control other multistep enzyme pathways. Since Manchester-Graz is an inter-European Team, the Manchester sub-team is working on L-DOPA biosynthesis in <i>E. coli</i> BL21(DE3) and Nissle 1917, while the Graz sub-team is developing the regulation system in the aforementioned strains. The project will be combined in a way that the regulation system would control the rate of biosynthesis for the accurate dosage.
https://teams.igem.org/1671	High School	The Inscriptions on Precipice are one of the greatest traditional Chinese relics. Due to having been carved in open areas plus the exposure to sunshine and acid raindrops, the Inscriptions are weathered readily. Currently methods to solve this phenomenon are not used properly sometimes which occasionally cause the damage to the Inscriptions. We aim at using microorganism method, which is putting a plasmid that has the ability to convert bio-oriented Oxaloacetic Acid to Oxalate Acid into the E.coil, inducing the cell and reacting with one component of the Inscriptions--Calcium Carbonate--to generate nearly insoluble Calcium Oxalate Monohydrate to adhere to the Inscriptions for protection. Another E.coil with the ability to secrete lipase has also been constructed; adding this cell when we cleaning the Inscriptions will resolve the oil substance on the surface. By constructing these products, we are able to protect the relics both from human errors and from natural damnification.

https://teams.igem.org/1673	WIKI	Every sequence of DNA hides a secret. Concealed throughout any genetic construct are <b>mutation hotspots</b>, DNA motifs prone to high rates of mutation. Once a mutation occurs at one of these sites, a mutant may rapidly overtake the population due to evolutionary selective pressure. Our team has compiled decades of research into an algorithm that is able to eliminate these hotspots, reducing the risk of mutation for any gene without altering its function. We have also devised strategies for improving the evolutionary stability of entire genetic circuits, and have created new bacterial strains with their genomes engineered to better resist and repair mutations. Our foundational advance has the potential to revolutionize the way synthetic biologists optimize their genes, by looking beyond simple codon adaptation to consider the stability, safety, and reliability of DNA parts. <b>Join us as we expose the menaces lurking in your DNA...</b>
https://teams.igem.org/1674	WIKI	Hair loss affects roughly 1.5 billion people worldwide. The trigger for male pattern baldness is believed to be dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a derivative of testosterone. We have created a system in which two different engineered bacterium are combined in a custom-made comb manufactured in a 3D printer, working together to break down DHT, treating the problem at its root. We engineered Bacillus Subtilis, to secrete 3&#945;-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3-&#945;-HSD), an enzyme which reduces DHT to a non-steroidically active compound, using NADPH and NADH as cofactors. In addition, we genetically engineered Escherichia Coli to overproduce NADPH, enabling the enzymatic reaction to take place and driving it in the right direction. The two strains can be combined easily and cleanly with the help of our comb, providing a user-friendly tool and a novel, promising direction for future hair loss treatments.
https://teams.igem.org/1675	New Application	Precise artificial pH control is a worldwide concern because fluctuation of pH can tremendously influence the cells performance. So BIT-CHINA designed an intelligent pH-Controller inside the cell. Our pH-Controller contains two sub-systems. One is resistance system, and the other is fine-regulation system. Resistance system can make bacteria survive in an expanded range of pH. Fine-regulation system is used to adjust the environmental pH by synthesis of acid or alkali. Several kinds of recombinase were applied in this sub-system to achieve various regulation effectiveness. The two sub-systems working together allows for lowered artificial pH regulation costs in industrial fermentation, meanwhile the two systems also can regulate the pH of soil, because the hosts with our pH-Controller will maintain high efficiency when the environmental pH is not optimal and they can adjust the environmental pH as we expect. Combined with the projects we did before, our project can achieve more functions.
https://teams.igem.org/1676	Energy	The world is facing an impending energy crisis due to our over-reliance on fossil fuels, which are rapidly being depleted. Hence, there is an urgent need to explore alternative energy sources that are renewable and affordable. A microbial fuel cell (MFC) is an attractive solution to the global energy crisis. It is a device that utilizes microorganisms to convert chemical energy stored in various organic or inorganic compounds to electrical current. In our project, we seek to explore the usage of Shewanella bacteria in MFCs. We are performing flux balance analysis on the metabolic network of Shewanella and are genetically perturbing different nodes in the network to determine if the power output of the MFC can be enhanced. Additionally, we are developing and characterizing new genetic parts to aid us in our engineering of the Shewanella bacteria.
https://teams.igem.org/1677	Asia	Intracellular bacterial symbionts are useful allies for a wide range of eukaryotes. Endosynbio aims to lay the groundwork to recreate this powerful relationship for therapeutic use. Endosymbionts endowed with the ability to enter, survive, and replicate stably within the mammalian cytoplasm could provide hosts with in vivo protein production. This technology would have the potential to treat monogenic disorders - in lieu of genome-level modifications - as well as a broad range of peptide-related conditions. This year, we optimised entry of three bacterial species (E. coli, Synechocystis PCC6803 and Lactococcus lactis) into mammalian cells and assayed them for intrinsic compatibility to the cytosolic environment. In the future, endosymbionts will be used as synthetic organelles, enabling a whole new field of synthetic biology - endosynbiology.
https://teams.igem.org/1678	Village	Food fermentation is practiced by every culture in the world, and is especially widespread throughout the Indian subcontinent. Although fermentation enriches foods with some essential vitamins and amino acids, many regions of the subcontinent still suffer from high malnutrition. We are addressing this problem by engineering <i>S. cerevisiae</i> and lactobacilli, commonly found in Indian fermented rice dishes, to enrich foods with vitamins A, B2, and B12, and bioavailable iron. </br> We also implemented a differentiation system for reducing the fitness cost of over-expression of multiple pathways, and an easy E. coli sensor for measuring vitamin concentration using a riboswitch. </br> Our user-centered approach incorporates a low-cost and open hardware framework, both for growing and distributing starter cultures, and for quality control. This will give local affected populations power over their own food, as opposed to other GMO nutritional enrichment strategies, by allowing them to grow their own source of vitamins.
https://teams.igem.org/1679	Measurement	This summer, we are trying to design a platform responsed to electromagnetic signal. This platform is composed of 2 sessions : magnetic receiver and thermosensitive regulator. For magnetic receiver, we chose ferritin, the iron-storage protein in organisms, which could synthesize ferric oxihydroxide core in its hollow protein shell. When exposed to electromagnetic field, the ferric oxihydroxide core would be heated, which would trigger thermosensitive regulator. For thermosensitive regulator, we chose RNA thermometer and constructed a thermosensitive T7 RNA polymerase. RNA thermometer is a structured RNA which could expose RBS only when heated. The thermosensitive T7 RNA polymerase is a normal T7 RNA polymerase at the selected locus of which was inserted by a temperature-sensitive intein, which could self-splice at specific temperature.
https://teams.igem.org/1680	WIKI	For this years project Team Tuebingen designed a system aimed at capturing a snapshot of an expression controlling biosensor. In order to permanently memorise the sensor state of the snapshot time point in cells we use an altered version of the DNA recombinase Cre to switch on a luciferase reporter. The ability to quickly capture the current state of the sensor is achieved by fusing Cre with two copies of the protein Dronpa, that oligomerises after illumination and thereby cages and inhibits the recombinase. Because the oligomerisation of Dronpa is reversible through another wavelength, we can control the activity of the recombinase and fine tune the read out of the luciferase reporter.
https://teams.igem.org/1681	Information Processing	Cellular memory devices are currently limited in their scalability and the ability to efficiently utilize the recording capacity of DNA. In order to record analog information in a way that takes advantage of the storage capacity of DNA while maintaining scalability, we are introducing SCRIBE (Synthetic Cellular Recorders Integrating Biological Events) into the iGEM registry. Developed by Dr. Farzadfard and Dr. Lu at MIT, SCRIBE is a modular device that can be engineered to produce single-stranded DNA in vivo in response to transcriptional signals. Furthermore, a recombinase is coexpressed in order to introduce precise mutations across a population of cells, which accumulate as a function of the magnitude and duration of these signals, thereby creating a long-term and stable system for analog cellular recording. We then demonstrate SCRIBEs potential as a biosensor by characterizing constructs that record environmental pollutants.
https://teams.igem.org/1682	Environment	To ensure healthy growth of crops, farmers must carefully control the levels of macronutrients (nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K)) in their soil. Currently, farmers monitor soil macronutrient levels with chemical assays. We hypothesize that PNK biosensors based on genetic circuits refined through millions of years of evolution will measure the nutrients available to a growing plant more accurately. We are building on the work of previous iGEM teams on soil biosensors and characterizing new parts. We have developed and tested new nitrate-, phosphate-, and potassium-responsive promoters to produce a colorimetric output in a low input environment and added these parts to the registry. We are working on deploying our NPK biosensor in a colorimetric cell-free system and in biofertilizer strains of bacteria. It is our hope that this NPK biosensor technology can be used to optimize the farming and fertilizing process.
https://teams.igem.org/1683	WIKI	Antibiotic resistance is a growing problem facing both patients and physicians worldwide. Phage therapy, the focus of WLC-Milwaukee, is a potential alternative to antibiotics. We sought bacteriophages specific to the gram negative protein tolC, an outer-membrane efflux pore protein. TolC is of interest due to its role in certain antibiotic resistances, as bacteria use it to pump antibiotics out. TolC homologs are found in a variety of gram negative bacteria, including those causing diarrheal diseases. We focused on expressing tolC found in pathogenic bacteria, such as Cholera and Salmonella, in E. coli. The transgenic strains of E. coli were used to search for bacteriophages specific human GI tract pathogens. Once bacteriophages are identified for this tolC receptor, we hope to combine this phage therapy with an antibiotic resisted via efflux. Bacteria which become resistant to the bacteriophage through gene downregulation or function-destroying mutation risk increased sensitivity to the antibiotic action.

https://teams.igem.org/1685	Manufacturing	Surfactant is a compound that lowers surface tension between to liquids (e.g. oil-water) or liquid-solid. One example of naturally occurring surfactant is rhamnolipid. Rhamnolipid has a broad application, starting from enhanced oil recovery, oil spill and pollutant management, to industries such as food, cosmetic, and health care. But unfortunately this biosurfactant is produced by opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Thus, ITB_Indonesia utilises optimised rhlAB gene from Pseudomonas aeruginosa for rhamnolipid production, combined by LacI control and reporter protein for controllable and observable production in E. coli. This rhamnolipid-producing E. coli is named RhamCOLIpid. Produced rhamnolipid is further tested for one of its usages, Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR). EOR using rhamnolipid is expected to serve as a green alternative to increase oil production in Indonesia.
https://teams.igem.org/1686	Environment	European vineyards are threatened by an oomycete called Plasmopara viticola, which infects and drains the resources of grapevine tissues, mainly through leaves and creates irreparable lesions. The most common preventive treatment is called Bouillie Bordelaise and is composed of copper sulfate but has toxic effects on the surrounding soils. Our team proposes to produce an alternative ecological treatment called Curdlan in two host organisms. This &#946;1,3 glucan stimulates the plants immune system therefore protecting it from mildew attacks. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae we plan on overexpressing the Curdlan synthase gene (FKS1) to maximize production, while in Escherichia coli we will be inserting three genes: the Curdlan Synthase gene (crdS), and two genes which assist the transportation of nascent polymers in the cell (crdA and crdC). We then plan on optimizing the production and sulfating the Curdlan molecules since it has been shown that this enhances its protective capacities.

Our genetically engineered E. coli bacteria is able to perform a series of reactions visibly and distinctively in order to represent the plot in different stories. We have chose three particular stories to be the basis of our project: The Ugly Duckling, The Fox and the Grapes, and Houyi Shoots the Sun. All of these stories are well known by people. Our ultimate purpose of our project is to further publicise the idea of bioengineering as well as serve as an educational model for the young to observe and experience.
https://teams.igem.org/1688	Environment	Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are produced by various activities, from grilling meat to coal gasification, and are potent carcinogens. Our project aims to degrade PAHs in industrial waste. The current waste handling method for PAHs is simply to deposit them in landfills where they leak into environment. Our cells need to detect the PAHs for the degradation. But the molecules do not readily pass through the membrane. We solved this predicament by using one of the smaller PAHs as an indicator to degrade the heavier PAHs. The degradation of this small PAH inside the cell relieves repression of genes under the control of the NahR/Psal promoter system. This causes a series of enzymes to get expressed and secreted outside the cell, oxidising and cleaving the ring structures of the carcinogenic compounds, making them available for downstream bio-degradation. To increase the degradation efficiency our system also produces rhamnolipids.
https://teams.igem.org/1689	Health & Medicine	Tuberculosis (TB), caused by <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>, remains one of the world's most serious public health problems. Although tuberculosis is curable and the treatment success rate is high, it is still the second most common cause of death from infectious disease. Most of the deaths occur for lack of effective identification of those in need of therapy. Case detection is currently the rate-limiting step in TB control. A diagnostic tool with high sensitivities and specificities is desired urgently, and it is supposed to be used at the point-of-care within a clinic or in the community. </br>To obviate such problems, Peking iGEM is developing a novel <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> detection system that can transform biomarkers of TB into optical signal or electric signal. Combined with our work in software and hardware development, this new advanced system can be turned out as a powerful tool in TB diagnosis, with high sensitivities and specificities.
https://teams.igem.org/1690	Health & Medicine	The IOD band is a general diagnostic test enabling early detection and mapping of tumor mobility. Over a billion unique tests are made accessible to field experts outside of synthetic biology with a unique clone-free assembly feature. Tumor mobility is incredibly difficult to diagnose due to the rarity of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and the complexity of surface marker combinations. The IOD band strives to make it easy. The central players are processing units called Input Output Diploids or IODs. IODs use antigen recognition and intercellular communication to create a logical network by which even single cells carrying the desired marker profile can be identified in a background of millions. Affirmative CTC localisation triggers a global response manifested by IOD initiated clumping at levels visible to the naked eye. As such, IOD bands do in a test tube what normally requires days to do in the lab.
https://teams.igem.org/1692	Manufacturing	Space exploration lies at the inquisitive core of human nature, yet high costs hinder the advancement of this frontier. We are harnessing the replicative properties of biology to create biOrigamibiological, self-folding origamito reduce the mass, volume, and assembly time of materials needed for space missions. biOrigami consists of two main components: manufacturing substrates biologically and bioengineering folding mechanisms. For substrates, we are developing new BioBricks to synthesize two thermoplastics: polystyrene and polyhydroxyalkanoates. For folding mechanisms, we are using heat-induced contraction of thermoplastics and the contractile properties of bacterial spores. After consulting with experts, we believe that biOrigami could be incorporated into rovers, solar sails, and more. In addition to biOrigami, we are creating a novel method to efficiently transform bacteria by using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, benefitting the broader synthetic biology community. Our project integrates and improves manufacturing processes for space exploration on both the micro and macro levels.

BioDesigner is a design system for Synthetic Biology, with which the user can search and check parts, design device and system, get recommendations and simulations. For additional assistance, BioDesigner provides part and system recommendations, which can be a great assistant for user while designing their own Synthetic system. Recommendations are generated based on existed data and users behavior. User can also get simulation about the gene expression process. Synthetic Biology is a creative, forward thinking work, and BioDesigner is a creative assistant tool.
https://teams.igem.org/1694	Health & Medicine	Targeted therapy is a kind of cancer treatment that uses medicine or other substances to more precisely identify biomarkers and attack cancer cells. Currently, several targeted therapies are simultaneously used to accurately treat cancer patients. Thus in our project, we established a multiple targeting detection platform. We modified <i>Escherichia coli (E. coli)</i> to display single chain fragment variable (scFv) antibodies from targeted drug monoclonal antibodies on the cell membrane to bind with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER 2) antigens. The three separate anti-EGFR, anti-VEGF, and anti-HER2 E. coli systems can be unified to apply a multi-marker concept before, during, and after treatment. This novel detection approach can help medical professionals by generating more accurate diagnoses, which leads to a better prescription for patients.

The symptoms include bloating, stomach cramps, diarrhea and nausea. In this project, we propose to use a synthetic biology approach to achieve 2 major aims: (1) design and construct an Escherichia coli probiotic strain (Lac Breaker) to tackle the lactose intolerance problem which involves high expression of the beta-galactosidase enzyme (driven by expression vector A) and its release from the E. coli cell by autolysis (using a lysis gene cassette on vector B); and (2) evaluate different lysis gene cassette constructs as an effective means to extract high value-added recombinant proteins in biotechnology. This is an improvement of the iGEM project of the 2008 Caltech team (Curing Lactose Intolerance) with greater emphasis on the design, construction and evaluation of various lysis gene cassettes.

We regulate lactate metabolism, the key point of material flux, through lactate sensing system, orthogonal targeted protease degradation, etc. Additionally, we also make riboflavin as the entry point to regulate energy and information relationship. Through reconstruction of the co-cultured MFC, a more efficient and robust system is built up.</p>
https://teams.igem.org/1697	Health & Medicine	Population control is the key to solve the overpopulation problems. One of the factors that limit the application of contraceptive device is the convenience. Contraceptive pill needs to be consumed every day in the same hour, moreover, there are hormonal side effects to the pill such as obesity. Observing these problems, team UI_Indonesia try to create more convenient contraceptive method, we call it; BaContraception, short for Bacterial Contraception. We sought to add spermicidal property to these Lactobacillus sp. Inhabiting the vagina. Thus, the woman inoculated with our engineered Lactobacillus sp. Are always on contraception. We also sought the device to be able to be switched to not producing the spermicidal protein. Thus, we design a toggle switch circuit that can be switched back and forth between producing the contraceptive protein and not by addition of simple sugars such as lactose and xylose.
https://teams.igem.org/1698	Health & Medicine	Our project is a novel bacterial method of DNA detection. We've developed a customisable, linearised, double stranded plasmid with two sticky overhangs. When the sticky overhangs come into contact with a target sequence, the binding of the DNA sequence to the overhangs circularises the plasmid. The circularised plasmid is then transformed into competent E. coli cells. Bacterial growth of green fluorescent colonies indicates a positive result, confirming presence of complementary DNA target sequence. This system could act as a cheap alternative to digital and real time PCR, as target DNA fragments are amplified in living cells without use of a costly PCR machine. This system could potentially be used as a diagnostic or screening tool for viral and/or bacterial infection such as Human Papilloma Virus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis. By improving sensitivity and specificity this system could also be used for detection of genetic mutations resulting in disease such as cystic fibrosis.
https://teams.igem.org/1699	Health & Medicine	Despite recent treatment advancements, cancer is still a major cause of mortality worldwide. One of the fundamental problems preventing the development of effective therapy is the difficulty to target cancer cells exclusively. In Boomerang, we're engineering a genetic device based on a simple concept of AND logic gate: the activation of our CRISPR/Cas9-based system is dependent on the existence of two cancer-specific promoters that control the expression of Cas9 and gRNA, and the combination of these two will occur only in cancer cells. CRISPR/Cas9 system allows several applications of Boomerang: 1) disruption of genes essential for cancer survival; and 2) activation of suicide genes, or color proteins for cancer cell detection (e.g., for complete surgical removal). Our system can be potentially designed according to unique characteristics of a patient's tumor, paving the way to personalized medicine. We hope that our strategy will change the approach to cancer treatments.

Studies have confirmed that miRNA expression is highly concordant cross individuals.Comprehensively considering the performance of each miRNA, we finally chose miR-144 and miR-21 as our biomarkers for esophageal cancer. Our test paper can react to MIR144 and MIR21 present in the saliva whose content are proportional to the cancer.To make our detection quick and convenient, we designed synthetic gene pathways based on paper. It will only require some saliva to complete the detection, which will do no harm to human body. And this techniques can be expanded to be used in the detection of many other diseases which has specific miRNA expression pattern in saliva.

Among numerous heavy metals, such as toxic metals, noble metals and radioactive metals which can be viewed as potential resources, we focus on lead, gold and uranium. Here by using Bacillus subtilis as a bioreactor, we are working to devise a way to absorb and retrieve heavy metals. A Metallosniper targeted at lead, gold and uranium has been successfully engineered. With the feature of producing endospores, we have made it possible for B. subtilis to absorb heavy metals under both benign conditions and adverse circumstances. In a gesture to further improve the efficiency of binding metals, biofilm, cell surface-display system and degradable materials for immobilization are applied in our project. We have also combined all these elements into a unique device for future industrial applications.
https://teams.igem.org/1702	Village	Terpenoids are produced by plants in low concentrations, which can limit commercial usage. Our Escherichia coli has been genetically engineered to produce terpenoids. The strain digests spent frying oil, a carbon source with high-energy molecules that can be broken down via beta oxidation. The rate limiting step of beta-oxidation is Acyl-CoA synthetase (FadD). Increased transcription of FadD will allow our strain to better utilize frying oil waste. Terpenoid production will then be achieved via the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway which is endogenous to E. coli. By increasing flux through the MEP pathway we will increase product yields. Safety considerations have been incorporated into the project through design of cellular level biocontainment. A kill switch, KillerRed, has been improved from previous years. When KillerRed protein is produced the cell turns red. Upon interaction with green light, the cell produces reactive oxygen species which damage the cell, resulting in cell death.

https://teams.igem.org/1704	Village	Peanut allergy is the deadliest food allergy. We aim to help those suffering from peanut allergy by designing a portable and intuitive detector available to anyone. The detection system utilizes a protein complex which recognizes the peanut allergen <i>Arah1</i>. It is composed of our own constructed protein attached to an <i>Arah1</i> specific antibody conjugated to FITC. The constructed protein consists of epitope 2 from <i>Arah1</i> and RFP. <i>Arah1</i> has higher affinity than epitope 2 towards the binding site. Therefore, the constructed protein will be replaced and leave the antibody, if <i>Arah1</i> has contaminated the food sample. We can measure if the constructed protein is attached by using FRET, a mechanism utilized to determine if two different fluorofores are at a close distance, in our case FITC and RFP. The different wavelengths emitted is measured and processed by electrical components. We also have a side project, replacing RFP with a quencer.
https://teams.igem.org/1705	Manufacturing	Relative to commonly used monocultures, microbial co-cultures can better handle consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) - the conversion of substrates to products in a single reactor - by dividing the metabolic load among multiple species. However, problems regarding stability and efficiency must be overcome to implement co-cultures for CBP on an industrial scale. We aim to produce a robust co-culture by ensuring stable, efficient ratios of bacteria using synthetic intercellular communication. Our co-culture converts agricultural waste, lignocellulose, into a useful product, biodiesel. It consists of Cytophaga hutchinsonii, a cellulolytic bacterium, and Escherichia coli, which is engineered to produce biodiesel. We introduce the LuxI/LuxR/AHL quorum sensing system as the communication pathway between the bacteria. To predict bacterial interactions and design the communication network, we model the dynamics of our co-culture using whole-genome scale metabolic models with dynamic flux balance analysis. Our project makes co-cultures more viable for industrial consolidated bioprocessing.
https://teams.igem.org/1706	Environment	Formaldehyde is one of the most dangerous cancerogen which can be easily found in newly decorated houses or new cars. Because there is no simple and convenient way to detect and degrade formaldehyde, we hope to design biobricks to solve this problem by using microorganism. We find that there is a special promoter called hxlR in Bacillus subtilis, which can be induced by formaldehyde and express downstream genes. First, we use special features of pET vectors to express two key enzymes, named formate dehydrogenase (FDH) and formaldehyde dehydrogenase (PADH). Then we add the gene of T7 RNA polymerase in the downstream of promoter hxlR in PSB1C3. Finally, when T7 polymerase is expressed, Vector pET-DUET can express PADH and FDH. In this way, the whole system can be induced by formaldehyde and express PADH and FDH to degrade it.
https://teams.igem.org/1707	Environment	The iGEM competition is the birthplace to many innovative ideas aimed at improving processes in synthetic biology by working with Genetically Engineered Organisms (GEO). However, most projects involve a risk of <b>GEOs dissemination</b> outside the laboratory, which raises environmental issues. To prevent such a risk, we designed a biosafety system that would prevent or at least dramatically limit the chances of accidental GEO spreading. The system consists in both a <b>physical confinement</b> which still allows the GEO to carry out its main function, and a <b>temperature-based containment</b> which ensures the survival of the organism in a restricted temperature range. <i>Escherichia coli</i> was chosen to implement the temperature based system due to its wide use in the iGEM projects. Thus, our system dubbed <b>SafetE.coli</b> could provide the iGEM teams with a "safer" chassis which is less likely to contaminate the environment.

This years iGEM project was to develop a cheaper, non-toxic, alternative to conventional fuel cells; using synthetic biology. Biological photovoltaics (BPV) are a promising candidate to provide an alternative. Our BPV uses the Cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 as the electron source. Using a purpose built fuel cell and Synechocystis, which has been genetically modified to improve interactions between the bacterium and the anode surface, enables the BPV to generate a greater voltage. This BPV will be considered for large scale usage in homes and communities worldwide as a cheap, simple and clean alternative to conventional energy sources.
https://teams.igem.org/1709	New Application	Pattern formation is omnipresent in nature, nevertheless the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Attempting to explain this phenomenon, a genetic circuit that couples cell motility and chemotaxis in <i>Escherichia coli</i> was built. The transmembrane receptor dependent chemotactic signaling pathways in <i>E. coli</i> are well described. But so far, most of the pattern formation research focused on the Tar receptor together with its attractant aspartate. Here however, the attention goes to the function of another chemoreceptor, the Tsr receptor and its corresponding repellent - leucine. This novel approach, in combination with the controlled expression of the motility regulating protein CheZ, enables precise steering of the swimming behavior. All together, this system allows the formation of periodic circles and stripes of high-low cell densities. Based on theoretical analysis, the formation of spatial structures arising from the aggregation process of cells A and intermediate stripes of cells B is expected.
https://teams.igem.org/1710	WIKI	We are investigating the use of several insect cuticle proteins for use as a novel, 3D printable protein matrix to be used in construction and consumer products. Insect exoskeletons have a wide variety of properties and strengths that make them ideal for use in construction, particularly those found in the beetle elytra. Some elytra have been measured to have a greater strength-to-weight ratio than concrete, and at sufficient density make for formidable armor. Our research has shown that by controlling the expression of phenoloxidases, the hardening of the cuticle proteins can be indirectly controlled. This provides us with a mechanism to harden a 3D printed cell suspension into a high-density concrete-like protein matrix.
https://teams.igem.org/1711	New Application	Biosensors for detecting small molecules have many applications in medicine, food, and the environment. Our project aims to combine the emerging fields of synthetic biology and paper diagnostics to create an affordable and accessible platform for a new class of biological sensors that could detect a wide variety of molecules. We first developed a paper microfluidic device housing Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which was then modified to accommodate two different biological detection systems. In one system, the Auxin/IAA-Degron pathway is used in conjunction with beta-galactosidase to produce a visible signal in response to the plant hormone auxin. In the other system, aptazymes, a combination of RNA aptamers and ribozymes, are used to bind theophylline and allow fluorescent protein to be produced. Both pathways serve as models for future real-world applications of our device, including the detection of marine biotoxins in the Pacific Northwest.
https://teams.igem.org/1712	WIKI	We are developing a biosensor for triclosan, an antimicrobial agent whose use has environmental and human health implications. Triclosan inhibits enoyl acp reductase (Fabi). By measuring the rate at which triclosan inhibits Fabi, we can make a standard curve of percent inhibition vs triclosan, and use this standard curve to determine how much triclosan is present in a wastewater sample. We are investigating the activity of the Fabi enzyme from 8 different organisms on a panel of non-native substrates to determine the combination of Fabi and substrate that will yield the best results at the lowest cost. We can then engineer the enzyme to have greater specificity on the non-native substrate through computational design and kunkel mutagenesis. By coupling our biosensor with civic engagement measures, our goal is to raise awareness and accountability around environmental concerns and to empower citizens to participate in decisions being made about chemical use.
https://teams.igem.org/1713	Information Processing	With the ability to create a virtual reality by computer simulation, a mixed-reality era is coming! In this project, we are working on creating a new kind of life form, mixed-reality cells (MR. Cell), which are half-real and half-virtual. To demonstrate our idea, a genetic oscillator was built in E. coli as the real part and an e-oscillator was simulated in a computer as the virtual part. The two parts could interact with each other through an interface device composed of microfluidic chip and chemical/optical modulator. At the beginning, the two oscillators work independently in a dual-reality state. With their interaction, they would gradually adjust to each other without human interference to a strongly coupled and synchronized mixed-reality state. A prototype of MR. Cell was demonstrated in this project which has great potential in a wide range of the future biological research.
https://teams.igem.org/1714	Village	Main immune system of insects, antimicrobial-peptides (AMPs), is known to have very high potentials and work toward wide range of microbes. Thanks to AMPs, insects prosper around the world even without complex acquired immunity like we humans. Good point of AMPs is that it has less chance of getting resistant microbes since they affect on cell membrane. Our project this year is Microbusters. Microbusters are biological device which secretes AMPs. They can be applied to making anti-microbial products or foods. Characteristics of each Microbuster depend on what AMP it secretes, so Microbusters with variety of functions can be designed. We designed two Microbusters. One is <i>Escherichia coli</i> that secrete thanatin, a kind of AMP while it is toxic to its chassis. Second is <i>Lactobacillus casei</i> with &#945;-defensin, which only attacks non-residential flora. Microbusters are going to be a new way to avoid harm from microbes.
https://teams.igem.org/1715	Health & Medicine	Neurodegenerative disorders show decreased levels of NAD+/NAD(H). Using E. coli to colonise the gut, NAD+/NAD(H) levels could be increased by upregulating nadD, nadE and PncB enzymes in the E. coli cytosol; these gene products will be tagged and exported into the periplasm via the tat system to produce NAD+/NAD(H), which will be exported into the gut. The genes and killswitch will be inserted into E. coli, whilst the remaining aspects of the project will be theoretical due to ethical and safety restrictions. Speculatively, increased NAD+/NAD(H) could treat neurodegenerative disorders by mitigating the destruction of neurons and help with muscle fatigue. Regeneration of muscle fibres to restore strength and overall energy levels would be achieved by increased oxidative phosphorylation triggered by NAD+/NAD(H). This treatment provides low-cost NAD+/NAD(H) as part of an autonomous system; increasing the patients quality of life.
https://teams.igem.org/1716	Health & Medicine	Non-ribosomal peptides have important anti-bacterial, anti-cancer, and immunosuppressive biological activities. They are synthesized by modular, high molecular weight enzymes that assemble more than 500 different amino acid substrates in an assembly line manner. For this reason, synthetic biologists have tried to engineer these proteins and to switch modules to create analogs and novel natural products, but with little success. Despite being modular, the interactions between modules have evolved to be highly specific, making synthetic Non-Ribosomal Peptide Synthases (NRPS) a challenge to engineer. Instead of switching modules we introduced a recombination system targeting oligo integration in Bacillus subtilis. We used the recombineering system to alter the active sites determining substrate specificity, thereby creating variants of antibiotics. Our focus was the tyrocidine antibiotic, which cannot be used intravenously due to its toxicity. Our goal is to create new analogs through multiplex automated genome engineering to reduce toxicity.
https://teams.igem.org/1717	North America	Optimizing keratinase expression provides a great opportunity to impact the management of the estimated 8.5 billion tons of poultry feather from farms globally as well as the tons of human hair clogging up waste water treatment facilities worldwide. Also, bio-degraded keratin from chicken feathers has been shown to be useful for commodity products such as fertilizers and livestock feeds. Our team is developing two keratinase-producing E. coli bacteria using the KERA and KERUS genetic sequences found naturally in the Bacillus genera. The KERA and KERUS sequences will be optimized for expression in E. coli, synthesized into plasmid rings, and ligated into a standard biobrick backbone for submission to the iGem parts registry. An IPTG-inducible promotor (part BBa_J04500) from the standard registry of parts will then be added to each KER gene to express this protein.
https://teams.igem.org/1718	Environment	Fracking is a common method for extracting natural gas and other fossil fuels from the ground, but it requires the use of many hazardous and carcinogenic compounds. In Colorado, ground water contamination from fracking has endangered many communities safe drinking water. To address this environmental health issue, we developed a biosensor to detect naphthalene, a common reagent in fracking. Naphthalene detection and output signal amplification can be achieved using the Lux promoter and the Bxb1 integrase. Our biosensor uses a naphthalene induced promoter located upstream of the BxB1 integrase. Once expressed, Bxb1 acts on a logic gate to express RFP. A Lux cell-cell signaling system from V. fischeri will enable our system to be more sensitive at low concentrations. Our biosensor could be housed within a stake-shaped device, containing a pump to obtain ground water and a live culture box kept at homeostatic conditions.
https://teams.igem.org/1719	Foundational Advance	L-tert-leucine is important in developing chiral pharmaceutically active chemicals. Many methods have been used in L-tert-leucine synthesis, but products are usually racemic. Scientists developed enzymatic reductive amination to product L-tert-leucine by using leucine dehydrogenase and formate dehydrogenase. Initially, they used isolated enzymes, which can be disadvantageous for that enzymes are always destabilized in the isolation and purification process. What's more, the cofactor-NADH is rather an expensive raw material, which will enhance the cost. So scientists introduced whole-cell bio-catalysts to L-tert-leucine production. Whole-cell biocatalysts could stabilize enzymes and reduce the addition level of co-factor NADH. However, the NADH consumption rate does not equal to its regeneration. The criminal is different strength of enzymes, we regulate the efficiency of RBS to control its strength. With mathematical modeling, we will get the most suitable efficiency of RBS of leucine dehydrogenase to decrease additional NADH.
https://teams.igem.org/1720	Health & Medicine	Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death in many developed countries. Cyclic  guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) is a critical second messenger molecule involved in myocardial diseases such as  hypertrophy.This summer, we try to use synthetic biology to modify the cGMP metabolic pathway in a human cell line. We hope that our work would provide the proof of principle for future gene therapy. cGMP can transduce nitric oxide and natriuretic peptide coupled signaling and remit the myocardial hypertrophy by relaxing the blood vessels. We up-regulate the soluble guanylate cyclase(sGC), an enzyme that synthesize cGMP from GTP&#65292;by overexpressing the &#945; and &#946; subunits of sGC in a mammalian cell line. However, elevated level of cGMP leads to the feed-back expression of PDE5A, a cGMP-specific phosphodiesteras that degrades cGMP. Thus, we further modify the pathway by knocking down the PDE5A gene. To achieve controllable up-regulation of cGMP level in the cell, we also propose a hypoxia-inducible operon,HRE,as a switch to up regulate cGMP only in hypoxia situation.
https://teams.igem.org/1721	Village	Lyme disease is carried by the Lyme bacteria. The ability of Lyme to adapt to its different hosts environments has made this disease difficult to treat and detect. Our project, uses this ability to specifically target Lyme when it is found in Ticks. Our construct expresses three proteins: OspA, which binds to the tick's TROSPA in the gut and prevents Lyme infection, Wolbachia Surface Protein, which allows for vertical transmission of the Live Vaccine bacteria and it also tempers the insects immune system, and GFP, which is used as an indicator protein. The construct is transfected in DH5Alpha E. Coli and it is tested in Drosophila (to check for vertical transmission) before being inserted into ticks. Since Lyme disease is not the only vector-born disease originated in insects, this Live Vaccine can be used for other diseases such as West Nile Virus, Dengue, Malaria, Yellow Fever etc .
https://teams.igem.org/1722	Health & Medicine	Nowadays,bladder cancer is one of the most urologic tumours in the world.However,theconventional therapy of cancer such as  chemotherapy and radiation,have focused on mass cellkilling  without specific targeting and often cause side effects and frequent failures. Here we present the Synthesizing AND GATE genetic circuit based on UAA (Unnatural Amino  Acid) and Orthogonal system  that will detect and induce  the apoptosis of bladder cancer cell. The system encompasses two parts.One is the synthesizing gene circuit which only operates  in bladder cancer cells that behaves  as a logical AND gate on two input promoters.Another part is to insert the synthesized unnatural amino  acids in the bladder cancer cell to continue the protein translation at TAG(amber mutation) in order to activate the effectors. This methodology is based on the orthogonal system which enable the unnatural amino acids  to generate protein without affecting  other parts work. As a result, the output gene will hinder the tumour growth and induce  apoptosis.
https://teams.igem.org/1723	Information Processing	Engineering transcriptional logic gates to program cellular behavior remains an important challenge for synthetic biology. Currently, genetic circuits reproducing digital logic are limited in scalability and robustness by output discrepancies and crosstalk between transcriptional pathways. We propose to address these issues using RNA-guided dCas9 fused to a transcription activation domain as a programmable transcription factor. Fusion dCas9 targeted upstream of the transcription starting site (TSS) recruits RNA polymerase. Yet, dCas9 may also sterically hinder transcription initiation if bound too close to the TSS. The guide RNA acts as a biological wire: it determines dCas9s binding site and enables specific regulation of homogenous synthetic promoters. Exploiting these properties we aim to build biocompatible transistor-like elements whose assembly may allow for the creation of chainable and parallelizable bio-logic gates. Ultimately, we hope to create a toolkit facilitating the design and implementation of bio-logic circuits thereby enabling more complex decision-making in cells.

This year our team attemps to design a novel and effective device in order to remediate global cadmium ion pollution. To solve this problem, we combine the curli nanofibers CsgA protein on the surface of E.coli with synthetic phytochelatins (ECs), which are analogs of phytochelatins (PCs). ECs are able to chelate with cadmium ion. Our engineered bacteria can also identify different concentrations of cadmium ion turning blue for low concentration and red for high concentration.
https://teams.igem.org/1725	New Application	Our project is centered on using bioluminescence as a light source in <i>Escherichia coli</i>. After brainstorming with a designer, we decided to make toy nightlights for children. We believe this would be a good way to get the public talking about synthetic biology, and to ignite a passionate interest for science and synthetic biology in children. To make the nightlight more interactive, we decided that the children should care for the monster-styled toy during the day, so it will glow at night, protecting them from any bedtime monsters. To turn off the <i>Aliivibrio fischeri</i> bioluminescence <i>lux</i> operon during the day, we are using a UVA light sensor system from <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC6803, and an inverter based on TetR family repressors from <i>Pseudomonas</i>. We are refactoring the <i>lux</i> operon for optimal performance using BioBrick assembly and a ribosome binding site library for each gene in the operon.

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have an extensive ability to disinfect and facilitate wound healing. We selected two types of AMPs: Epinecidin-1(Epinephelus coioides) and Signiferin (Crinia signifera) are constructed into a potential material of wound dressing. We use E.coli as host to express these peptides. We attach a signal peptide to facilitate secretion. After purifying, we will test the functions of these two AMPs for their abilities to disinfection and in vitro wound healing. We will carry out in vivo experiments in mice test if these two AMPs work in healing wound in animal.
https://teams.igem.org/1728	WIKI	Oral cancer is a common cancer worldwide. One of the major problems of oral cancer is that early malignancy could only be detected by clinical oral examination from health care professionals, and there are no clinical tests at the molecular level. Recently, there are several Proteins and mRNAs reported as promising potential non-invasive biomarkers in saliva for oral cancer. Our team wants to establish simple, objective and quantifiable non-invasive detection system for those biomarkers. Our system includes two aims : Major : engineered yeasts that express a reporter activated by IL-8, which is one of the most statistically significant protein biomarkers in oral cancer saliva samples. Minor : synthetic toehold switch gene regulators as RNA sensors to detect specific mRNA biomarkers. These efforts will provide the groundwork for new molecular diagnoses in oral cancer.
https://teams.igem.org/1729	Manufacturing	The yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> is used industrially to produce valuable products via fermentation. Many of these products are produced under anaerobic conditions, when the electron transport chain in mitochondria lacks the terminal electron acceptor and oxidative phosphorylation ceases. The goal of our project is to control aerobic respiration by manipulating the expression of mitochondrial ribosomal protein S12. This protein, which is encoded by the nuclear MRPS12 gene, is essential for the function of mitochondrial ribosomes and the synthesis of key components of the electron transport chain. We propose that the production of secondary metabolites in yeast could be optimized by purposefully regulating aerobic respiration during industrial fermentations.

A sustainable initiative is to produce biodegradable plastics; however its synthesis process (chemical and biological) is complex and expensive. The team UChile-OpenBio is designing two populations of <i>Escherichia coli</i> to produce a biodegradable plastic called PLA (Polylactic acid) from easy to assimilate renewable resources. The first population will convert glucose into lactate and will self-regulate its production by sensing the pH. The second population will polymerize lactate into PLA and will export it into the medium. In addition the team is planning to replace the glucose by Chilean brown macroalgae (kelp), a renewable resource to sustainably produce PLA. In this way, the team would help fighting against pollution, contributing to a better world! </center>
https://teams.igem.org/1731	Health & Medicine	Every 7 seconds one person dies from diabetes (IDF, 2014). Among others, Type 1 Diabetes is the result of a partial or complete lack of insulin production that leads to deregulation of glucose levels in blood. Current available solutions for this disorder are based on complicated and expensive devices of external use. We propose the use of an innovative system based on the construction of a bacterial sensor capable to respond to glucose concentrations; secondly this sensor aims to induce the production of insulin according to glucose levels. The bacteria are going to be contained in a modular device composed by contention, communication, extraction and change sections. For the design of the device, a bio-compatible material was searched. This device is designed specifically to prevent an immune response of the patient. The system designed combines mechanical engineering and biotechnology, ensuring an appropriate and secure insulin dosage for the patient.

To enable the design and fabrication of DIY biosensors we are creating schematics, a parts list and detailed instructions on how to build a low cost luminometer and fluorimeter. The precision, accuracy, and sensitivity of the instrument will be demonstrated using a set of luciferase and fluorescent protein reporters. An estrogen biosensor was constructed that responds to 17-&#946;-estradiol at concentrations ranging from 1nM to 100uM. The system was then modeled in BioNetGen to inform lab experiments. The luminometer is a simple photodiode detector with the signal being integrated using an Arduino and output data being processed with open source software. The fluorimeter is an extension that includes an LED light source and emission/excitation filters appropriate for the fluorescent protein to be analyzed. The entire device is encased in a 3D printed shell.
https://teams.igem.org/1733	Foundational Advance	The field of synthetic biology seeks to engineer desirable cellular functionalities by developing molecular technologies that enable precise genetic manipulation. A promising solution is to reliably control proteins that naturally execute genetic modifications. Current strategies to regulate activity of such proteins primarily rely on modulating protein expression level through transcriptional control; however, these methods are susceptible to slow response and leaky expression. In contrast, strategies that exploit post-translational regulation of activity, such as conditional dimerization of split protein halves, have been demonstrated to bypass these limitations. Here, we compare the relative efficiency of previously characterized dimerization domains in regulating activities of three important genetic manipulation proteins - integrases and recombination directionality factors for genetic logic applications, and saCas9 for in vivo genome editing applications. We also establish guidelines to rationally identify promising protein split sites. Our characterization of these systems in mammalian cells ultimately paves way for important biomedical applications.

We will use the Sf9 cells as an alternative for the production of proteins with high complexity and post-traductional modifications, because of their flexibility, cultivation time and minor cost compared with other expression systems. We will characterize functional parts for two main areas: Transfection and Genome Editing. For the first part we will characterize baculovirus mediated transfection and , direct plasmid transfection for the generation of stable cell lines; for the second part we will use the CRISPR/Cas9 system to assay highly specific genome modifications in an effort to improve production and ease of use of this technology.

https://teams.igem.org/1736	Village	The enzyme ethene monooxygenase (EtnABCD) catalyses the epoxide reaction that converts ethylene to ethylene oxide by incorporating a hydroxyl group. EtnABCD is of great interest for biocatalytic epoxide production to replace current organic chemistry methods which present safety and environmental concerns. Mycobacterium smegmatis is the only organism that endogenously expresses ethene monooxygenase, yet is a poor cloning host. To enhance the heterologous expression of the EtnABCD enzyme, a mathematical model was developed taking into account the differences in codon frequencies between organisms. The M. smegmatis gene encoding EtnABCD was modified using this model in order to obtain optimized sequences for expression in both Pseudomonas putida, as an intermediate host, and Escherichia coli. The altered EtnABCD sequences will be cloned into appropriate vector inserts. Once stable expression of EtnABCD is established in Pseudomonas putida, the E. coli optimized sequence will be expressed to give a high activity monooxygenase enzyme.
https://teams.igem.org/1737	Environment	North American bats are suffering from an emerging fungal disease called White Nose Syndrome. During the crucial winter months, the fungus wakes bats from hibernation. Affected hibernacula often face mortality rates in excess of 80%, an unsustainable loss in animals which only have one offspring per year. As it spreads, the disease impacts many bat species with roles in pest control and pollination. Anti-fungal agents are typically indiscriminate, affecting native species which may be beneficial to the bat, while creating a strong selective pressure for future resistance. We have instead decided to develop a system using compounds which slow and inhibit the fungus, giving bats a better fighting chance. We are modifying E. coli to produce ocimene, a terpene compound in orange fragrance, which has been shown to have inhibitory effects against fungi. We plan to explore enzyme inhibitors and fungal sensing for next year's competition.

https://teams.igem.org/1739	WIKI	Our project aims to produce self-assembling conductive nano-wires using a functional amyloid system synthesised by E.coli. We use the export machinery of the endogenous curli amyloid system of E.coli, normally responsible for biofilm formation, to produce functional extracellular amyloid nano-fibrils composed of the amyloid-forming domain of the yeast prion protein Sup35. Our engineered BioBrick plasmid will contain the amyloid-forming domain of Sup35, Sup35NM, linked to the curli signal sequence for extracellular amyloid protein export, and also to cytochrome b562 to allow for electron transport. Once exported, the Sup35NM monomers will polymerise to form the amyloid fibrils decorated with cytochrome b562. Exogenous addition of haem will allow cytochrome b562 on Sup35NM fibrils to fold into its active conformation, allowing electron transport along the length of the amyloid fibres. Our project has the potential to provide a source of both renewable nano-material and energy.
https://teams.igem.org/1740	Foundational Advance	Controlling protein activity by light is important for analyzing protein function and controlling synthetic biology system.However, previous methods require co factor or use toxic blue light. Fluorescent proteins such as a Green Fluorescent Protein are widely used as optical sensor. We forcused on Dronpa in them. Dronpa is a green fluorescent protein which is cloning from Echinophyllia sp.This is a photswitcable fluorescent protein, it can reversibly change On state and Off state. We used mutant of Dronpa, Dronpa145N. Dronpa 145N switches on under 400nm light and forms a tetramer, and switches off under 500nm light and forms monomer. Fuse target protein with Dronpa 145N. Dronpa 145N domain reversibly change monomer and tetramer by light, the target protein between Dronpa 145N domain can change active conformation and inactive conformation. In this way, we can control protein activity by light. This method does not require co factor and use blue toxic light.

Producing recombinant proteins of high purity and free of toxic compounds is a hallmark. For this purpose we generated a series of constructs with tagged superfolder GFP proteins expressed under the control of promoters for non-toxic sugar inducers: arabinose, melibiose, rhamnose and xylose. We have focused on promoters, because these minimal, independent regulators of expression levels are important tools for synthetic biology to build complex but still compact genetic systems. This experiment was conducted using CPEC cloning method (circular polymerase extension cloning) which is suitable for assembling small contructs from five DNA fragments at the same time. Moreover, we wanted to improve chromatography system by generating rapidly releasing fluorescent proteins produced from our designed vectors in Escherichia coli.

https://teams.igem.org/1743	Health & Medicine	The copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction has been widely used in the laboratory for tagging or labeling biological molecules, but it cannot be directly applied in living organisms because of the toxicity associated with excess or free copper ions. No enzyme exists to catalyze the CuAAC reaction, but its development would perfectly complement the growing ability of scientists to introduce azide- and alkyne-labeled molecules into biological systems. Our goal is to discover a protein to bind Cu ions safely <i>in vivo</i> and perform the CuAAC reaction. We will attempt this by generating a large library of Cu-binding proteins, developing a reliable phage display system to screen for the desired CuAAC activity, and evolving any active enzymes for improved function.

However, this is not really the case for synthetic biology lab. Almost every manipulations are man-made. These manipulations are often really long, repetitive and require precision and dexterity. That would be great tasks to assign to a robot since they can easily meet all the requirements. This is exactly what Biobot project is all about: design and build a robotic platform to automate biology lab protocols. Manipulations included in the protocols and supported by our platform are pipetting, magnetisation, temperature control, turbidity measurement, and centrifuging.

We are addressing this problem by transplanting the circadian rhythm-generating KaiABC system from cyanobacteria into E. coli and optimizing its function by controlling protein stoichiometry and adding accessory proteins. Such a BioBrick would be important for any application in which gene expression needs to be regulated on a 24-hour schedule. For example, it is often important to release a drug at a specific time of the day. As a proof-of-concept application, we implemented this clock as a potential solution to jet lag and sleep disorders by engineering a strain of E. coli that facilitates the production of a melatonin precursor in the gut on a 24-hour cycle. Thus, our project demonstrates the application of a robust KaiABC-based clock in timed drug dosage, as well as introduces an oscillator BioBrick into the synthetic biology community.

https://teams.igem.org/1747	Energy	Free fatty acids are biofuel precursors. We focused on using zeaxanthin to counter the toxic effects of increased free fatty acids in an altered Synechococcus elongatus 7942 strain. Zeaxanthin acts as an antioxidant, stabilizes the membrane, and is needed for electron transport chain function. To increase the concentration of zeaxanthin and its precursors, we introduced a circuit containing parts of the zeaxanthin synthesis pathway. The La Cañada subset of our team focused on tocopherol, a metabolite that has similar properties to zeaxanthin in cyanobacteria. Tocopherol acts as an antioxidant, protects the cell from lipid peroxidation, and enhances photosynthesis. A circuit was made with the gene p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase to catalyze the formation of homogenistic acid, the rate limiting step of tocopherol synthesis. In an attempt to further increase the production of fatty acids, both zeaxanthin and tocopherol circuits are dynamically regulated, utilizing a fatty acid-sensitive promoter-repressor system, pLR and FadR.
https://teams.igem.org/1748	Energy	Energy is the single most important problem facing humanity today as quoted by Richard Smalley, late Nobel laureate, in 2002. Hence, the reason for exploring the use of synthetic biology for modifying Escherichia coli for microbial fuel cells. Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 is a dissmilatory metal reducing bacterium. One of the several electron transport chains found in Shewanella oneidensis is the Mtr pathway. This specific pathway is involved in the accepting of electrons which then carries a potential electrical charge. By cloning this pathway into E.coli, the aim is to produce an efficient electric producing microbial fuel cell (MFC). The efficiency of the MFC is down to the biofilm which is formed when cells adhere to a surface and stick to each other. Shewanella oneidensis is capable of transferring electrons through extensions known as nanowires. We have explored electron transfer through the use of flagella found in E.coli K-12 derivative, DH5-&#945;.

The Australian National University iGEM team explored the principles of optogenetics, an emerging field in which gene expression can be precisely controlled by light. We developed an application for the CRY2 and CIB1 light-inducible expression system to synthesise NAD in Escherichia coli. NAD is a commercially valuable metabolite, however in large quantities NAD is toxic to E. coli. Our light-inducible expression system enables the accumulation of the NAD precursor, &#945;-iminosuccinic acid in darkness. Blue-light induction of an irreversible, blue-light activated switch with a split, modular CRY2/CIB1-Cre-recombinase construct enables production of a late-stage biosynthetic enzyme, allowing the rapid production of the toxic metabolite from the accumulated precursor. We have further developed a customisable blue-light source for the activation of our construct under different light conditions.
https://teams.igem.org/1751	Food & Nutrition	Acyl Phenylethanoid Glycosides&#65288;APeGs&#65289;plays a very important role in various plants that can bring benefits to human beings through their physiological activity. However, in natural plants, APeGs' low production and great difference have led to great disparity of food quality, making it hard to be effectively used. In order to control and ensure the quality of products more effectively, we have used biotechnology to look into physiological metabolic pathways of APeGs, and influences on the products exerted by the regulation and control of different key enzymes. Thus plants whcih contain more stable APeGs can be gained to benifit human beings in a better way.
https://teams.igem.org/1753	Health & Medicine	Tumor cells are found to have increased ability to consume glucose due to their high growth rate, thus causing the surrounding glucose concentration to drop. Therefore, it is possible to discriminate tumor cells from other tissue cells by detecting the low glucose concentration. Using liposome as a vector, we hope to design a drug expression system with the ability to respond to different glucose level. To achieve this, we combine the CRP activator, a regulatory protein activated by cAMP, with red fluorescent protein (RPF) as a reporter of expression level. Since glucose concentration is reversely related with cAMP level, a change of glucose level can influence the binding of CRP with target operon, thus altering the fluorescent intensity. By expressing our desinged gene circuit with <i>in vitro</i> protein expression system, we then test the expression level of the gene and find out how it relates with glucose concentration.
https://teams.igem.org/1754	Software	Our teams goal is to make a handy tool for synthetic biologists. We made a program named Gil which helps you with finding and constructing bio-chemical pathways. Given only reactants and final products, you can get several possible pathways using our program. It has significant feature of biological scoring system that based on meaningful compounds in energy such as ATP, number of carbon, and NADP. This scoring system can guide you like navigation to find the most efficient pathway or to build a plausible de novo pathway. Our program also provides gene sequence information of the pathways so it will be more easy to synthesize your pathway. Using this program, we designed a wetlab experiment, making an agar utilizing EFC. We found a pathway that starts from agarose to galactose, producing NADH during its process. This NADH is then oxidized by diaphorase and produces electricity.
https://teams.igem.org/1755	Measurement	As the global industrialization has been developed, heavy metal ions became assignable factors of water pollution, which may cause serious damage to human health. However, the measurements for the concentration of heavy metals are complex and expensive. In our project, we have applied several transcription factors which are sensitive to the concentration of copper ions and chromium ions to regulate the expression of protein ribB. The existence of ribB will enhance the production of riboflavin. Moreover, riboflavin, as the electron carrier, could improve the electricity producing performance of the Microbial Fuel Cells (MFCs). So in this way, we successfully correlated the concentration of heavy metal ions together with the output voltage of the MFC. Whats more, we further created a convenient deviceMicro Holmes (a combination of MFC and electronic components), to monitor heavy metal ions of water sample any place any time.
https://teams.igem.org/1756	Art & Design	This Bacterial Music Generator translates the color and positions of bacteria colonies on a plate into sound composition. Integrating the unpredictable nature of life with digital technology, we aim to introduce new forms of bio-data into the sound domain. We engineered E. coli expressing chromoproteins, fluorescent proteins, or luciferase to produce colors visible under white light. Processing converts an image of the bacterial plate into binary data and grid-form. Using the grid as a step sequencer, we can generate patterned sounds.
https://teams.igem.org/1757	New Application	Immobilized enzyme technology is a far more efficient process which allows enzymes to be held in place throughout the reaction, therefore,they are easily separated from the products and is widely used in industry for enzyme catalysed reactions. Cellulosome are muti-enzyme complex present by a variety of cellulases, hemicellulases relying on the specific interaction of cohesion-dockerin. Based on the cellulosome structure, we propose a method: cellulose as immobilization substrate, CBM(cellulose-binding module)as fixed labels, using three pairs of specific cohesion-dockerins to build scaffolding protein structure in order to improve the amount of enzyme immobilization, increase the catalytic efficiency of the immobilized enzyme and reduce the cost of purification enzyme. The project is not only a new attempt of immobilized enzyme technology, but also for building multi-immobilized enzyme complex to explore new avenues.
https://teams.igem.org/1758	Environment	We developed cell-free biosensors which can be used as paper-based test strips. These offer significant advantages over conventional biosensors regarding biosafety, sensitivity and output signal. We created two technical approaches built upon self-made E.coli cell extract and our newly established Plasmid Repressor Interaction Assay (PRIA). Both can be immobilized on paper. The fluorescence signal is detected via smartphone. With these novel biosensor designs we tackle the problem of date rape drug intoxications, which is of increasing relevance in our area, by detecting a common ingredient. Another major problem is the contamination of water with heavy metals. Heavy metal sensors designed by previous iGEM teams as well as new biosensors are combined to a modular cell-free test strip for simultaneous detection. All in all, we are providing an extensible biosensor on paper as a valuable tool for water quality analysis for everyone.
https://teams.igem.org/1759	Software	Many existing biobricks are not well documented, which make it challenging to use them. Here we present a web-based tool BASE (Biobrick Auxiliary Selection Explorer) to search, evaluate and visualize biobricks at part, devise and system levels. At part-level, similar to our work last year, biobrick parts are scored according to their current status, user comments and reviews, times of citation and etc. At device level, features, such as the order of parts and the co-existence frequency of two parts in a device, are added into the scoring system. At system-level, the regulation relationship between devices is added to the scoring system. At each level, the biobricks can be searched, evaluated and ranked according to their scores. A visualization function is also provided. In addition, the score can also be calculated according to a user-defined configuration, and an automatic adjusting system is also provided to incorporate users' selection preference.
https://teams.igem.org/1760	WIKI	The concentration of toxic chemical by-products from oil sands exploitations has been increasing since 2012. Recent efforts to address environmental pollution converge towards bioremediation as the most promising solution. While endogenous bacteria such as Pseudomonas Putida F1 can degrade toluene, we optimized E. coli to be more efficient at breaking down 3-methylcatechol, a rate-limiting step in the toluene degradation pathway. We did so by creating 2 plasmids that once co-transformed into E. coli would achieve the metabolization of toluene down to water and carbon dioxide. Additionally, a web application for visualizing, manipulating, and comparing genome-scale metabolic models of bacterial consortia was developed and used to analyse the introduction of our synthetic E. coli into the Athabasca river microbiome. We have created a framework to analyze the optimal solution to the problem present, by considering designs, associated cost profiles, and political risks in the context of Albertas soil sand industry.
https://teams.igem.org/1761	New Application	Accurate and early diagnosis of diseases is at the forefront of the medical sciences. Although many biosensors have already become available, a universal biosensor platform is lacking. As a first step towards such a platform, we are introducing a transmembrane biosensor which may in the future be incorporated into signaling pathways. The system is characterized by three modules, aptamers as recognition elements, outer-membrane proteins as the scaffold and signaling components which can translate ligand binding into a measurable signal through heterodimerization. Aptamers can be clicked onto the outer membrane proteins post-translationally using SPAAC click-chemistry, making the system inherently modular. The biosensors can be employed in a wide range of applications: from detecting biomarkers to the overuse of pesticides. We believe that in the future, the system can go beyond its function as a biosensor and may be able to trigger cellular responses.

https://teams.igem.org/1763	Manufacturing	Among natural materials, silk fibers boast unparalleled strength and elasticity. This has made silk ideal for use in apparel, medical sutures, and other high-performance materials. The unique profile of silk arises from the composition of its repetitive protein domains, which varies between species. We aimed to program the physical properties of synthetic silk in two ways: by modularizing spider silk genes and tuning their properties through directed assembly, and by fusing accessory proteins to silkworm and honeybee silks to expand their functionality. To overcome the challenge of creating large, repetitive, GC-rich genes, we adapted Iterative Capped Assembly to ligate spider silk genes in specific ratios, orders, and lengths. The recombinant silks were expressed in <i>E. coli</i> then spun via standard wet spinning. This provides a platform for standardizing the customization of synthetic silk fibers, and exploring their potential as multipurpose biomaterials.

https://teams.igem.org/1765	Environment	"ExTermite coli is a novel system to exterminate termites, which combines an engineered Escherichia coli and a unique pseudo-egg delivery system. The E. coli was engineered to overexpress glucose-3-dehydrogenase (G3DH), which converts trehalose into the trehalase inhibitor 3,3-diketo-trehalose (3,3dkt). Because trehalose is a major termite blood sugar and trehalase is essential for trehalose metabolism, G3DH essentially converts trehalose into an insecticide. The pseudo-egg delivery system takes advantage of a habit termites have of carrying their eggs to their nests and licking them. Termites recognize their eggs by sensing &#946;-glucosidase and lysozyme, which act as egg-recognition pheromones. The pseudo eggs, containing both termite egg-recognition molecules and engineered E. coli, will be delivered to their nests and then licked by the termites present, thus allowing the G3DH produced by the E. coli to convert trehalose into insecticide inside the termite bodies. Consequently ExTermite coli can effectively exterminate termites in their nest.
https://teams.igem.org/1766	Health & Medicine	Early disease diagnosis still represents one of the most crucial issues in modern medicine. Despite great advances in high-throughput technologies and the discovery of several hundred new disease biomarkers, we are currently still unable to detect diseases specifically and sensitively when they are most vulnerable, at the beginning. We want to develop a transferable, biological detection system for different diseases using HER-2, a breast cancer biomarker, for a proof-of-prinicple. Therefore, we created a novel class of chimeric receptors based on the bacterial osmoregulator EnvZ. We substituted a part of the periplasmic domain of EnvZ with an exchangable, but highly-specific protein binder, an Affibody molecule. Upon antigen binding, the receptor would trigger the OmpR signaling cascade leading to the production of quorom sensing molecules which activate transcription of a fluorescent signal in a separated read-out strain. Taken together, this system could be a transferable method for biomarker detection.
https://teams.igem.org/1767	Village	Genetically modified organisms, once released into nature, influence the natural diversity of the environment and raise concerns among the public. To reduce this risk, we strive to develop a time-controlled kill switch. By introducing a genetic circuit into <i>E.coli</i> we aim to tightly regulate the bacteria's lifetime according to initial conditions set by the user. We base the parameters for the biological characterization on a mathematical model that covers various aspects of our system, including plasmid loss. Furthermore, we develop a tool for simulation of biological circuits hence helping synthetic biologists worldwide setting up experiments. Given the large number of iGEM projects, we additionally develop a search engine for previous iGEM projects. By providing not only a time-controlled kill switch that deals with fears of the public, but also contributing helpful tools to the iGEM community, we are convinced that future scientists, such as ourselves, will benefit from our project.
https://teams.igem.org/1768	New Application	Transcriptional switches form an integral part of synthetic biology. In the absence of positive feedback loops these systems are unstable since they require the maintained presence of a regulator. DNA switches based on heritable genetic modifications can allow for a permanent change in gene expression even in the absence of the initial signal. The Cre-Lox recombinase system from the P1 bacteriophage has been successfully used in genetic manipulation to excise targeted DNA fragments. Our aim is to use the Cre-Lox recombinase system to trigger a heritable genetic switch that allows for irreversible ON/OFF programming as an alternative to positive feedback loops. We are testing different approaches relying on the inversion and excision of lox-flanked DNA parts. Our long term goal is to integrate this system with signals from quorum sensing and a logic gate to program conditional chemotaxis in motile E. coli.
https://teams.igem.org/1769	Environment	Phytophthora infestans is the causal agent of late blight disease of several members from the Solanaceae family. Potato, the third most important food crop in the world and a source of major agricultural income in many countries, easily falls victim to P. infestans. Yet most existing approaches are ineffective and have certain drawbacks. This year, the NYMU-Taipei iGEM team creates a systematic disease control method that can prevent, detect, and cure potato late blight. Inspired by competitive inhibition in pharmacology, we designed a ligand with higher affinity to block the entrance of P. infestans effector proteins. To detect infection in the plant, we devised a soil-based microbial fuel cell (SMFC) detecting salicylic acid emission and producing oscillating current. We also characterized a new defensin to inhibit nutrient absorption and further growth of the oomycete. Our goal is to provide an easily-practiced standard procedure for anyone involved in the production line.

https://teams.igem.org/1772	Energy	The production of some biofuels is inhibited by lignin, a complex organic polymer which physically blocks carbohydrate substrates and inhibits biomass degrading enzymes (BDEs). A common biofuel practice is to sequester lignin using energy-intensive thermal pretreatment. The recent development of a synthetic yeast that spatially separates lignin degradation products from vulnerable BDEs enables an efficient lignin breakdown system to reduce the energy input for biofuel production. By expressing enzymes from lignin-degrading species (termites and white rot fungi), we aim to establish a novel enzymatic pretreatment system in a yeast chassis. Six enzymes were selected for their ability to operate at room temperature and standard pH. The expressed enzymes were evaluated individually and in combination for lignin-degradation efficiency. Furthermore, we designed an additional vector to contain our genetically modified yeast using an oxygen-repressed killswitch.
https://teams.igem.org/1773	Foundational Advance	We are Vilnius iGEM - the first team from Lithuania and the Baltic States. Our goal is to tackle one of the biggest problems of Synthetic Biology  the regulation of the spread of GMOs in the environment. The aim of the ColiClock project consists of creating a bacterium with an integrated count-down timer triggering a self-destruction mechanism. The idea would apply to cells that need to have a limited lifetime outside of a laboratory environment. The mechanism is achieved using the type I-F CRISPR-Cas system, controlled by LuxR and cI, that is navigated to important genes in the genomic DNA. In addition, we aim to present and discuss this globally relevant topic with Lithuanian industries, policy makers and the general public.
https://teams.igem.org/1774	Village	While the future of synthetic biology hinges upon overcoming biosafety concerns, the accidental escape of synthetic organisms due to unpredictable behaviours can pose a major threat to our environment. Hence, a tightly regulated switch is needed to induce suicide by the leaked organisms, ultimately leading to destruction of undesired genetic material. In our project we design and engineer two biological circuits based on the versatile CRISPR Cas systems as replaceable killing switches. To minimize basal expression, arabinose and tryptophan help repress the expression of Cas associated proteins, gRNA and crRNA. In order to achieve biosafety, destruction of essential genes will be activated when the synthetic organisms leave their specified working environment. We sought to investigate the regulation of the circuits and compare the killing efficiency of the two Cas systems using E. Coli BL21 DE3 as the chassis.

https://teams.igem.org/1776	Health & Medicine	UFMG_Brazil iGEM team project aims to create a new system of drug production and delivery based on an attenuated strain of the protozoan Leishmania donovani. This protozoan may be a good new chassis, because of its ability to infect macrophages efficiently and expresses proteins with proper post-translational modifications, delivering these proteins inside macrophages. INF-&#946; is used to treat autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, as well as inflammatory joint diseases, such as gout and rheumatoid arthritis. However, INF-&#946; is an expensive drug, making the treatment costly. Moreover, the current treatment is systemic and has several side effects. Therefore, our team aims to use the non-virulent strain of Leishmania donovani to constitutively produce and deliver INF-&#946; directly at the inflammation site. Since Leishmania is cultivable in large scale, so it could become an actual pharmaceutical product. Thus, we would decrease the treatments cost and minimize significantly the side effects.
https://teams.igem.org/1777	Foundational Advance	Circular RNA is a type of RNA which forms a covalently closed loop. They are known to be resistant to RNases due to lack of ends, and thus have extraordinary stability. Recently several naturally generated circular RNAs are found to act as miRNA sponges, and they are a new type of tumor suppressors, because the miRNA the regulate are linked to cell proliferation and cancer. Our team has designed fusion proteins to promote miRNA sponge circularization, which can make miRNA sponges more stable and potent. Our circular RNA sponges can be used as a new tool to regulate gene expression, and in the future, it may be used as a new type of anti-cancer drug.

In terms of medicine use, we can develop standards to use antibiotics reasonably. But agricultural uses of antibiotics produce environmental exposures in a variety of reservoirs, which are impossible to be guarded against. Our group has developed a simple, reliable and efficient method to measure the antibiotics.Our Tetracycline biosensor can detect the tetracycline residues in agricultural products (such as: meat, eggs, milk, etc.). Our group constructed the tetracycline inducible expression system. And through plasmid mediated, the system was transfected into Escherichia coli TOP10 and GS115 Pichia pastoris. It can generate a rtTA transcription activation factor in cells. RtTA combining with tetracycline antibiotics can activate the fluorescent protein expression system, which can indicate the residue level of tetracycline by fluorescence detection.

Our project is to create a magnetotactic E.coli (MTE) through synthetic biology methods.The previous researches have confirmed that the four main operons are essential for the magnetosome formation in other organisms! Firstly,we clone the relevant genes from genome-wide of Ms. gryphiswaldense strain MSR-1.Then we construct two plasmids containing the four operons. Finally co-transforming them into E.coli lead to magnetotaxis.The magnetotactic E.coli has a variety of applacations, such as targeted therapy,dealing with environmental pollution and so on.We focus on the application of microbial fuel cell(MFC).Fixing the laccase protein on the MTE membrane can make the laccase adhere to cathode stronger.Therefore we can replace the conventional platinum anode with biology catalyst.

India has the highest burden of TB with World Health Organisation statistics for 2013 giving an estimated incidence of 2.1 million cases of active TB. Culture-based detection requires 4 weeks, hindering rapid detection in patient samples. We aim to develop a robust and self-sustained genetic device for rapid diagnostics, with the speed of PCR combined with the robustness of a growth assay, even in resource poor settings. With a joint approach of experimental testing and modeling, we are targeting factors that regulate the cell cycle of M. smegmatis and E. coli as model organisms. Our genetic device, comprising of Detector, Oscillator and Terminator modules, will reduce the time span for TB diagnosis from weeks to hours in a cost-effective manner.

Designing and coordinating interactions in order to discover new drugs comes with a host of challenges. Our goal is to modify phage-assisted continuous evolution (PACE), specifically for protein interactions. PACE combines the bacteriophage M13 and <i>Escherichia coli</i> in a dynamic scheme whereby M13 only survives if it infects <i>E. coli</i>. This is achieved when the viral protein P3 is expressed. <b>SPACE-P</b> aims to incorporate a key-lock mechanism that regulates the expression of P3. In our model, the interaction between the protein HER2 and an affibody will be the key to open the lock. Over several phage life cycles, evolutionary pressure will favour the interactions with the greatest yield of P3, thereby increasing that phages virulence and the continued evolution of that particular affibody. Our method will reduce the time and cost of drug discovery and enable the interaction between many choose-able proteins.

The minimal cell only contains essential genes and both of them are the cornerstones of synthetic biology. MCCAP (Minimal Cell Construct and Analyse Panel) is a software targeted for screening the essential genes, based on new method which means: if the number of organisms which have this essential gene have reached 50 percent or more, it will be reserved. Then you can utilize the minimal gene set, which consists of the essential genes that the software has filtered, to structure the metabolism network for modularization analysis. What is more charming is its functions in different fields, varying from biological research to pharmacy. MCCAP will inspire your interest by producing antimicrobial drug targets, making the chassis of artificial cell, promoting the synthesis of bacterial strain which is more adapted to the needs and helping determine the last universal common ancestor(LUCA).
https://teams.igem.org/1783	New Application	Alternative methods of plasmid maintenance and PCR amplification accelerate the construction of new biodesigns, reduce cost, and avoid environmental hazards. Plasmids are typically maintained in cells by encoding enzymes that hydrolyze or otherwise detoxify antibiotics added to the medium. However, this process carries an inherent risk for spreading antibiotic resistance to native bacterial populations through lateral gene transfer. The Hok-Sok toxin-antitoxin system, a natural internal maintenance cassette relying on internal mRNA silencing, presents an alternative to common antibiotic-based methods since it does not rely on exogenous drugs. We are also developing an integrated, microcontrolled thermocycler using common household components. Using nichrome wire and a motorized fan for air circulation, the programmable prototype is an inexpensive, versatile thermocycler or plate incubator. Because the material and construction costs are a fraction of dedicated instruments, the newly developed unit will find broad application among nascent synthetic biologists in underfunded environments.

https://teams.igem.org/1785	Software	Choosing apt and reliable protocols for new experiments is a problem that wet labs routinely face due to the difficulty in anticipating which protocols will produce the best results. Experimental practices may differ immensely across laboratories and precise details of these practices may be lost or forgotten as skilled faculty or students leave the lab to pursue other endeavors. Furthermore, there are few well-defined protocols that are generally agreed upon by the scientific community, in part due to the lack of a system that can supply a measure of a protocols acceptance. In order to address these problems, we set out to build a database that integrates a crowd-sourced ratings and comments system to serve as a protocol curator that enables wet lab investigators to compare various protocol efficacies, quantify a protocols acceptance within the scientific community, and provide an avenue through which experiential knowledge can be communicated.

The sensing portion of the Lux system will reside in modified Shewanella oneidensis, engineered to produce changes in its electrical resistance in response to changing levels of AHL using this species's control of cytochrome production. Finally, another key component of our project is the design and construction of the eletcronic hardware necessary to measure S. oneidensis's changes in electrical conductance and act as an interface between this biological circuit and any electronic circuit it is to be coupled with, in this example, a digital clock.
https://teams.igem.org/1787	New Application	SDS-PAGE is a very popular technique used to separate proteins based on their size. Embedded proteins, invisible to the naked eye, are then visualized by staining. Among the various staining techniques, silver staining is easy to perform and highly sensitive. However, the outcome is a series of monochromatic protein bands. Previously, we observed that some proteins inherently produce different hues post-staining. We hypothesized that specific amino acid configurations yield coloured bands after reacting with silver staining reagents. To test our hypothesis, we created numerous amino acid motifs to elucidate the sequences that would generate specific colours following silver staining. Our findings will let us generate a molecular weight marker with the innate capacity of providing users colour-coded bands post-staining without the use of impregnating dyes. Our technology will also pave the way for new types of colorimetric assays using synthetic proteins.
https://teams.igem.org/1788	High School	Fungi capable of producing harmful mycotoxins flourish on a variety of widely consumed crops, notably bananas, tomatoes, potatoes, and grains. Such fungal infections significantly reduce sustainability and food production in developing countries, where lack of advanced food storage and mycotoxin exposure are responsible for severe economic losses and 40% of diseases. As such, our team focused on developing a secretable chitinase capable of hydrolysing the glycosidic bonds which compose the polysaccharide chitin, a key structural component in fungal cellular walls. By fusing LbCHI31 chitinase-encoding genes with a secretion signal peptide from alpha-amylase, we successfully generated an escherichia coli line that secretes chitinase specific to fusarium oxysporum, a major pathogenic fungi. LbCHI31 extracellular secretion and effectiveness were further quantified through characterization and analysis. This project will allow for easily accessible, cost-effective methods for producing effective chitinases that combat fungal infections, thereby increasing crop yield, stabilizing financial growth, and reducing famine globally.
https://teams.igem.org/1789	Manufacturing	Prokaryotic cells have been widely applied in synthetic biology and bio-engineering as the host organism. However, lacking of the compartmentation of the heterologous metabolic enzymes may cause a low production or efficacy of the product, especially when producing through a complex multi-enzymatic cascade. In this study, we developed a new method to accelerate a multi-enzymatic reaction by integration of a TALE-based scaffold system into the bacteria chassis. In this system, different TALE proteins, which could specifically target the corresponding DNA binding motifs, were generated and fused with fragmented GFP or multi-enzymes (e.g., IAAM and IAAH). The results showed that TALE-based scaffold system could not only efficiently guide the fragmented GFP around the DNA scaffolds and display strong fluorescence, but also promote the rate of IAA production. To our knowledge, this technique might provide a powerful way in synthesizing multi-enzymatic reaction programs in prokaryotic chassis for a wide range of application.

The two ends join a half-reporter enzyme called HAD. each half of the enzyme is attached a molecule such as color coded GFP. When the Gln H comes into contact with glutamine the closed ends, when the two halves of HAD enzyme connect the enzyme becomes active, followed by a color reaction which can be seen by the human eye. The source HAD enzymes comes from TERMOTOGA MARITIMA ,This bacteria is found in regions of hot springs and is therefor an extra Thermopile bacteria, and its enzymes are very stable.
https://teams.igem.org/1791	Food & Nutrition	Fusarium head blight (FHB) is a fungal disease that reduces grain yields and seed quality across the world. Fusariums airborne spores land on spikelets of flowering crops, producing trichothecene mycotoxins that inhibit cell processes. Gastrointestinal problems and feed refusal in livestock also occur if ingested. However pesticides controlling diseases like FHB have numerous economic and environmental costs. Our project represents a species specific and widely applicable solution to global agriculture problems using the synthesis of highly pure dsRNA as a topical fungicide. It has been shown that insect midgut cells taking up double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) are processed into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) by the Dicer enzyme. If the siRNA is complementary to a certain gene, RNAi can silence its expression. This project will target and silence essential Fusarium genes. Our design involves a scaffold where any dsRNA sequence of interest may be inserted for gene targeting within a specific species.

One factor contributing to CCD is the parasitic mite Varroa destructor, which feeds on bee larva. Current methods used to control V.destructor are inefficient and resistance is developing in treated populations. Using synthetic biology, we designed E.coli that produce the miticide oxalic acid in the bee gut. This method targets V.destructor by directly delivering oxalic acid into the mites, creating mite-proof bee populations. Biofilms Bacterial biofilms are the cause of 65% of all hospital acquired infections. Biofilms grow on surfaces of surgical tools and medical implants and are composed of a plaque of bacteria hidden in a matrix of extracellular DNA and sugars. Currents methods used to destroy biofilms are expensive, harsh, and often ineffective. We have created a cocktail of Nuclease and Dextranase designed to degrade the biofilm matrix, allowing for the safe elimination of biofilms.

Additionally, we are creating a suite of gRNAs that will allow for CRISPR/dCas9-mediated transcriptional repression.
https://teams.igem.org/1796	Environment	The discovery of Kepler-452b called public attention on space migration again. As a matter of fact, the immigration to Mars, the most earthlike planet in solar system, still should be considered as priority. It is noticeable that CO2 and N2 occupy almost 98% of Martian atmosphere. Thus, we engineered two types of E.coli, which carry out anaerobic carbon fixation with Acetyl-CoA Synthetase/Carbon Monoxide Dehydrogenase(ACS/CODH) system, and nitrogen fixation with Paenibacillus nitrogenase respectively. Based on this purpose, they are called E. Pangu collectively, which is named after the creator of universe, Pan Gu in Chinese mythology. E. pangu is designated to play the role of pioneer organism on Mars immigration. In addition, we used CRISPR-Cas 9 technique to confirm the reliability of our carbon fixation system and verified a promoter part which can be induced by Rhl and repressed by Las.
https://teams.igem.org/1797	Hardware	We the team Tsinghua 2015 have originated and developed light-controlled systems to manipulate genetic information in prokaryotes by combining the site-specific recombination system with light switchers integrated from red, blue and green light systems. Through the On/Off commands from light switchers, genetic manipulation can be achieved when diverse combinations of light signal are provided. Specifically, three light-mediated platforms are established: bio-imaging platform, genetic editing platform and information storage platform. For the first part, the expression of fluorescent protein can be precisely controlled by the incoming light, forming pre-determined image pattern with drastically high resolutions. For the second part, dCas9 and DNA-binding-domain-deleted recombinase are linked together to smoothly alter genetic information without introducing double strand breaks. For the third part, artificial information can be stored and retrieved easily via light-mediated systems. We designed CRISPR-recombinase screening systems, measured fluorescent protein expression parameters and developed a light-emitting electronic device to support our project.

Our project consists of two ideas, both revolving around utilizing bioengineered microorganisms to create non-psychoactive cannabinoids and non-addictive analgesics. To achieve this we developed two projects: (1) Manufacturing a protein expression system to produce CBDA synthase in tobacco plants using agrobacterium, (2) Engineering the pGAP&#945; vector system to express the mambalgin in Pichia Pastoris as a continuation of the 2014 GSU iGEM project. Simultaneously, we developed a proof of concept using horseradish peroxidase. By the end of this project we hope to have produced a synthetic biological system to manufacture pharmaceutical alternatives for patients that suffer from diseases such as epilepsy, cancer, or chronic severe pain.
https://teams.igem.org/1801	Village	Graphene is a two dimensional nanomaterial composed only by carbon atoms that merge in hexagonal patterns. Its molecular structure gives it unique physical and chemical characteristics. One method to synthesize graphene involves the reduction of graphene oxide (GO) into functionalized graphene (rGO). This method requires the use of dangerous chemicals that threatens the environment and our health so its use is limited only to laboratories that produce it in small scale. We were able to successfully reduce GO into rGO using an organic molecule derived from glucose and evaluate the physical properties of the obtained rGO. Our plan is to transform P. pastoris GS115 so it can express glucose oxidase (GOD) and gluconolactone oxidase (GLO) enzymes and the reducing agent can be synthesized from glucose. We hope that this projects results allow the production at an industrial level of graphene in order to help trigger the technological revolution of graphene.

https://teams.igem.org/1804	Health & Medicine	Conventional chemotherapeutic drugs are unable to penetrate the tumour core, and a drug delivery vehicle is needed for effective delivery of therapeutics. Facultative anaerobic bacteria possess the ability to colonise the tumour core, and pose as suitable vectors. To ensure specific control of bacterial vectors, we intend to implement a two switch regulatory system, consisting of an anaerobic-responsive FNR promoter and a quorum-sensing system (QS). An anaerobic-responsive FNR promoter can be used to localise transcription of the target gene in the hypoxic tumor core. The second switch will use the esa QS system from Pantoea stewartii to activate bacterial density induced transcription of genes. The above two systems could be coupled to drive the expression of invasin and listeriolysin, which facilitate bacterial invasion and endosomal escape into the cell cytosol. The bacteria vehicle would then be able to deliver an encoded therapeutic into the target tumour cells.

https://teams.igem.org/1806	High School	Heat management and regulation is one of the biggest issues of 21st Century. Especially after the development of the refrigeration technologies, the world has adapted to thermo-regulation systems in real-life application, industry and science. This continuing adaptation has led to the dependence on temperature wise systems and their maintenance. The system we wish design in this occasion hopes to combat the issue of heat regulation that contests scientists and firms alike. 'Mr. Pyrofrost' will maintain the temperature of the system at a specific temperature through the functioning of two inversely affecting reactions regulated by the temperature of the system itself. The system stimulates an endothermic reaction pathway in higher temperatures and an exothermic reaction pathway in lower temperatures with one system inhibiting the other during function. The heat conditions of the system will both affect the functioning of 'Mr. Pyrofrost' and also be regulated by 'Mr. Pyrofrost'.

Current methods routinely used to remove phosphate involve chemical approaches, which themselves can be polluting. Our project builds on the enhanced biological phosphate removal process, using natural bacterial communities as an alternative to these chemicals. We are engineering <i>Escherichia coli </i>to enhance its phosphate acquisition. This will be achieved by upregulation of the native phosphate transport and metabolism genes. We will also add heterologous genes from proposed phosphate accumulating species. Target gene selection is assisted by computer based metabolic modelling. We are improving assays used to determine the phosphate accumulation levels, achieved by our genetically engineered bacteria. New European legislation will require water companies to decrease their maximum phosphate concentrations from 3 mg/L to 0.1 mg/L. Here we hope to engineer an organism which helps to achieve this in a clean and economical way.
https://teams.igem.org/1808	Village	Semi-synthetic artemisinin is perhaps the poster-child achievement of synthetic biology. Before its introduction, the sole artemisinin supply was from a plant; Artemisia Annua. The production was expensive and highly variable. Artemisinin is currently the front line treatment for malaria, a disease transmitted in the bites of Anopheles mosquitoes. One of the deadliest diseases in human history, malaria now claims over 600,000 lives a year. The majority of these lives are young children, and residents of developing countries, where people are unable to afford the drug. Our mission is to investigate the production of affordable antimalarial drugs. Our team is working with artemisinic acid producing e-coli cells, obtained from Amyris, with the support of Zagaya. We have constructed biobrick components of the system, which should allow for easier research and development in the future.
https://teams.igem.org/1809	WIKI	Antifreeze proteins (AFPs) have evolved in numerous cold-dwelling species to protect against the formation of cell-lysing ice crystals in subzero temperatures. AFPs have many applications from tissue preservation to food security and more, but recently a novel application has emerged: inhibiting biofilms. Biofilms are problematic in many settings including healthcare, manufacturing, and the environment. The use of AFPs as anti-biofilm factors is intriguing, however, only a single AFP has yet been shown to inhibit biofilms. We built a diverse library of AFPs and characterized both their antifreeze and biofilm-inhibiting properties in E. coli. Our results demonstrate novel biofilm-inhibiting properties for some AFPs and further characterize the freeze protection properties of many AFPs at low subzero temperatures. Our results will inform the design of novel synthetic AFPs optimized for use in E. coli, and provide a valuable new resource for the integration of AFPs into synthetic biology and biotechnology applications.
https://teams.igem.org/1810	WIKI	Current treatments for diabetes are effective in the short term but require patients to constantly monitor their blood sugar. We aim to create a durable system that can independently regulate blood glucose levels to prevent hyperglycemic crises and improve the quality of life of type II diabetics. We engineered E. coli that can detect changes in blood osmolarity and release pharmacologically active tripeptides in response. The tripeptides act on the kidneys by inhibiting the SGLT1 and SGLT2, two channels proteins that re-uptake glucose out of the urine. By inhibiting this reabsorption, the body is able to excrete excess glucose to counteract hyperglycemia. As of now, our system relies on a general sensor for blood osmolarity, but future studies will implement a more specific sensor for glucose through a modification of the lac operon.
https://teams.igem.org/1811	Environment	Copper is a major pollutant in a variety of freshwater ecosystems. When copper is oxidized from Cu+ to Cu2+, it often produces a free radical known as a reactive oxygen species (ROS), which is capable of severely damaging biological molecules. E. coli have the ability to uptake copper, but after a certain threshold, the copper becomes toxic to the cell. Due to the toxicity of copper, E. coli quickly saturate and are unable to uptake more than a small amount of copper. Our goal is to increase the efficiency of copper uptake in E. coli for the purpose of bioremediation in freshwater ecosystems. We engineered E. coli to express the yeast CUP1 gene in an attempt to increase copper tolerance. CUP1 encodes a metallothionein protein that binds 11 copper atoms, thereby preventing formation of the ROS. In addition, metallothionein detoxifies hydroxyl radicals with its cysteine groups.

https://teams.igem.org/1813	Village	Honeybee Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) is a serious problem, given the ecological and economical importance of honeybees. Experts estimate that honeybees pollinate $14 billion worth of crops per year in United States. Though the mechanisms which CCD occur are many fold and remain uncertain, neonicotinoid pesticides have been implicated. Gilliamella apicola is a bacterium that natively resides in the bee midgut. Our project aims to engineer Gilliamella to metabolize imidacloprid, a common neonicotinoid, into harmless organic compounds using three cytochrome P450 enzymes: CYP6CM1vQ, CYP6G1, and HUMCYPDB1. Though 6-CNA, the breakdown product of imidacloprid, displays significantly lower toxicity, it still induces sublethal effects. As such, we have also incorporated a pre-existing 6-CNA degradation pathway from Pseudomonas putida for complete breakdown of imidacloprid. We believe honeybees that harbour this engineered bacterium in probiotic form will become less susceptible to common field doses of imidacloprid; thus, significantly reducing the risk of CCD.

Such sampling assesses the concentration and presence of chemicals vital to optimal growth. In contrast to most of the toxic reagents used in the industry standard, we propose the construction of a device that will utilize biological means to detect nutrient value. What harmful reagents cannot be substituted will be minimized within a microfluidic chip housed in a mobile device with a compatible app, limiting exposure and increasing the accuracy of the results. The physical manifestation of our project will take the form of a Bio Art Installation, utilizing data taken from NYC backyards. Various graphic charts and laboratory consumables, light sources and color-aid papers will be employed to form a cohesive aesthetic experience, in keeping with the parameters of New Media art, reflecting recent trends in urban gardening.
https://teams.igem.org/1815	Foundational Advance	Communication between cells is instrumental in coordinating population-level activity. In a process known as "quorum sensing," bacteria both secrete and sense autoinducer signaling molecules to enable synchronization of group gene expression paradigms. The synthetic biology community has rapidly adopted these quorum signaling pathways for use in programmed circuitry. However, chemical signals must diffuse between sender and receiver cells, limiting such communication to a common environment. In electronics, when electrical signals must be transferred between two circuits operating at incompatible voltages, electrical engineers use optocouplers, components that transfer information between isolated circuits via light. The 2015 Penn iGEM team presents a biological analog of the optocoupler, a cell-to-cell communication system in which a "sender" cell generates light via bioluminesence and a "receiver" cell expresses photoreceptors to enable light-dependent physiological responses. We show that light elicits a response in light-sensitive receivers and illuminated potential applications for this alternative form of cell communication.

https://teams.igem.org/1818	Health & Medicine	Our goal is to functionalize the CRISPR-Cas9 system as a therapeutic for the targeted disruption of deleterious genes in human cell cultures. This will entail the delivery of the Cas9 endonuclease and guide RNAs through the cell membrane and into the nuclei of somatic cells such that double-stranded breaks can be induced at the desired loci. We seek to leverage the cellular penetration capabilities of the atoxic Clostridium difficile toxin B (aTcdB) which very efficiently mediates endocytosis and escapes endosomal capture. By adding Cas9 upstream of the catalytically inactive glucosyltransferase domain of the toxin, we hope to develop a recombinant fusion protein that will deliver into the cytoplasm an NLS-tagged Cas9 bound to a guide RNA. We aim to express the Cas9-aTcdB protein in Bacillus megaterium, transcribe the guide RNAs in vitro, and incubate this complex with HeLa cell cultures to excise a repressor and allow GFP to be expressed.
https://teams.igem.org/1819	WIKI	The accumulation of waste tires and rubber products represents a significant environmental problem worldwide. Current recycling techniques demand high energy consumption, and are completely overwhelmed by the annual amount of rubber waste. In addition, natural rubber degradation may take up to 1000 years. Here we aim to accelerate natural rubber degradation by genetically engineering Escherichia coli expressing two enzymes: RoxA (Rubber oxygenase) and Lcp (Latex clearing protein). For degradation of vulcanized rubber, the project includes a pre-treatment using Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans, a bacterium that naturally devulcanizes rubber. Both of these processes will be scaled up in bioreactors. The major resulting compound of the designed process is ODTD (12-oxo-4,8-dimethyl-trideca-4,8-diene-1-al), a triisoprene unit that we are working to transform in fuel, a product of high commercial interest. Consequently, besides enabling faster rubber degradation and decreasing final pollutant emission, our project also grants the final product a considerable economic interest.

The 2015 USU iGEM team is implementing a synthetic biology approach to design and create phage resistant Lactococcus lactis, a commonly-used cheese starter bacteria. The genetic mechanism behind this phage resistance functions by pairing a promoter that is activated in the presence of phage with a kill switch to terminate infected cells before phage are able to propagate.

In Indonesia, it is estimated that there are more than 120,000 cases with 800 deaths from dengue fever each year. To solve that problem, we will construct scFv (single chain fragment variable) antibody that can detect dengue virus antigen. This scFv can be produced by <i> E. coli </i> by means of plasmid transformation that has been fused with OsmY. That scFv antibody will be put in construction diagnostic kit. The kit will be able to detect dengue virus in the patients sample rapidly and accurately. The kit will also have an integration with our mobile-based software aimed at supporting the interpretation of detection results from our diagnostic kit and providing data of dengue fever cases in various areas.

The earth has blue marine, green continent and white polar region, and our E.coli, with implanted RNA thermometer, chromoproteins and signal molecules exchange system, will display the original state and the change of each part under the effect of elevated temperature. As we know, global warming will lead to ice melting, sea level rise and land desertification. When sensing the raised temperature, marine bacteria will open RNA thermometer and release signal molecules to erode costal and polar bacteria, gradually making them blue and showing the submersion of these regions. Meanwhile, when inland bacteria get warmed, they will turn yellow from green, showing the process of desertification.

The idea of Martian colonisation have captured our minds for generations. Creating a sustainable environment on Mars where humans could survive, however, is not a trivial problem. Synthetic biology could help provide a solution by creating genetically modified organisms capable of producing essential compounds for Mars-colonist survival. Our first step has been to make moss able to produce compounds essential for it to thrive on Mars. We focus on an antifreeze protein, as it could help the moss to survive the extreme temperatures found on the surface of the planet. Our second step is to produce compounds useful to colonists. Therefore, we have been working on getting it to produce resveratrol, as a proof-of-concept of medical applications.

Pathogens have evolved to develop resistance towards antibiotics, which is the common option for treatment. Antibiotic mode of treatment can be replaced by bacteriocins. Bacteriocins are novel peptides synthesised by an organism and have specific detrimental effects on the surrounding microbial community. These peptides can be produced by minicells which are achromosomal cells formed due to aberrant cell division, in this case induced by the overexpression of ftsZ. Pseudomonas aeruginosa will be used as the model organism for our studies. This strategy can also be used against organisms in biofilms. We have planned to study the effect of bacteriocins on Staphylococcus aureus which is the major organism in biofilm. Further we extend our work to a range of applications like strain selection, preventing botulism and animal husbandry.

Combining the Lpp gene sequence, ompA gene sequence (from E. coli), bgl I gene sequence (from Trichoderma reesei), and the signal sequence, we aim to create a particular strand that enables the E. coli to ultimately produce cellulase through a cell membrane protein. Nco I and Hind III with the sequence signal-lpp-ompA were inserted in the given vector.

However, there is a chance to reduce ComX level by overexpressing its novel antagonist, XrpA. The highly expressed level of XrpA protein leads to decreased biofilm formation. Our project aims two goals. The first one is to overexpress the production of XrpA in order to cease the production of ComX protein. The second one will implement CRISPR-dCas9 system in order to block the transcription of VicK gene. VicK is the gene of VicK/VicR signal transduction system in S.mutans that is responsible for acidity tolerance in bacteria. Thus, second system will combine sgRNA for VicK and dCas9 to reduce lactic acid production. Smart systems will be eliminated by blue light safety regulation system that targets origin of replication of the plasmid constructs.

Drawing inspiration from collective behaviors and cellular decision-making in biological systems, our team aims to engineer a synthetic model to understand the factors that play into reshaping community phenotypes. We have engineered novel sense-and-secrete circuits in yeast by repurposing the endogenous mating pathway and using fluorescent reporters to read out individual and community responses to a stimulus. We aspire to understand how intercellular signaling can shepherd noisy individual responses into robust community level behaviors. Particularly, we hope that by tuning parameters such as receptor level, secretion rate, signal degradation, and spatial retention, we will be able to customize communication to model natural systems and elicit distinct community phenotypes.
https://teams.igem.org/1830	Foundational Advance	Through the introduction of optimized genes from <i>Clostridium thermocellum</i>, we engineered a strain of <i>Lactococcus lactis</i> to express an extracellular platform, which can bind and harbor a seemingly endless variety of enzymes. By using the protein products known as cohesins and dockerins, we were able to create an organized and customizable array of enzymes on the outer surface of the cell. The cohesins are single elements orderly arranged as part of the scaffold and act as highly-specific bays for the display of the proteins of interest. The dockerins act as adaptors for the enzymes to be displayed, and allow them to anchor themselves onto the cohesin elements. For each type of cohesin element, there exists a complementary dockerin that binds specifically to it, which makes the scaffold a very powerful tool in the biotechnology landscape.
https://teams.igem.org/1831	Health & Medicine	Each year, increasing numbers of individuals are added to organ wait lists worldwide. This is met with an ongoing shortage of donor organs, in part, limited by preservation technologies. A human heart can currently be stored for 6 hours before significant tissue damage results in a non-viable organ. QGEM aims to use antifreeze proteins (AFPs), natural proteins that enable certain organisms to survive in sub-zero climates, to rectify this limitation. We have engineered two classes of AFPs focused on improving protein function and stability, respectively. Our primary objective has been the development of an anchoring system to increase local concentration of AFPs by attachment to a self-assembling scaffold. This system increases the probability of favorable interaction with ice surfaces thereby improving AFP activity. Our secondary project structurally modifies an AFP, enabling the protein to withstand a more diverse chemical environment. This increases potential industrial applications in food and energy sectors.

Our project is based on the recently reported paper-based sensing platform in which cell-free extracts were freeze-dried on paper with synthetic gene networks. Previous sensors were shown to be stable for over a year with refrigeration and able to give a readable gene output within 1hr. Our group is using this framework to sense new classes of biomolecules from human samples including hormones, proteases, and antibodies  specifically, estrogens in water sources, matrix metalloproteinases found in urine of patients with kidney, prostate, and colorectal cancers; Mucin 1-specific antibodies in human serum, a prognostic marker for colorectal, breast, and pancreatic cancer outcomes. Finally, we are also creating higher-order signal processing devices allowing conversion of analog gene circuit signals to a digital yes/no output.
https://teams.igem.org/1834	WIKI	Our project, ECOS, is a biological sensor designed to detect aromatic hydrocarbons found in soil. Due to human error, oil leakage is bound to occur, and because agriculture and the oilfield are closely intertwined, contamination is a cause for concern. ECOS, alginate beads containing modified E. coli, detects crude oil in a sample of soil or water. Detection of oil spills is a major issue because if oil contamination goes unchecked, the carcinogens found in oil can damage the crops and health of animals in the area. The current system for oil detection takes weeks before a sample is tested and returned. By this point, the result is invalid. ECOS allows detection of contamination on site and is easy to use. Testing can be done simply and accurately, allowing us to take action quickly and minimize health hazards in communities worldwide.

This phenomenon is explored as a circuit for sensing DNA sequence rather than protein. If a sequence is present, dCas9 will titrate away from a synthetic binding site upstream of a report gene to the desired sequence. In our project, we looked at this gene circuit in the context of detecting antibiotic resistance to activate a cell death gene. In preparing for this, we also performed a review of existing BioBricks and novel cell death genes in terms of their efficacy and safety. Other projects include the creation of a $200, garage bio thermocycler and further study of dCas9 repression with multiple orthogonal guide RNAs.

https://teams.igem.org/1838	Foundational Advance	This project introduces a novel glucose sensing system in which glucose-responsive promoters drive the expression of three reporter chromoproteins. We designed four novel glucose-sensitive promoters and tested their ability to drive expression of reporter chromoproteins at various glucose concentrations. In conjunction with existing glucose sensitive promoters from the Parts Registry, we used our novel promoters to design a biological device that expresses different combinations of the three different chromoproteins in response to glucose in Escherichia coli. As such, this device can detect a larger dynamic range of concentrations of selected molecules (e.g., glucose). Our project aims to provide a cheaper alternative for diabetics than current, more expensive, glucose-monitoring systems. While driven by this initial problem, continuing work has shown that our approach may have its greatest potential as a more general molecular sensing platform, capable of being easily customized for the sensing of a broad range of relevant compounds.
https://teams.igem.org/1839	Village	Cyanobacteria and several other organisms have evolved microbial sunscreens to survive in environments with high UV-A and UV-B radiation. These protective compounds, specifically mycosporines and mycosporine-like amino acids, defend against oxidative stress by quenching free radicals and preventing cellular damage. A putative mycosporine-synthesizing gene cluster in the cyanobacteria Anabaena variabilis has been characterized previously. Our team seeks to optimize these genes for high-volume expression in E. coli and study their effects on bacterial survival rates under high-UV environments. The standardization of these genetic components into the iGEM registry will help foster collaborative research into the potential applications of mycosporine-like amino acids as alternatives to toxic synthetic sunscreens, protection for terraforming bacteria in harsh UV environments, and as antibiotic-free selectable markers for genetic engineering.

To achieve this, the promoters of operons commonly found in P. putida are used. These are negatively controlled; the release of the repressor and thus the expression of subsequent genes is initiated by derivatives of glucose. Further, the engineered bacteria are encapsulated in alginate, a polysaccharide from brown algae. The capsule properties are tailored to best suit our engineered cells and possible applications. Agent-based modeling is conducted to model genetic networks, multiple-physics and growth models. In addition, the iGEM Matchmaker tool is deployed and enhanced with new functionalities.

Because of the cell penetrating peptide, the fusion protein will be able to get through the villi and get into the blood vessels. The special linker between these two components will be cut by the thrombin in the blood. That makes peptide YY still able to combine with Y2R to decrease appetite and help over-weighted people get back to fine diet.
https://teams.igem.org/1842	Measurement	Given the number of possible cellular conditions, existing approaches/mathematical models are limited in how they can predict and optimize metabolic pathways. The ability to stoichiometrically control enzyme levels allows for empirical testing of rate limiting steps. As a proof of principle, we tested our ability to identify rate limiting steps using the bacterial LUX system, a bioluminescent reaction, in Saccharomyces Cerevisiae. We have expressed several permutations of the bacterial LUX metabolic pathway to empirically determine its rate limiting steps by measuring the resulting light production. The identification of rate-limiting steps then allows us to optimize the pathway. Furthermore, with these findings, an improved and experimentally validated mathematical model of the LUX pathway will be constructed. By strategically altering biosynthetic gene expression, we have gained a means to tailor the reporter/sensor to better suit our needs (i.e. make it brighter) and a generalizable method to rapidly optimize metabolic pathways.
https://teams.igem.org/1843	New Application	In the past year, paper-based transcription and translation, reconstituted from freeze-drying, have been adapted in a variety of ways and shown to be effective after a year of storage at room temperature. However, currently, this technology is severely limited in its applications because protein detection requires a different strategy for each individual protein. Aptapaper uses the targeting specificity of aptamers to create a modular protein detection system that can easily be adapted to any protein. A DNA aptamer is bound to a DNA trigger and becomes unbound in response to its protein of specificity. This frees the DNA trigger to turn on an RNA toehold switch, resulting in a 40 fold change in reporter protein expression, with more results to come. This system, when freeze-dried on paper, is cheap and portable, making it well suited to tackle the unmet needs for disease detection in remote areas.

Our goal is to tap into this potential by creating a self-sustaining bio-factory of cyanobacteria - little fellows that need only CO2 and light - and product-producing E. coli, the general workhorse of the synthetic biology world. The cyanobacteria will create sugars from CO2 and sunlight, which it will release and feed to E. coli as a result of our applied synthetic genetic circuits. E. coli will then be engineered to use these sugars to create a product. In our proof-of-concept bio-factory, this product will be fuel. This platform, however, can be expanded to produce any product E. coli can make - medicine, plastics, commodity chemicals - as long as it is fueled by the cyanobacteria that only needs light and CO2.

Although diseases such as multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB), leprosy and syphilis primarily pose a threat to those living in the worlds poorest countries at present, increasing globalisation is rapidly transforming these diseases into a worldwide problem. This issue can only be addressed by developing an affordable diagnostic method that requires minimal training. <br></br> Enterobacteria phage lambda is a well-characterised virus of Escherichia coli, which has previously been used in the development of biotechnological tools. We aim to use this bacteriophage as the basis of a modular chassis with a variable host range. To facilitate identification of host cells in patient samples, these bacteriophages will deliver a chromoprotein gene into cells and drive expression, allowing diagnosis of a range of bacterial diseases by the simple observation of different colour changes.
https://teams.igem.org/1847	WIKI	Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) are indicators of the initial stages of metastasis. However, most state-of-the-art detection methods target only a few cancer-type-specific markers. We developed a bacterial signal processing system for sensitive and selective single-cell detection of CTCs in blood samples. We start by selectively inducing apoptosis in CTCs using sTRAIL before adding our engineered Escherichia coli, called MicroBeacons. Through the expression of the Annexin V protein on their outer membrane, MicroBeacons bind to the apoptotic CTCs. Upon binding, MicroBeacons detect the increased lactate production of the CTCs via a lactate sensor and trigger quorum sensing between each other, which results in expression of fluorescent protein. Overall, the MicroBeacons selectively generate stronger fluorescence on the surface of sTRAIL-sensitive and lactate-secreting tumor cells compared to healthy cells. We anticipate our device to be a reliable, fast, and cheap method for the detection of metastasis for a wide range of cancers.
https://teams.igem.org/1848	Food & Nutrition	Microbial consortia plays an essential role in nature - being involved in processes ranging from biogeochemical cycling to immune system development. The shared characteristic these consortia is the specialization of individual populations of microbes within the community. Given the specialization and regulatory controls available, a greater range of tasks and durability is made available. After all, cooperation and division of labor is the driving force behind emergent properties. Here, we present a method to engineer a synthetic consortia of probiotics, namely, Escherichia coli "Nissle" and Lactobacillus reuteri, to express PYY, Ghrelin, and GLP1 - gut hormones involved in regulating appetite and insulin production. Such an undertaking involves establishing a secretion system via signal peptides and an intra- and inter- species communication mechanism via AHL-based quorum sensing. It is to be noted that such a system is designed to be versatile with a gut consortia being one of many potential uses.
https://teams.igem.org/1850	Foundational Advance	Even under shear stress, pathogenic E. coli bacteria manage to invade the gut to cause disease every day. The secret to their success is a hair-like appendage called Type 1 Pili which is remarkably adept at binding to human epithelial cells in rough conditions. Inspired by nature, our team has adapted this system in a non-pathogenic strain to make E. coli into a specific binding machine for customizable targets. We will use it to address colon cancer. By fusing heterologous peptides to the adhesin domain, we first show that our mutant E. coli can be regulated to grab heavy metals like Nickel out of water. Next, we show a knock-out of the adhesive domain's pathogenic binding activity and introduce a peptide known to bind to colon cancer. We imagine our system might be used to localize an anti-cancer drug or toxic compound to early-stage cancerous growths within the colon.

https://teams.igem.org/1852	Foundational Advance	The manipulation of genetic material is key to the development of synthetic biology. The introduction of genetic material into different cell types is indispensable for the creation of genetically modified organisms which provide different benefits to society. However some techniques used for gene delivery into the cells have low efficiencies, can be expensive, or use complex equipment and are complicated to do. That is why in recent years it has sought new strategies for effective transformation of cells at low cost. One of these strategies is the use of nanotechnology, which has the potential of crossing cell membranes and increase solubility, stability and bioavailability of biomolecules, thereby improving efficiency of release. Here, we intend to evaluate the efficiencies of gene delivery of DNA-CNTs in Escherichia coli cultures, embryos in early development of Bos taurus and calluses of Nicotiana tabacum and compare them with the traditional methods used in the laboratory.

Conventional anticancer therapies are toxic to normal tissues & have incomplete tumor targeting. E.coli can selectively colonize solid tumors, providing a selective colonization in tumor tissue. Azurin blocks breast cancer cell proliferation and induces apoptosis. lUX qurom sensing system will be integrated into E.coli K12 expressing Azurin.

The generated data will be saved as a library in a microprocessor. A device will be fabricated using a color sensor to detect cells death rate. This will allow a selective expression of Azurin in the tightly packed colonies present within tumors, inducing apoptosis to tumor cells. Then creating a simple, Cheap & harmless device that measure the cell's death rate almost instantaneously.
https://teams.igem.org/1855	Foundational Advance	We aim to provide precision control over spatial arrangement of cells by designing a tool that enables drawing and building with them. Zinc finger proteins are intracellular molecules which recognise and bind unique dsDNA sequences. We have engineered these proteins to be expressed on the surface of an E. coli cell, such that dsDNA can be used as mortar to cement cells together. Producing a library of zinc finger proteins, along with their cognate dsDNA sequences, allows for combining different types of cells. We will demonstrate this principle by assembling fluorescent cells onto a 2D surface and producing microscopic images, with the ultimate goal being to build complex 3D structures comprised of different cell types. This level of control over cellular localisation could potentially revolutionise multiple fields including research into cell-cell interactions in microbial communities, multicellularity, and the construction of 3D cell structures in tissue engineering.
https://teams.igem.org/1856	Foundational Advance	We established a framework for implementing genetic manipulation techniquesspecifically, multiplex automated genome engineering (MAGE) and CRISPR-Cas9 systemsinto non-model, environmentally significant microbes using standard biological parts. The framework involves two components: (1) propagation and selection of cultures and (2) manipulation of cell genomes by MAGE and/or CRISPR. We identified design considerations for both components of the framework, and experimentally validated propagation and selection considerations using cyanobacterial strain Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 (a fast-growing cyanobacterium capable of lipid biofuel production) and Sinorhizobium tropici CIAT (a nitrogen-fixing rhizobium which forms root nodules in legume plants). We then developed a workflow for the design, construction, and testing of MAGE and CRISPR technologies in non-model prokaryotes. The insights we gained from validating the propagation component of our workflow will serve to improve the versatility and robustness of our framework and will inform the development of tools for genetic manipulation in other non-model organisms.

One was an efficiency of the circularization. The efficiency was lower in our previous study. This was why the splicing was hard to happen because two sequences to act as ribozyme for splicing were far each other. So we incorporated <b>complementary sequences</b> around the ribozyme regions. We thought that the treatment brought two regions close and the efficiency of the circularization improved.<br>   The other was to synthesize useful proteins. In our previous study, synthesized long-chain proteins lose their function because the folding of the proteins was broken. So we incorporated <b>linker sequences</b> into circular mRNA to synthesize the functional long-chain protein.<br>
https://teams.igem.org/1860	WIKI	The honeysuckle plant (Lonicera japonica) has been used against influenza infections in traditional chinese medicine for hundreds of years, but only last year the active compound, the microRNA 2911, has been identified. The mechanism remains to be verified, but it seems to interfere with genes from most influenza A virus strains, inhibiting their replication. While the traditional way of producing the compound is to grow the plant, dry the leaves, cook a bitter decotion from them and drink that decotion, we want to establish a biotechnological production in E. coli. The production shall furthermore be induced by light, for which we plan to use BioBricks from the Registry like the Cph8-EnvZ system. After our bacteria have produced enough of the miRNA, we want them to lyse themselves after a heat-induction. We plan on using the GroEL promoter in combination with a lysing cytotoxin, which remains to be chosen.
https://teams.igem.org/1861	Health & Medicine	Histone remodeling complexes including e.g. deacetylases or acetylasetransferases are fundamental for the control of gene expression by regulating the chromatin structure. Therefore a DNA-binding and a histone modification domain are required. Up to now, these domains are connected pre-transcriptional as fusion proteins. Alternatively, our team is developing a modular system consisting of SpyCatcher and SpyTag that forms a post-translational covalent isopeptide bond. To ensure sequence specificity, we fused a SpyTag to three different TAL effectors. For the epigenetic modification RPD3 was chosen, a histone deacetylase from <i> S. cerevisiae </i> highly conserved among eukaryotes, to which the corresponding SpyCatcher was added. Compared to established methods, this technique greatly simplifies the epigenetic applications that require the control of several gene loci simultaneously.
https://teams.igem.org/1862	Food & Nutrition	Problems like food spoilage are a major concern in our lives mainly because they have a direct impact on the health of a person. Food spoilage renders a product undesirable for consumption and is the outcome of the biochemical activity of a microbial community. It is known that bacteria often communicate with each other through quorum sensing, where the communication is through certain signal molecules (auto-inducers) that freely diffuse into the environment.The enzymatic activities that account for quality degradation of food products are regulated by quorum sensing activity. Our engineered organism can be used as a marker of freshness in different kinds of food (dairy and other packaged products) by detecting the presence of Acyl Homoserine Lactones using the Lux operon system in E. coli and rendering a visible colour change (through lycopene production), thus preventing the consumption of such food and aiding healthy living.

We have created two recombinant plasmids and transformed them into brewer yeast. This yeast is responsible for the production of dsRdRp fragment.

https://teams.igem.org/1865	New Application	Many industrial and biological processes require a range of different enzymes. Our aim is to provide a powerful tool to combine these enzymatic processes. The Flexosome is a multi-enzymatic complex, which ensures higher efficiency and yield from enzymatic reactions. Our construct takes multiple dockerins from a variety of bacteria and connects exchangeable enzymes to a scaffoldin base through automatic assembly. The combination of the catalytic forces of enzymes, derived from different sources, onto one common molecular base creates a synergistic effect. This drives a cascade in which the product of one reaction acts as the substrate for the consecutive one. In the future the Flexosome could, for instance, be used to combine enzymes in washing detergents or even link enzymatic cascades for the production of biofuels. It can therefore be applied from industrial over pharmaceutical to environmental setups.

This bacteria is to be placed in a bioreactor prototype which takes in any polluting exhaust (e.g. from a diesel generator, automotive engine, or chimney) with a controllable flow rate. This is then passed through the media containing our genetically engineered bacteria, which reduces all the above mentioned harmful gases to harmless by-products. Bubbling of the exhaust through water before going into the bioreactor also takes care of soot and other unburnt hydrocarbons.
https://teams.igem.org/1867	Health & Medicine	The NYUAD iGEM team aims to create a self-sustaining mosquito trap. The trap attracts mosquitoes by secreting indole and lactic acid, both of which are highly attractive to a broad range of mosquitoes. Indole is produced from tryptophan by E.coli with the genes tnaA and tnaB. Similarly, lactic acid is produced from fructose by E. coli with the gene lldD. After being attracted by the two organic compounds and flying into the trap, the mosquitoes will be stunned and electrocuted by an electric mesh. They will fall onto the medium containing the E.coli. The hard exoskeleton of the mosquitoes is digested by chitinase (produced by the gene ChiA in E.coli). With the hard outer exoskeletons removed, the mosquitoes serve as a carbon source to maintain E. colis growth, hence creating a self-sustaining system. We hope that this trap will provide a cheap, sustainable alternative to current mosquito traps.

https://teams.igem.org/1869	Manufacturing	Cyclopropane fatty acid (CFA) synthesis is triggered as a response to acid stress in <i>Escherichia coli</i> in order to chemical modify its lipid bilayer and decrease its permeability to surrounding acids. The addition of the cyclopropane ring to fatty acid chains creates a sterically hindered path for acidic compounds attempting to cross the plasma membrane, thereby reducing the passive entrance of unwanted acids. We are aiming to standardize this acid defense system so that it may be implemented in other microorganisms to increase their survival under low pH conditions. By utilizing acid-resistant microbes, it is possible to decrease the running costs of bioreactors that are hindered by acid buildup from metabolic processes. Moreover, given that microbes often transition to stationary phase during acid stress, this CFA system may enable higher cell densities and biosynthetic yields in cell cultures because genetically modified microorganisms may more readily tolerate acidic conditions during growth.
https://teams.igem.org/1870	Village	Xochimilco, one of the most important aquatic systems in Mexico City, has a huge environmental and social importance. It is home to many endemic species, as well as the main economic drive of the southern area. Due to its historical background, it is considered World Heritage by UNESCO since 1987. Currently, it presents several pollution issues such as an excessive amount of nitrites and nitrates, which in turn causes an overpopulation of Nymphaea, and thus anoxic conditions. As a consequence, flora and fauna endemic to the lake are dying. Our biosystem will activate a denitrification pathway taken from Pseudomonas stutzeri whenever O2 levels in the water are sensed as critical, using an O2 promoter. This enhances water conditions by reducing NO2 and NO3 into N2, and therefore algae and water lilies. Successfully implementing our biosystem will lead to a better future for the biodiversity in Xochimilco.
https://teams.igem.org/1871	High School	Industrial construction manufacturers recently switched to using paper instead of trees in some of their products. This leads to an excess of short chain cellulose fibers in the factorys water system. Microbes feed off the starches and produce odorous butyric acid. The current solution is to use biocides, but this is expensive, short term, and environmentally unsafe. Our solution is to engineer a S.cerevisiae cell to produce the alpha amylase enzyme from B.amyloliquefaciens. The alpha amylase breaks down the starch molecules in the water, removing the food source of the butyric acid producing microbes. The genetically modified yeast were tested in both soluble starch concentrations and industrial water samples. The amount of starch dropped from .006% to 0% within two hours. The amylase enzyme is able to degrade starch effectively in industrial water samples, making it a viable, sustainable, and environmentally safe treatment of industrial wastewater.

The anthocyanin delphinidin is plentiful in ripened blueberries and is responsible for giving them their blue color. Our goal is to engineer a biosynthetic pathway in the model organism Escherichia coli that produces delphinidin. Nine genes are required for the conversion of phenylalanine, which occurs naturally in E. coli, to delphinidin. We have cloned or synthesized all nine plant genes. Our approach is to assemble the nine plant-derived genes into 3 operons and express them in E. coli. Production of specific enzymes will be verified by immunoblotting and production of intermediate compounds will be monitored by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Production of delphinidin in E. coli will provide a robust phenotype that may be exploited to identify factors that can increase production of useful pigments such as delphinidin and also related compounds.

https://teams.igem.org/1875	Foundational Advance	While natural systems integrate diverse “digital” signals to precisely specify “analog” gene expression levels, synthetic systems thus far have focused on controlling expression in either a digital or an analog capacity. Our team sought to develop a “digitized-analog” expression system using CRISPR-dCas9, capable of specifying varied exogenous gene expression levels based on different signals. We first developed digital elements by pairing gRNAs with minimal operator promoters and using dCas9 to transactivate. We then created analog elements by multimerizing operator sites to obtain graded activation levels. Finally, we integrated our digital and analog elements into higher-order genetic logic circuits to achieve varying expression responses. We characterized and optimized our system in human cells, enabling synthetic biologists to better control transgene expression for important therapeutic applications.

However, they are not widely used due to high manufacturing costs and expertise required to use them. Our project improves accessibility to microfluidic hardware development within the synbio community through an intuitive platform to design and build simple continuous-flow systems. Neptune’s user interface allows researchers to easily specify high-level designs. It then validates, optimizes, and produces customized parametric blueprints of the setup. It guides users through manufacturing microfluidic chips and hardware at a cost orders of magnitude less than conventional methods. Users can then control and automate experiments through Neptune’s framework.

https://teams.igem.org/1877	Environment	Laboratories around the world use antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Resistance can spread from non-harmful strains of bacteria to potentially dangerous ones if these bacteria escape the laboratory. This year our team continued work on a passive killswitch for E. coli K12. The goal is to prevent environmental contamination by programming a death response in the absence of arabinose. After researching toxins for E. coli K12, we selected colicin E7, which E.coli produce to eliminate competition between species. Colicin E7 is FDA approved as harmless to Eukaryotic cells. The tetracyclin repressor protein is produced using an arabinose inducible promoter and the colicin gene is behind a tetracyclin repressible promoter. If the level of arabinose falls, as would happen in an accidental release, the Tet repressor will not prevent colicin production and consequently destroy the bacteria.

To achieve this goal, we established a reference for reporter expression by constructing and assaying plasmids with an arabinose-inducible promoter and genes for the reporters. Then, we constructed plasmids with the same reporters, but with promoters responsive to nitric oxide and hypoxia, the two conditions indicative of gut inflammation in both mice and humans. Future studies include co-culturing and testing the engineered bacteria with colon cancer cells, and developing new constructs to enable bacteria to report in the presence of malignant tumors. Photoacoustic imaging provides a non-invasive alternative for the detection of cancer and internal inflammation; success in this investigation would create new opportunities for infectious disease research.
https://teams.igem.org/1879	Environment	Synthetic biologists struggle to prevent the proliferation of genetically engineered organisms (GEOs) in natural systems. Containment methods that operate in ecological settings must provide security comparable to physical containment. Current methods fail to effectively inhibit horizontal gene transfer and environmental supplementation, and impose evolutionary pressure through the propagation of spontaneous revertants. Synthetic Translational Control (STC) currently utilizes a redesigned leucyl-tRNA synthetase and cleavage enzyme in an E. coli chassis to confer metabolic dependence on a synthetically modified leucine capable of conversion to L-leucine. Due to the semi-semantic property of this device, organisms cannot metabolically bypass our constraints using environmental supplementation and will display greater resistance to evolutionary escape relative to traditional synthetic auxotrophs. Our work provides advancement in biosafety by isolating GEOs from the environment via a reliance on modified metabolites. STC will become a benchmark for biocontainment devices and will allow for countless new applications in synthetic biology.
https://teams.igem.org/1880	Manufacturing	Taxol, generically known as paclitaxel, is a chemotherapy drug highly efficient in combating multiple forms of cancer via interference with the normal breakdown of microtubules during cell division. Deriving taxol from nature is environmentally unsustainable because the bark of the tree it is harvested from, the Pacific yew, grows too slowly to meet demands for taxol. Chemically synthesis is economically unsustainable because the intricate stereoisomerism and multistep pathway of taxol production result in low yield rates and high production costs. Manufacturing taxol via biosynthesis remedies the shortcomings of both aforementioned production methods; the need for the yew tree is circumvented and production cost is exponentially lower compared to the cost of chemical synthesis. Duke iGEM is optimizing the biosynthesis of taxol in E.coli by individually characterizing and then consolidating enzymes of the taxol biosynthesis pathway into a single strain for fermentation of taxol.

To address these problems, we developed Community-based Retro-synthetic Analysis Functional Platform (CRAFT), an open and self-acting software for user to customize their own circuit from base sequence level. CRAFT mainly consist of two closely interconnected modules, the automatic selection system, excogitating and choosing the most appropriate circuits and chassis species conform to user’s demand based on flux balance analysis (FBA), and the experimental scheme auto-generation system, providing standard protocol and unique data frame for previously selected pathways and chassis species, modifying FBA model with experiment data. In conclusion, our software have developed a more precise and self-revise system, integrating software design and experiment realization more closely, making complex synthetic system design accessible and practical.

However, the fact that few efficient and environment-friendly methods for hydrogen production constrains its application. Therefore, our team develope a biological production way, using the green algae - Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Since the hydrogenase activity will be inhibited in absence of oxygen and the algae can’t stop photosynthesis forever, we design a switch altering between 2 states in which light wavelength serves as extraneous inducible factor. In specific alternation, we utilize miRNA targeting the expression of key protein in photosynthesis, so we can select the hydrogen-production switch by regulating miRNA. In our design, we utilize Yeast-Two-Hybrid system and light-mediated fusion protein constructing a gene circuit where microRNA can regulate the specific downstream protein expression, and finally keep algae producing H2. In this way, the blue light switch regulate chlamydomonas producing intemittent hydrogen efficienctly, acting as blue-flame bubbling.
https://teams.igem.org/1885	High School	In recent years, the production of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) has increased rapidly, as a result of low production costs and consumer demands. PET is one of the most common plastic polymers, comprised of repeating monomeric subunits of Terephthalic Acid and Ethylene Glycol. It is frequently used in the manufacture of plastic bottles and clothing fibres, especially in Japan. As avid users of PET-based products, our team decided to research how to optimise the degradation of PET, which takes an average of 450 years to degrade naturally. We were further inspired to pursue this goal with Keio University’s recent discovery of Ideonella sakaiensis — a unique bacteria capable of PET degradation. Thus, we have focused our project on the synthesis of an optimal PETase biobrick, which would be included in the iGEM database. Ultimately, our goal is to find an ideal promoter to expedite the production and secretion of PETase.

Our team has constructed a special oscillator gene circuit manipulating two quorum sensing autoinducers to change periodically, and reach their peak value alternately. Inspired by Enigma machine, we intend to use our oscillator circuit to make a biological cipher machine, which is able to encrypt and decipher information consisting of two basic elements. In our design, blue and red fluorescence stand for two basic elements of input and output. When one protein reaches its threshold value, a corresponding gene circuit will be triggered, either to retain the original element, or to change it to the other one. Using this method, we could realize the periodic conversion of a code book, which is hard to be deciphered. We hope this design can be an innovative attempt to apply synthetic biology to information safety from the aspect of interdiscipline.

Nematode is a pest, which will attack the roots of crops. We wish to modify its behavior by engineering bacteria to produce biochemical cues to attract or repel the worm. We identified two potential biochemicals, cinnamaldehyde and phenylpyruvic acid, which are possibly attractant or repellent to the Nematode. We have designed a chemosensation assay to demonstrate the attraction and repulsion ability of the biochemical of interest. The results suggest that cinnamaldehyde is a strong repellent and phenylpyruvic acid is a moderate attractant to the worm. Genetic engineering of bacteria to produce the two biochemicals are working in progress.
https://teams.igem.org/1890	New Application	This project aims to engineer Escherichia coli to make biological microlenses and lasers. To produce microlenses, we express the enzyme silicatein in our engineered cells, which catalyzes polymerization of silicic acid. This results in a biosilica layer around the cell, enabling it to function as a microlens. Additionally, we will create biological lasers to improve current imaging techniques by expressing fluorescent proteins within biosilica-covered cells. A fraction of the photons emitted by fluorescent proteins are trapped inside the cell by the biosilica layer. Once these photons hit other excited fluorescent proteins, stimulated emission occurs. This process results in light with a higher intensity and a narrower color spectrum compared to conventional fluorescence. With our research we hope to contribute to the wide range of applications in the field of bio-optics and enable environmentally friendly and economic production of microlenses with applications varying from smartphones to solar panels.
https://teams.igem.org/1891	Foundational Advance	It’s widely known that taxol has noticeable effect to promote the inhibition of tubulin depolymerization and therefore stabilizing microtubules. Based on this, our team designed a new way to test the existence of taxol, which may have higher resolution than current chemical approaches. Firefly luciferase complementation (FLC) and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay is the core part of our experiments. We expressed one specific tubulin connected with N-luciferase and C-luciferase respectively. When α-tubulin and β-tubulin tend to form dimers, the normal microtubules are being assembled and are likely to be depolymerized. However, the extremely stable microtubules would be established if taxol exists in the system. By detecting the fluorescent signal, we are able to tell the existence of taxol.
https://teams.igem.org/1892	High School	Our personal health care taker E.coli expresses two proteins SDF-ELP and LL37 which can significantly promote chronic skin wound healing. Chronic skin wounds are characterized by poor re-epithelialization, angiogenesis and granulation. SDF (topical stromal cell-derived growth factor-1), though found effective to re-epithelialization, is rapidly degraded by high levels of protease around wounds. To solve this issue, we fuse SDF1 to ELP(elastin-like peptides) that can aggregate to form nanoparticles so to prevent against proteolysis and promote neovascularization, resulting in much faster re-epithelialization of chronic skin wounds. We also add an antimicrobial peptide LL-37 to avoid infection by preventing a wide range of bacteria growth. To enable our health care taker to be used by everyone, we devise a super-convenient product which only needs 4 simple steps “AAPH”( Add. Add. Press.

We propose to engineer a dual-sensor bacterium that can sense increased metabolite levels in its microenvironment and then respond by delivering biomolecules into target cells. As a proof-of-concept, Escherichia coli was engineered to detect increased level of lactate, then respond by attaching itself to a cancer cell marker, and subsequently release biomolecules into the cell. A kill switch will be activated when there is insufficient lactate present, thus minimising non-specific targeting. In addition, our delivery system also has the flexibility to detect other environmental metabolites, together with the ability to engineer the bacterium to bind to other cell receptors for their detection and thus deliver biomolecules.
https://teams.igem.org/1898	High School	Cataracts, the clouding of the lens, cause half of the world's blindness. Most cataracts are age-related and arise when crystallin proteins in the lens become oxidized and aggregate over time. Surgery is currently the only recognized treatment to effectively cure cataracts, but this method is expensive and invasive. Therefore, we formulated a natural and non-invasive alternative. In the eye, a natural antioxidant glutathione (GSH)—produced by the enzyme glutathione reductase (GSR)—exists to combat oxidation, but GSH levels decrease with age. Studies have also suggested that another enzyme—25-hydroxylase (CH25H)—can convert cholesterol in the eye into 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC), which reverses crystallin aggregation. We expressed and purified GSR and CH25H for the prevention and treatment of cataracts, respectively. To deliver these proteins through the cornea and into the lens, we engineered biodegradable chitosan nanoparticles, thus creating a natural and non-invasive alternative to surgery.
https://teams.igem.org/1899	Village	Our team aims at engineering a biological tri-stable switch which shows high orthogonality as bistable switch in Escherichia coli. Building on the Brown 2006 and 2007 iGEM teams’ design, the tri-stable switch which consists of three alternating steady states that can be toggled by three different chemical inducers is improved. The construct was constructed with three promoters, lacp, phlFp and an ameliorated version of tetp together with their corresponding repressors. This combination enables the switch acting more stably by preventing it from reverting back to its natural states. Mathematical analysis was performed to ensure a stable and robust behaviour of the switch. Being orthogonal and more stable, the tri-stable switch could be applied in different fields, like biosensing and biocomputing. If the system is further studied and developed, it is foreseeable that it could contribute to the mature integration of different circuits in the future.
https://teams.igem.org/1900	Environment	In recent decades the issue of coral reef decline has become a global issue. Some of this decline is due to Serratia marcescens, a gram-negative bacterium that contributes to the loss of Acropora palmata (Caribbean Elkhorn coral). Bacteriophage therapy, the focus of WLC-Milwaukee, is not a recent innovation but it could be the key to stopping the decline of coral reefs from this pathogen. Building on methods and research conducted by the 2015 WLC-Milwaukee iGEM team, we conducted screens to find bacteriophages that destroy or incapacitate this and other waterborne pathogens using a specific bacterial protein, TolC. Using Escherichia coli as a surrogate to express Serratia proteins, we can isolate Serratia-specific phages using a simple lab strain of E. coli. Looking ahead, we would like to increase phage specificity for S. marcescens as well as improve phage enrichment techniques that were previously developed.

https://teams.igem.org/1902	WIKI	Within the next decade, we are set to see the launch of a vast number of human missions to Mars. However, a major issue associated with space travel is Osteoporosis, a condition where there is a decrease in bone density. Osteoporosis is treatable with calcitonin pills and nasal sprays but these treatments are ineffective. Therefore we propose to use CRISPR/Cas9 to create a model to stimulate upregulation of calcitonin secretion within E.coli as a new treatment. We will be constructing plasmids that contain the calcitonin promoter region and the CRISPR/Cas9 system. These plasmids will be transformed into E.coli where we will test for the upregulation of calcitonin secretion using GFP and calcitonin assays. If the project is successful, it would provide a stepping-stone towards further gene-targeted therapies to treat health conditions that are acquired from space travel and could be used to treat osteoporosis in the elderly.
https://teams.igem.org/1903	Diagnostics	In Costa Rica, a man dies of prostate cancer every 27 hours in average, mainly because of late diagnostic. This compelled us to design a new diagnostic method using molecular techniques. For this, we use dCas9, inactive variant of Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9, to bind to an RNA biomarker found in the urine of men with prostate cancer. This dCas9 is engineered with a protease, which is released when the Cas9 binds to the biomarker RNA, due to a conformational change. The released protease cleaves a fluorescent protein-quencher dimer, thus allowing the FP to fluoresce and generating a measurable signal.
https://teams.igem.org/1904	New Application	Acinetobacter baumannii is a pathogenic, opportunistic bacterium responsible for infections in hospital environments, mainly amongst patients at ICUs. Nowadays, it has drawn major attention given its ability to acquire resistance to commonly used antimicrobial agents. Due to the widely-spread resistant mechanisms among microorganisms, antibiotics have lost their efficiency at eliminating pathogens up to the point of being non-efficient at all in the treatment of certain infections. TecCEM 2016 team is developing a novel, specific method to avoid Acinetobacter baumannii proliferation onto nonliving surfaces through cell wall lysis, as an alternative to current antimicrobials that promote antimicrobial resistance development. The use of endolysins ensures the elimination of the pathogen of interest, as specificity for Acinetobacter baumannii increases its efficiency. The purpose of formulating a disinfectant driven by endolysins is the sanitization of surgery and nursery equipment as well as furnishing, and other objects that are potential transmission vectors for Acinetobacter baumannii.
https://teams.igem.org/1905	High School	Early detection of sexually transmitted diseases is of major importance given the broad range of consequences they have on public health. Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) has raised concern throughout Mexico because of its incidence. The virus has been characterised and documented at the genetic and proteomic levels, but given its pathophysiology during infection, diagnosis at early stages is somewhat complicated and unusual, particularly because of the absence of symptoms. Moreover, it is of crucial importance as some HPV strains have been shown to correlate with oncogenic outcomes. TecCEM_HS 2016 is developing a rapid test method by using the novelties of riboswitch technology. With careful and appropriate design, bacteria could serve as a signal provider that may give insight into the viral presence by means of fluorescence. The device would thereby provide a money-wise, quick, and reliable way of concluding upon Papilloma's infection, serving as an alert for further physician assessment.
https://teams.igem.org/1906	Foundational Advance	XJTLU-CHINA aims to develop a novel in vivo method to construct DNA mutagenesis library. Unlike the conventional method that uses in vitro synthesized oligo-pools, we utilize a pathway constructed in bacterium Escherichia coli to guide the cells to mutate the DNA that has been preset as target. The mutagenesis guiding pathway that XJTLU-CHINA developed involves two major sections, the error-prone replication of RNA by Qβ replicase and the reverse transcription accompanied by retrohoming of group II intron. The ultimate product upon the ending of the pathway will be a mutagenesis library of DNA target of interest that ready for in situ characterization or harvesting for the future use. The new method will be inexpensive to use and supposed be more robust in performance.
https://teams.igem.org/1907	Environment	Cyanobacteria, also known as blue-green algae, are an annual problem in many water systems. During the summer, the bacteria release hepatotoxins called microcystins (MCs) which pose health risks to humans and animals. The goal of our project is to build a two-part system to detect and then degrade MCs. Our detection system is based on the natural oxidative stress response of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Exposure to MCs is linked to higher levels of oxidative stress, and we will couple this response to the expression of yellow fluorescent protein. Thus, fluorescence levels will indicate the amount of MCs present in a sample. To understand and validate our MC detection mechanism, we will also create mathematical and molecular models. For degrading the detected toxins, we will express and purify the enzyme microcystinase (MlrA), which is naturally found in some gram-negative bacteria. The enzyme renders the MCs harmless by modifying their structure.
https://teams.igem.org/1908	Diagnostics	Pancreatic cancer continues to have high mortality rates due the inefficiency of currently existing screening methods and treatments. Recent discoveries have demonstrated the heparan sulfate proteoglycan Glypican-1 (GPC1) as a more predictive biomarker for pancreatic cancer than the previously studied marker CA19-9. Additionally, GPC1 has been found to be present on exosomes in human blood serum before tumorigenesis. This project aims to use a biological system in S. cerevisiae to detect this biomarker via expression of the human Cripto-1(CR-1) transmembrane protein, a known binding partner of GPC1, as well as c-Src, a mitogen activated kinase. Binding of GPC1 to CR-1 leads to subcellular phosphorylation and activation of human c-Src kinase, resulting in downstream induction of the MAPK pathway. Through validated expression of CR-1 and increased phosphorylation of c-Src, this project aims to expand the potential for development of a non invasive biological sensor for early pancreatic cancer detection.
https://teams.igem.org/1909	Diagnostics	This year the iGEM Team Hamburg is determined to construct a biosensor against Chlamydia trachomatis, a pathogenic bacterium that is transmitted sexually. Rather than treating chlamydial infections, which can be easily done by broadband antibiotics, the problem is the diagnostic identification of the exact bacterial strain. Current diagnostic methods are costly, since they mostly rely on immunologic methods like antibody staining, ranging between 30 to 150 Dollars. This is fine in industrial nations, but for many people in developing countries living close to the poverty line (earning 1.25$ per day) the cost is far from affordable. To combat this, the iGEM Team Hamburg is constructing a fusion protein with a signaling pathway to function as a biosensor in prokaryotes, to subsequently offer an inexpensive alternative to present diagnostic methods for medical doctors in developing countries.
https://teams.igem.org/1910	High School	An estimated 8.5 billion tons of poultry feathers are produced from farms globally every year, in addition to the tons of human hair that are removed from wastewater treatment facilities worldwide. Keratin waste is typically disposed of through incineration, burying the waste, or mechanical processing that yields low-quality protein products. All these processes take their toll on the environment. However, Keratinase is a serine protease that primarily attacks the disulfide bonds in keratin waste—such as feathers and hair. Thus, the expression of bacterial keratinases provides an opportunity to manage this degradation-resistant keratin waste and turn it into a high quality protein product such as fertilizer or animal feed. To do this, two Keratinase Genes isolated from the Bacillus genera are used. Keratinase A (kerA) is more active in degrading keratin in feathers, while Keratinase US (kerUS) is most effective in degrading the keratin in hair.
https://teams.igem.org/1911	High School	The concentration of proteins in a cell is determined by both the amount synthesized and the amount degraded. Thus, protein degradation is a crucial aspect of maintaining intramolecular equilibrium. A class of ATPases known as AAA+ Proteins involves a well-known proteolysis mechanism known as ClpXP in which ClpX unfolds and translocates a tagged protein into a sequestered proteolytic compartment in ClpP. We devised an inducible genetic construct in which ClpXP will degrade a chromoprotein upon induction. The data will be gathered using a device that can quantify the color of the light reflected by the chromoprotein before and after induction. This will ultimately allow us to measure the relative strength of degradation and further characterize a well-known proteolysis mechanism. Our characterization of ClpXP will serve as a precursor for controlled protein delivery in medicines and subsequently a switch for biosensors.
https://teams.igem.org/1913	WIKI	The abundance and diversity of our food relies on honeybee pollination. Varroa destructor mites weaken bee colonies through the spread of disease. Our team aims to save bees by killing Varroa using bacteria inside beehives. In continuous conversation with beekeepers and scientists we develop a bacterium that targets mites, leaving bees and humans unaffected. The hive-localized bacteria sense Varroa and produce mite-specific toxin, eliminating the need for beekeepers to dose the product. The bacteria are dependent on a synthetic amino acid and are shut down by light to confine them to the hive. Additionally, we develop an in vitro test of Varroa toxicity to show the utility of our bacterium. The system is modeled in various ways to assess its viability in the real world. This is the first effective method to combine specificity, ease of use, safety through bio-containment, and the iGEM open source character to save the honeybee.
https://teams.igem.org/1914	WIKI	“Kill switch” is a blanket term often used to describe a system that causes controlled cell death and is used as a way to safeguard against the effects of GMOs on wild type organisms. The lack of quantitative data on devices of this kind has become the basis of our project this year. We are testing three types of kill switch: a chemical kill switch using the fluorescent proteins Killer Orange and Killer Red which damages and destroys the cell with reactive oxygen species; an enzymatic (lysozyme) kill switch that lyses the cell on production; a DNase kill switch that targets DNA disruption. Through individual tests and a continuous culture we are testing both the efficiency and the stability of each kill switch, looking at the potential difference of plasmid or genome integration, hoping to provide effective characterisation and insight into their suitability as effective biocontainment methods.
https://teams.igem.org/1915	Manufacturing	Cannabinoids, opiates, and venoms are used in the production of pharmaceuticals; unfortunately, these drugs can have adverse side effects or be costly to manufacture. With our project we aim to produce biological systems that manufacture the conjugates of these pharmaceutical that have less adverse side-effects, lack addictive properties, and are inexpensive. To achieve this, three protein expression systems were designed: (1) An Agrobacterium based system in tobacco plants for the synthesis of CBDA synthase, (2) Engineering the pGAPz alpha vector system to express mambalgin in Pichia pastoris, (3) and Manufacturing the constructs of Lethal Toxin-Neutralizing Factor LNTF-10 and LNTF-15 which are serum derivatives of the Didelphis virginiana (opossum) in the pSBC13 vector for assembly in Escherichia coli. By the end of this project, our goal is to have designed systems that produce cheap pharmaceutical derivatives for patients who suffer from chronic pain, epilepsy, or the misfortune of a snake bite.
https://teams.igem.org/1916	Food & Nutrition	Color is innate in food perception and consumers expect vivid colors -- beyond those already present in food. Due to backlash against artificial colorants, some large food companies have pledged to exclusively use natural food colorings, which may result in the disappearance of some brightly colored food. This is a complex transition as there are limited natural options for food pigment and the regulatory framework is evolving. In this project we show that cyanobacteriochrome (CBCR) proteins are a viable and natural alternative to artificial food dyes. Mined metagenomic data was used as a source of novel proteins to produce CBCR colors in an effort to expand the color spectrum of natural food dyes. In order to find the optimal genetic circuit for maximizing protein production, different operon structures were also explored in E. coli. Lastly, we worked towards expressing CBCR’s in a GRAS organism, B.subtilis, to address human consumption concerns.
https://teams.igem.org/1917	Therapeutics	Liver cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the world. Egypt has a one of the highest incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the world. Treatment options for HCC are limited and often inefficient. Circular RNAs(CircRNA) belongs to the family of noncoding RNAs. They play a role in gene expression regulation and act as miRNA sponge. Recently, it was found that their levels are deregulated in various types of cancer. Using bioinformatics analysis, we have identified certain circular RNAs that are down regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma. So, we are aiming to design a system that can sense CircRNA deregulation in the HCC and respond in a way to restore the balance and equilibrium in the CircRNA environment of the cancer cells. Also, we are evaluating the therapeutic effect of CircRNA as a potential novel target for the treatment of HCC.
https://teams.igem.org/1918	Information Processing	When information flows through gene-regulatory networks, noise is introduced, and fidelity suffers. A cell unable to correctly infer the environment signals from the noisy inputs may be hard to make right responses. But what if the network structure is altered? What if a “parallel circuit”, where independently transcribed monomers assemble into functional complexes for downstream regulation, is in place of a “series circuit”? Inspired by information theory, we scrutinize noise propagation in parallel information channels, and construct synthetic biology circuit using split florescent proteins and split dCas9 to quantitatively measure the capacity of these information channels. Computation and wet lab work are combined to optimize our understanding of such systems, and to interpret potential biological significance of reoccurring parallel designs in nature.

This year we designed an innovative insole called "Comfootable" to prevent them with two strains of engineered E.coli whose names are "Rihanna" and "Drake" respectively.VHb gene is involved in both strains to enhance their growth ability in tough environment and some genes in two strains are knocked out to keep the strains themselves odorless. In strain "Rihanna" antimicrobial peptide CecropinXJ is supposed to be released and attack pathogens after foot temperature inducement. In strain "Drake" liv operon/polyleucine peptide/aminocyl-tRNA and aarC are expected to remove the malodor in shoes. This insole has specialized structure and proper material to make sure the successful diffusion of substrate the availability of microorganism growth and the biosafety. Furthermore we did a lot of modeling works and we hope our product will be available on the market some day.

Do you even know that every 7 SECONDS, diabetes caused disease take one life away? We designed a non-invasive, convenient and electronic device with a reusable sensor for monitoring real-time glucose in urine daily instead of traditional pricking detection. U-KNOW is a two-feature system, which can diagnose glucose level and auto-resetting. E. coli senses the urine for the glucose level, on the other hand, enterokinase degrades E. coli to configure the initial status for the next user. After detection, the collected data is converted into digital signals and sent to the App. This biosensor technique does not only empower diabetic patients to manage diabetes, but also alarm for non-diabetes to take care of their health simply. Prevention is better than cure!
https://teams.igem.org/1921	Environment	TJUSLS China's subject of the competition for this year is the surface display to modify PET hydrolase(PETase). PET hydrolase was found from a kind of microorganism living on PET as the main carbon source. It can degrade macromolecular polymers into monomers. Surface display can reveal the protein whose gene code is coalescing the gene code of target protein or polypeptide with the counterpart of ankyrin on the surface of the host cell wall to harvest the whole cell catalyst. The protagonists of our project, which are PETase and the surface display technology, will act in two aspects. Firstly, create the mutant of PETase in order to improve the degradation efficiency and thermal stability. Secondly, useing surface display on the surface of the prokaryotic (Escherichia coli) and eukaryotic (Pichia yeast) for whole cell enzyme catalysis reaction.

The carbon dot serves as photosensitizer intakes 670 nm light and brings heat effect, helps lysosome escaping. We joined two materials with SO2 and transport the complex into the breast tumor cell, start apoptosis by ROS from sodium copper chlorophyllin on C-dot. To solve the anti-apoptosis regulation, we designed gene-targeted shRNA attached onto C-dot. When it enters the cell, the shRNA silences SIRT1 mRNA to accelerate apoptosis. The UCNP complex provides solution of lysosome escaping and has higher efficiency than traditional photodynamic therapy.Further more,it shows high stability and low cell toxicity without light exposition ,to be considered a more advanced solution of breast cancer.
https://teams.igem.org/1923	New Application	iGEM 2016 team Tsinghua designed and developed an in vivo CRISPR/Cas9-based gene mutation surveillance system in yeast, which can monitor the occurrence of mutations within specific coding sequences and respond by triggering suicide of the monitored cell. It has been reported that with the assistance of PAM-presenting oligodeoxynucleotide (PAMmer) and specifically designed single guide RNA (sgRNA), dCas9 protein can bind to the mRNA of the target sequence while not recognizing the DNA template. Our system has two subsystems, the RNA monitoring system including dCas9, sgRNA and in vivo PAMmer-generating device, and the suicidal gene expression system, which are coupled by a modified dCas9 protein. The dCas9 is equipped with a nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequence, and a transcription activation domain. dCas9 would remain bound to its target mRNA and thus trapped in cytoplasm under normal circumstances, and translocate into the nucleus to initiate suicidal gene expression once a mutation occurred.

Researchers have managed to use chemical or biological methods to block these ways individually in vitro and achieve remarkable effect on cancer cell, but these could never be turned into practical use. We adopt safe replicative-deficient adenovirus to deliver tandem shRNAs targeted at several metabolic pathways simultaneously, which are driven by cancer-specific promoter. To test efficiency of different ways to assemble shRNAs in series, we also design a switch to control their expression in vitro. This engineered adenovirus, which we called ‘AdVENTURE’ would be a powerful and precise tool among various cancer therapies.

They aim to create a diagnostic test for resistant bacteria so fast, cheap and easy to use that it can be used anywhere, at any time. Not only will they detect dangerous bacterial enzymes, but by reimagining CRISPR/Cas9-technology, the team proposes a design of a gene detection tool that can detect also the resistance genes themselves. Along with their test they present PhoneLab - an app of their own design to interface with their test. By improving diagnostics, unnecessary and wrong use of antibiotics may be prevented, enabling us to contain the spread of resistant microbes before it becomes too late for all of us.

The need for effective early-stage detection methods is urgent. However, due to defects such as complexity and high cost, the promotion of current methods is hindered. Thus, we come up with a new type of low-cost and high-sensitivity testing method. Freeze dried on paper with cell-free expression system, each plasmid consists of a strong promoter, a toehold switch and a downstream reporter gene, functioning as a biosensor. The reporter gene is activated only when a specific sequence of HCV RNA binds the toehold switch, and therefore enabling qualitative and quantitative assay of HCV. Our method has great advantage in sensitivity and the range of application, providing accurate information for subsequent treatment.
https://teams.igem.org/1929	Therapeutics	Gastrointestinal (GI) cancers have the highest cancer mortality rate in Canada due to difficulties in tumour diagnosis and treatment. Common anti-cancer therapies used today can lack specificity and have off-target effects, damaging the body in the process. Our focus is to engineer commensal Lactobacillus bacteria to bind and aggregate towards Her2+ GI tumours. Membrane-anchored binding proteins specific to Her2 will be engineered into Lactobacillus to redirect bateria for aggregation at the tumour site. With sufficient bacterial density, a quorum sensing mechanism triggers production of a vital T cell activating cytokine, interleukin-2 (IL-2), to recruit tumour-specific T cells for an anti-cancer response. Simulations of the bacteria in a possible tumour environment will help drive quorum-sensing design (e.g. promoter sensitivity). Ethical concerns were addressed through research into the feasibility of such a treatment, particularly into methods to minimize health risks, make the treatment financially accessible, and abide relevant legislation.

However, nature has been encoding enormous amounts of information in DNA for billions of years. By introducing a sequence into DNA of bacterial spores, one of the most resistant-to-harsh-conditions forms of life, “CryptoGERM” tries to combine storing information and transferring it in a safe way. The goal is to safely send a key and an encrypted message in two separate spore systems of Bacillus subtilis. Digital and biological protection layers will prevent this information from being captured by unauthorized parties. The message is protected by computational encryption, while the sensitive key can only be accessed from the spores with the right growing conditions. For example, light-switchable antibiotics have to be activated by the correct frequency of light. If the recipient fails, the sequence will be destroyed and the message is lost forever.

https://teams.igem.org/1932	Therapeutics	Considering solid tumor cells as harmful mutants in the ecosystems in vivo, we propose a novel approach to eliminate tumor cells. Bifidobacterium has been proved to be non-immunogenic to normal cells, and has the ability to preferentially settle in hypoxic regions, including solid tumors. We plan to construct a recombinant plasmid, which consists of DNA replication origins and related genes from pMB-1 and pUC18. In addition, we will clone HU, a Bifidobacterium promoter, and TAT-apoptin gene with a N-terminal secretion signal peptide into this plasmid. As a result, the plasmid can be amplified in both E. coli and Bifidobacterium, and apoptin can be expressed in Bifidobacterium. The Bifidobacterium transformed with this plasmid can settle in the tumor regions, and secret the apoptin protein, which is specifically toxic to tumor cells. With the TAT-mediated membrane crossing, apoptin should be able to enter into solid tumor cells and kill tumor cells.

To overcome this global issue, iGEMKyoto aims to develop an intestinal bioelimination system that can physically remove NoV from the body. In detail, we are creating recombinant E. coli expressing two types of surface-displayed proteins that each specifically bind to NoV and cellulose. By orally administrating this E. coli and cellulose to the patient intestine, this E. coli will bind to NoV, and would swiftly be taken out of the digestive system through its affinity to cellulose, as cellulose passes human intestine undigested. We have already produced the abovementioned E. coli, and confirmed its binding to Norovirus virus-like particles from images of a scanning electron microscopy. We will show further examination of characteristics of this device, such as its binding capability.

STIs are a major concern regarding reproductive health beyond the immediate impact. Initiating early patient care allows a better efficiency of the treatment. Rapid detection and distinction of STIs are therefore a crucial task. To provide a solution, we developed an all-in-one multi-detection device. We chose a recent and promising biotechnology enabling a robust detection of a wide variety of biomarkers. This approach is based on the high specific recognition of aptamers for a particular macromolecule. As a proof of concept, we focus first on the diagnosis of HIV and hepatitis B. By offering a simultaneous test for several diseases, our device has strong potential to improve early home diagnosis. From a body fluid sample, the patient will therefore be able to rapidly assess his health status at a low cost.

In order to understand in which mechanisms this peptide is involved, it will be produced by the bacteria E. coli and then given to the nematode C. elegans. The sleeping process of this nematode will be studied by using both a photo-inductible system and a CRISPR-methylase system called EpiCrispr, which is a modified CRISPR/CAS9 with the purpose of methylating genes participating in this process.

The cave remained stable until its discovery in 1940, which deeply disturbed its ecosystem. It was closed shortly after mainly because of contamination by fungi that cause colored spots on the paintings. Nowadays, mechanical and chemical solutions are daily used and the cave is still in danger due to their limited efficiency. At iGEM Toulouse, we thought about an innovative biological solution based on the last advances in synthetic biology. It consists in an engineered Bacillus subtilis bacterium that develops from bacterial organisms present in the cave. It releases antifungals when in close viscinity of fungi. Since we care about our environment, an inducible riboswitch-based double toxin/antitoxin system was created to prevent DNA transmission and a physical device was designed to confine our strain. “Cave” the date for our presentation!

However, it also poses a large challenge when colonizing our neighbour planet Mars. Martian soil contains 0.5 - 1% perchlorate, which therefore needs to be remediated in order to cultivate edible crops. The Leiden iGEM team will equip the bacterium <i>Escherichia coli</i> with the tools to convert the toxic perchlorate into chloride and oxygen by introducing a set of codon-optimized genes from <i>Dechloromonas aromatica</i>, encoding for the perchlorate reductase complex and chlorite dismutase. Besides this, we will study <i>E. coli</i>’s gene expression under simulated Martian gravity (0.38g) using a Random Positioning Machine, to make sure that our system will function in a bioreactor on Mars. Altogether, our system is widely applicable to remove perchlorate from contaminated soils on earth, while also being useful for future Mars expeditions.

The accuracy of the system will be increased by the synergistic effect of repressor proteins. Combined with reporter gene, a couple of microRNAs will also be used to construct different plasmids to get efficient system which may offer prototype for massive detection accurately and fast in a massive scale.

Designing cells to match researchers' needs exactly has important therapeutic and diagnostic applications. To be able to conveniently harness this technology, new and straightforward tools are required. In light of this, our project aims to develop an innovative CRISPR-dCas9 system in yeasts, capable of regulating genetic transcription and creating robust synthetic circuits. Our model is based around a scaffold guide RNA. This scaffold allows us to recruit transcriptional activators, repressors, and dCas9, as well as direct the complex to a given locus in the genome. In addition, the presence of both activators and repressors in our system would permit a modularity previously unseen in CRISPR-dCas9 based systems. Furthermore, we aspire to improve on Cello, a software that takes a user-given circuit and predicts a plasmid that could recreate it in vivo.
https://teams.igem.org/1942	Therapeutics	Cancers, as the most frightening death threats, are aggressive and malignant. However, a perfect treatment of cancer has not appeared so far. The goal of our project is to develop a strategy to treat cancers, with building a transplantable drug system targeting a specific molecule that functions in cancer. We packed siRNA into exosomes (nano-sized vesicles secreted by human cells) to deliver our drug into certain part of a patient's body. Then we modified our exosome with iRGD to act as integrin-specific targeting tool. Our validation experiments will be carried out at the level of cells and animals to prove both the targeting and silencing function of this drug. Eventually, we expect to see a specific accumulation of the siRNA in the mice’s tumor tissues and the decreased expression of the oncogenes at the transcription level. This project may provide new insights into future treatment of cancer.
https://teams.igem.org/1943	Village	Audiogenetics is a useful tool for high-efficiency cell regulation. Compared to chemical genetics, it stimulates cells with better precision and less toxicity. Furthermore, signals are conveyed to target cells with little delay, leading to a shorter response time. To achieve our goal, membrane mechanosensitive channels (TRPC5 and Piezo) are chosen as receptors. Fluorescent calcium indicator (R-GECO) is employed to indicate cytoplasmic calcium level. Nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) and YFP are used as downstream indicators to quantify the regulatory abilities. Microfluidic channels are also utilized in the pre-study in which shear stress, similar to sound waves, is applied on the cell surface as signal input to explore the basic parameters. A sound generator is constructed to test whether sound can trigger the channels as expected. Additionally, we use directed evolution to improve channels' selectivity for specific sound frequency and their sensitivity to sound of lower intensity.

It uses physicochemical properties of drug molecule and machine learning approaches as decision support system. The activity will improve by using activity fitness function. It is expected that after a certain number of iterations the activity of the drug molecule will improve.

We designed a logic gate in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 to optimize product production. Utilizing the Boolean operator AND, gene expression accommodates the organism’s natural metabolic regulation combined with the quorum sensing mechanism from Vibrio fischeri to create an autoinduction system. With the cost of large scale production in mind, our system eliminates the need for expensive induction molecules, such as IPTG. Under the control of light and a quorum of cells, the T7 promoter, from T7 bacteriophage, drives production of a wide range of products from biofuels to pharmaceuticals. CyanoLogic, coming soon to a lab near you!
https://teams.igem.org/1946	WIKI	Cancer is a complex disease related with uncontrolled proliferation of body cells. Having different types, each type of cancer has its own characteristics on molecular level. Different molecules are produced by cancer cells such as proteins, and secondary metabolites. Because of their specificity, they have been used as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis over past decades. Recently, volatile organic compounds have been identified as biomarker to discriminate the types of cancer. In this project, we plan to construct bacterial whole-cell biosensors for detecting volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to diagnose cancer. Different VOCs will be sensed by different promoter/transcription factor couples, and they will be incorporated into circuits and logic gates operated by CRISPRi system in order to differentiate cancer types effectively based on existence of specific VOCs.
https://teams.igem.org/1947	Foundational Advance	Protein purification is commonly used in Biochemical research, but can become a very tedious and inefficient procedure. We developed a system that can be used to conveniently and efficiently purify recombinant proteins with help of magnetosome. The system consists of two parts. First, we used Escherichia coli to express an interest protein tagged by a Spytag. Second, we generated a Spycatcher-fused Mms13 protein and expressed it in the magetotactic bacteria AMB-1 (Magnetospirillum magneticum). These bacteria synthesize magnetosomes covered by phospholipid bilayer membrane, in which Mms13 is tightly anchored. Spycatcher binds Spytag with high affinity, and thus Spycatcher-Mms13 anchored in magnetosomes can strongly bind Spytag-conjugated protein and specifically bring it down with help of magnetic field. Our system is applicable to efficiently purifying any interest protein for different research purposes.
https://teams.igem.org/1948	Diagnostics	The worldwide Cancer death in the year 2012 was around 8.2 million and,by 2030,13 million deaths are predicted. As per existing records 60% of the rural people in India think that Cancer detection and cure, costs an arm and a leg and is time consuming. MALAT1 (Metastasis Associated Lung Adenocarcinoma Transcript1) is associated with around 15 different types of Cancer. The elevated expression of this gene is correlated with the poor overall survival of the patients. In our project, we strived to develop a minimally invasive Cancer diagnostic chip to enable cost and time efficient detection. The MALAT1 was amplified using E.Coli Plasmids. The chip is equipped with markers to produce fluorescence when encountered with the sample containing MALAT1. Based on its intensity range, particular stage of Cancer can be detected and suitable treatment can be provided. The developed diagnostic chip will revolutionize the so followed Cancer detection techniques.

As of today there are many versions of Snow White. Here in Japan it has the happy ending where Snow White is kissed by her Prince and they live happily ever after. Meanwhile at the end of the common plot the wicked queen is punished fatally for trying to kill Snow White. Our project recreates some Snow White versions with quorum sensing. We plan to think our project from diversified standpoints which we named 3E: Education Econmy and Ethics. We try to build a more complicated circuit and make a substantial contribution to the advancement of Synthetic Biology."
https://teams.igem.org/1950	Food & Nutrition	To innovate a refrigerator without electricity, we invented a prototype of FRAVORATOR that is possible to preserve food by antibacterial volatiles synthesized by Escherichia coli. For high-efficiency synthetic processs, we tried two methods. 1, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate（DXP）synthase, Dxs, is down-regulated when its downstream material has been produced to some extent. So, we tried to over-express, another DXP synthase, nDXP, that rarely has been used in normal conditions. 2, Using genomic editing method, we tried to knock out synthase, that we used to produce unnecessary by product.
https://teams.igem.org/1951	Environment	Platinum is one of the rarest and most valuable metals in the world. Thanks to its physical and chemical properties, it has become pervasive in modern society. One of the main uses of platinum is in cars' catalytic converters, hence important concentrations have been accumulated over time in soils next to roads. Our goal is to recover this platinum as much as possible and obtain nanoparticles, in two steps. The first stage relies on the affinity of Desferrioxamine B, a siderophore, to bind platinum and so favor the further solubilisation of more platinum compounds. Secondly, a modified FliC protein complex will be cloned into E. coli and enable the biosorption of platinum on the flagella of the bacterium.
https://teams.igem.org/1952	Village	Modern waste management facilities are designed to remove human waste products such as ammonia and urea. Biological and chemical concepts are still being used but there is still a significant amount of concentrated nitrogen source is being released into water basins all over the world. Ammonia and urea can be toxic to local marine life and even during its metabolism by microorganisms they deprive water of oxygen which is life-threatening to marine species. We are working on creating a full metabolic pathway in one species to metabolize ammonia and urea into N2 gas which is 70% of our atmosphere. Developing a synthetic pathway in most adaptable bacteria in waste water would allow us to use only one bacterium which is most successful in those conditions as well as adding this pathway into another bacterium which is more suited for waste water treatments throughout the world.
https://teams.igem.org/1953	Environment	Thallium (Tl) is a heavy metal contaminant in the environment and water systems, a concentrated byproduct of mining and industrial applications. Its high toxicity is due to its ability to enter the body through potassium uptake pathways as a potassium analog. Acute exposure to this suspected carcinogen leads to symptoms such as neuropathy and chronic exposure leads to extensive tissue damage. There are few strategies that specifically target thallium for bioremediation in both soil and water systems. Our research focuses on developing a novel thallium uptake system by overexpression of the endogenous Trk protein complex (consisting of trkA, trkE, trkG, and trkH) in E. coli.
https://teams.igem.org/1954	WIKI	Ageing imposes permanent damage to cells in response to various forms of biological stress. The effect of free radicals has emerged as a major factor in molecular ageing of mammalian cells. We are developing a bacterial oxidative stress sensitive probiotic that releases lycopene antioxidant in the presence of oxidative stress in the gut. We are also taking forward a gene therapy approach to boost expression of the enzyme Superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the presence of oxidative stress signals. SOD therapy has the potential to act as a treatment against lung disease and has been proven in some studies to extend healthy lifespan. Hypertension increases rapidly with ageing and we have explored the potential of a antihypertensive dental device consisting of oral bacteria designed to produce nitric oxide precursors in saliva. Nitrite is swallowed and processed to produce Nitric Oxide which causes vascular relaxation, reducing blood pressure.
https://teams.igem.org/1955	Therapeutics	The most commonly used vaccines are in these two main categories, live attenuated and inactivated vaccines. Immunologic adjuvants are required in inactivated vaccines to stimulate an effective immune response. Leishmania is a parasite that lives within the antigen presenting cells (APC). As a potential adjuvant, Leishmania possess many advantages, including APCs recruitment, pattern recognition receptors (PRR) activation and activation of MHC-presenting pathway. Genetically-engineered Leishmania that can be inactivated by light exposure acts as a safe carrier to deliver specific antigens to the APCs for T cells and humoral response. Based on this concept, we established a new model system to generate antigen-specific Leishmania adjuvant--Leijuvant. We further designed a user-friendly MHC peptide prediction software to integrate key protein information and optimize the presentation of antigen peptides by MHC molecules. Our ultimate goal is to introduce Leijuvant as an effective, safe and antigen-specific adjuvant to the vaccine industry and the general public.
https://teams.igem.org/1956	Measurement	We have made an efficient measurement device to help iGEMers characterize their protein production modules, promoter and RBS parts, precisely. This device has enabled us to screen noisy dual protein production modules. In order to understand the modularity of RBS parts, we have validated an empirical model to predict protein expression levels using available expression data in literature. Also, we have designed RNA Inducible Boolean Output Switch (RIBOS) devices to turn on/off the translation of protein coding mRNA, downstream of switch RNA, via trigger RNA molecules. Modelling results have shown RIBOS to be highly orthogonal. As an application, we are making a non-invasive gene containment device with the help of RIBOS and CRISPR/Cas9 technology.
https://teams.igem.org/1957	Energy	Given a wide range of global challenges to traditional energy sources, including from climate change, renewable energy production must proliferate. However, intermittency limits economic viability of these systems; issues like 'peaking' of energy production are costly to mitigate. To overcome this, we are experimenting with Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, which possesses the MtrCAB 'molecular nanowire' complex. Using this system, electrons can channel into the cell and to hydrogenase enzymes that reduce protons to diatomic hydrogen, storing electrical energy as chemical energy within H2. The natural process yields low amounts of H2 and is not currently economically scalable. BioWire intends to increase H2 yields using a single vector that will express recombinant hydrogenase genes. Western blotting and gas chromatography will quantify protein expression levels and H2 yields, respectively. Thus, we hope to demonstrate the viability of S. oneidensis MR-1 to generate economically viable forms of energy as diatomic hydrogen.
https://teams.igem.org/1958	Energy	The current world is undergoing a global energy change. Among all possible substitutes for fossil fuels, hydrogen serves as a praising future energy form. In this year’s iGEM competition, our team intended to harness solar energy to drive whole-cell hydrogen production in air conditions. We constructed a recombinant strain of Escherichia coli over expressing the indigenous [Ni-Fe] hydrogenase Hyd1 and relevant maturases. Energy of photons are transformed to excited electrons by semiconductors such as TiO2, and methyl vionlogen transports the electron to the biocatalyst. Noting that hydrogenases are commonly sensitive to oxygen, we constructed special silica encapsulation forming an anaerobic environment within bacteria cell clusters to avoid oxidative damage. The combination of biocatalyst, semiconductors and silica then leads to in air light-driven hydrogen production. This project sparks new light onto chemical-biological hybrid methods in the development of new energy forms.
https://teams.igem.org/1959	New Application	Astaxanthin is a naturally-occurring keto-carotenoid found in microalgae, salmon, shrimp, crustaceans, and the feathers of some birds. It provides the red color of salmon meat and cooked shellfish.Because astaxanthin is a powerful antioxidant with great value in medical and health care,it is meaningful to make astaxanthin an accessible health product.Currently, the industrial ways to produce astaxanthin are extract from microalgae Haematococcus pluvialis,Phaffia yeast,shrimp processing waste and chemical product.However these ways aren’t safety enough and the purification is difficult. While higher plants are supposed to be an efficient and safe bioreactor to produce astaxanthin,because it has advanced protein processing system to produce complex product.So we think about using higher plant to produce astaxanthin.In our project,we take rice endosperm as the bioreactor of astaxanthin production,and use a technique called multiple-gene metabolic engineering to specifically express astaxanthin in rice endosperm. In this way, rice endosperm can produce and store astaxanthin.
https://teams.igem.org/1960	Diagnostics	For many years, overusing of antibiotics results in antibiotic resistance of many bacteria. Focusing on this, our team uses the way of synthetic biology to detect and kill the drug-resistant bacteria. In the project one,we designed a self-regulated gene circuit, which can detect and kill both the Gram-positive and the Gram-negative. It can express different fluorescent proteins when the engineering bacteria encounter differnet types of pathogenic bacteria.Then toxins are released out of the cell to kill the targets. We found that the pre-loading of the drug and the systemic inflammatory response are the barriers in most drug delivery strategies. So in the project two,we designed a pulsatile delivery cycles called SSLC"( Synthetically Synchronized Lysis Circuit) based on the "SLC" (Synchronized Lysis Circuit) systems designed by M.Omar.Din in 2016. this system can become a therapeutic strategy for antibiotic resistance E.coli.

Although there are a few methods (for example: ICP-MS) to detect these harmful substances, the procedures often turn out to be expensive and inconvenient to most people. If the danger in herbs continues to cast shadows among people, it is only a matter of time that people stop eating Chinese Medicine and soon this important Chinese culture might be gone forever. Thus, we decide to create a series of cheap, user-friendly E. coli biosensor. When the bacteria detect certain poison in the medicine, they will produce fluorescence protein. That way, we can detect the poison inside the Chinese Medicine by just examining the fluorescence intensity. With this new design and aspect, we hope to see people regaining hope in this tradition, yet, this distinctive culture.
https://teams.igem.org/1962	Food & Nutrition	Antimicrobial resistance will kill between 14 million and 444 million people by 2050, according to the World Health Organisation. Antibiotics are used extensively in livestock to combat infection; this is a massive contributor to the growing problem of antibacterial resistance. An alternative treatment for livestock is needed if we are to preserve antibiotics for medicinal use. To combat this, we are Fighting Bacterial Infections by modifying bacteriocins through introducing novel toxic domains. We are engineering non-pathogenic E. coli to produce bacteriocins in response to conditions in the GI tract that will kill pathogenic strains of E. coli and similar bacteria such as Salmonella. We believe our GM bacteria can be used in an animal feed, a ‘BactiFeed’, to tackle common bacterial infections in livestock, decrease unnecessary antibiotic usage and reduce the development of bacterial resistance.
https://teams.igem.org/1963	Village	Welcome to Scotland’s first ever high school iGEM team! For our project we plan to assign our agent spiRNA on a mission to target Vibrio Cholerae and Shigella Flexneri: two pathogens that cause fatal diarrhoeal diseases in developing countries. To achieve this, we’ve created a fusion protein which will allow our spiRNA to hitch a ride out of E. coli. Then the agent will sneak its way into the target pathogen and complete its mission by preventing the pathogen from causing an infection. We’re targeting Cholera and Shigella specifically because they are both a major cause of death in developing countries, this is because treatments are not readily available and are often expensive. Therefore, we hope our spiRNA is a cheaper alternative to current treatments that will hopefully be readily available to a larger number of infected people and in other words FIGHT BACTERIAL INFECTIONS.
https://teams.igem.org/1964	New Application	Globalization radically changed the world we live in; the way we communicate and travel has become much easier. On the downside, our need for resources has dramatically increased causing ecological and social problems like land-grabbing and fracking. The emergence of Synthetic Biology is initiating another bio-based industrial revolution. It is time to take the next step towards a sustainable bio-industry. In 'Syndustry', we follow nature’s own design principles by combining the strengths of individual microorganisms for the production of valuable biochemicals. We introduce a novel ‘plug-and-play’ production platform based on artificial endosymbiosis. This system goes beyond co-culturing microbes and overcomes current production limitations in fermentation. By employing cyanobacteria, capable of photosynthetic growth, we achieve a self-sustainable and versatile production platform for biochemicals from carbon dioxide. 'Syndustry – fuse. produce. use.' is the next industrial revolution and will change the face of the world as we know it today!
https://teams.igem.org/1965	WIKI	Synthetic biology opens exciting perspectives to design and apply regulatory circuits to control cellular response. Transcriptional regulation may be too slow for therapeutic or diagnostic applications. Several medical doctors and researchers that we consulted stressed the wish for a faster response. Therefore we decided to select as the challenge to design faster responsive cellular circuits. The system we aim to design is composed of the sensing module, which may be triggered by selected molecules, light or other signals; a processing module, which combines different inputs based on protein modifications and interactions and an output module, to provide rapid release of the selected proteins from cells, with a target specification to achieve a response within minutes rather than within hours and days, characteristic for current mammalian cell circuits. We expect that the proof of principle of the designed system and newly designed components may provide important foundational advances for synthetic biology.
https://teams.igem.org/1966	Manufacturing	Aromatic aldehydes have a wide range of useful applications, from flavors and fragrances to pharmaceutical precursors and plastic additives. A large majority of these aldehydes are produced at low yield and over toxic catalysts. This gives rise to the need to produce these molecules in a renewable, environmentally friendly, and high-yield manner. Our project aims to meet these goals by developing a synthetic biology route to generate a library of aromatic aldehydes from their respective inexpensive toluene-based precursors that are an environmentally toxic waste in crude oil processing. We utilize the xyl ortho pathway of Pseudomonas putida, which is cloned into Escherichia coli as a host platform. This pathway converts toluene derivatives with a wide range of functional groups in the meta and para positions on the ring to their corresponding aromatic aldehydes, leaving the meta and para substituents unaltered and therefore allowing for development of a library of products.
https://teams.igem.org/1967	Information Processing	In 2014, over 10 sextillion bits of data were digitally stored worldwide. To put this in context, there are only 1 sextillion grains of sand on this entire Earth. According to IBM, we generate over 2.5 billion gigabytes daily through tweets, emails and Facebook posts! The University of Edinburgh’s undergraduate team has designed a DNA storage system that is a sustainable, dense and long-lasting alternative to magnetic tape data storage. The storage system relies on modular DNA fragments that can flexibly and cost effectively store any type of data. Modularity makes BabblED the cheapest and most accessible DNA storage system available. The system is also the first ever DNA data storage technique to incorporate error-correcting and encryption systems. In fact, their ‘DNA Typewriter’ has already been implemented by the National Library of Scotland to archive one of their most precious manuscripts: the last letter of Mary Queen of Scots.
https://teams.igem.org/1968	New Application	Industrial biotechnology is greatly dependent on the use of model organisms such as Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The minimal cell is a future ambition of synthetic biology however there remains a vast untapped reservoir of non-model organisms, each with diverse and unique traits for exploitation. It is a lack of tools designed for native producer organisms that often limits use as effective bio-factories. Today, advance genetic engineering techniques such as CRISPR/Cas editing and MoClo assembly methods allow rapid strain prototyping at unprecedented ease and cost. Our team aim to demonstrate the potential, speed and power of these techniques in developing three diverse platform strains and respective parts libraries for use by research groups, iGEM teams, commercial organisations and citizen scientists.
https://teams.igem.org/1969	Diagnostics	Although our medicine filed has witnessed great progress in the past few decades, most people are still less motivated to attend a physical examination, which is critically important for the early diagnosis of various disease. Privacy, convenience and expense are the leading considerations in deciding to set off for a test. So it’s extremely promising to establish an easy-to-use and real-time device which renders carrying out physical examinations domestically possible. Yeast is ideal as a candidate biosensor for it can serve as a chassis for higher-eukaryotic sensing modalities (e.g. G-protein-coupled receptors, GPCRs) which means it can be engineered to monitor diverse disease biomarkers, more importantly, it can be made in ‘active dry’ form cheaply and stored for long periods of time so that people can store it in a refrigerator at home. Our team engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae to detect the level of disease biomarkers and made diagnostic suggestions.
https://teams.igem.org/1970	Village	Implementing logic gates in living cells poses an interesting challenge in synthetic biology. Logic gates are the building blocks of digital electrical circuits, allowing rational, modular design of complex functions. Successful implementations of equivalent systems in living cells would open up new possibilities for regulation and manipulation of cell metabolism. This project will implement a biological XOR gate by exploiting a naturally occurring type of DNA called DNA ribozymes. These single stranded DNA sequences are able to bind to and cut sequence specific RNA sequences, almost like restriction enzymes for RNA. Combining DNA ribozymes with silencing of reporter gene expression will allow us to design a system which responds to inducer signals in an XOR-gate like fashion inside living cells. The XOR gate is perhaps the most challenging logic gate to recreate biologically, and a successful proof of concept would pave the way for similar implementations of other logic gates.

https://teams.igem.org/1972	Environment	As we know, the consumption of oil——one of the most important fuels in the world, has caused many serious environmental issues including acid rain, which has caused serious damage to the buildings, plants, and animals and so on, mainly due to the sulfur element contained in the oil. To reduce the destruction of sulfur, many traditional desulfurization methods have been studied and applied on industrial desulfurization, such as Oxidative desulfurization and hydrodesulfurization. But these methods have many shortcomings such as the poisonous gas products and high cost at energy. To compensate for weakness in the traditional desulfurization, we decide to adopt the biodesulfurization method, which is far more environmental and energy-saving. In order to meet our expectation, we are devoting to highly effective biodesulfurization through 4s-pathway by using engineering bacteria.
https://teams.igem.org/1973	Environment	Pseudomonas putida is a soil bacterium capable of surface attachment and aggregation to form biofilms. Biofilms are excellent catalysts of biotechnological processes, as they are more efficient, robust and resistant than bacteria in suspension. Glycerol is a byproduct from the biodiesel industry that has become a preferred substrate for industrial fermentations. The purpose of this project is to generate a platform P. putida strain to catalyze biofilm-based conversion of glycerol to interesting end-products. To this end, we intend to genetically manipulate P. putida to incorporate a synthetic genetic switch that will allow us to reprogram bacteria either to induce robust biofilm formation appropriate for biocatalysis, or biofilm dispersal to allow easy recycling of the substrate materials of the reactor. On the other hand, we will use in silico predictions to rationally modify carbon assimilation and metabolism to obtain conversion of glycerol into products of potential biotechnological use.

The spider-venom peptides have toxicity against insect species including Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies), Diptera (flies and mosquitoes), and Coleoptera (beetles). In our project, engineered Escherichia coli expresses “PANTIDE family” including ω-hexatoxin-hv1a, μ2-segestritoxin-sf1a, and Orally Active Insecticidal Peptide (OAIP). To improve the oral activity, we fuse spider-venom peptides with snowdrop (Galanthus nivalis L.) lectin. The fusion peptides can be sprayed on crops and eliminate targeted pests by oral administration. The PANTIDE family is eco-friendly, bio-degradable and safe to mammals compared with conventional pesticide. Besides, a new agricultural system based on Internet of Things (IoT) technology has been designed using three parts: detector, sprinkler, and client. With the automatic system, farm owners can monitor the status in farmland and safeguard the ecological equilibrium remotely from the application in smartphones.
https://teams.igem.org/1975	Village	Space missions face the problems that transporting mass is expensive and the needs of long expeditions are unknown in advance. It would be revolutionary to have the capacity to manufacture various resources needed without prior knowledge of exact mission requirements. We have designed a modular co-culture system to accomplish this: containing the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus to use CO2 and light, which are plentiful on Mars, to produce sucrose. This is used as a common feedstock by Bacillus subtilis to generate essential end-products. We used polylactic acid as a proof-of-concept, since 3D printers can use it for tools and machine parts. To examine the co-culture’s practicality in extraterrestrial environments, the cutting-edge Jens Martin Mars Chamber was used to test stresses including UV exposure and pressure extremes. We propose that Bacillus’s sporulation ability will enable missions to maintain libraries of strains for constructing a versatile array of materials for future space exploration.
https://teams.igem.org/1976	Foundational Advance	As the field of synthetic biology increases and becomes more present in the everyday live the topic of bio safety becomes more important likewise. However, there are no functional safety approaches available from previous years that the teams could easily choose and apply on their current projects. To this end, we want to generate a safety approach to enable all iGEM Teams to work safely with E.coli. A genetic circuit is integrated into the E.coli genome ensuring that genetically modified E.coli cannot survive outside of the required conditions. This genetic circuit is based on the availability of an unnatural amino acid (UAA) which continuously has to be added to the medium. A reporter protein is expressed as the level of UAA in the medium decreases, signalizing the low UAA concentration. If the level decreases further, the expression of colicin is induced, resulting in the death of the bacteria.
https://teams.igem.org/1977	Village	Aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is an endogenous non-protein amino acid that is as an intermediate in many pathways including Heme, Vitamin B12, chlorophyll and others. ALA has a range of applications including: Medical - tumour-localiser, cancer photodynamic therapy and drug delivery Agricultural - bioherbicide, plant growth regulator and insecticide. Current ALA production uses a chemical synthesis method which is highly energy demanding producing a low yield at a high cost. The aim of our project is to biosynthesise ALA by up-regulating and down-regulating certain enzymes in the heme biosynthesis (C5) pathway, this will not only increase the yield of ALA but to also decrease the energy required during the synthesis of the product. By metabolic engineering of E. coli we hope to optimise the production of ALA increasing the sustainability and the economical gain when synthesising the product.
https://teams.igem.org/1978	Food & Nutrition	Vitamin B12 is involved in metabolic functions in all organisms and is an essential nutrient. It is for example a compound in vitamin pills and needed for production of various organic substances. Since the chemical production of Vitamin B12 requires 70 synthesis steps, the production technically challenging and expensive. B12 production is facilitated by engineered bacterial production strains, which achieve a high product quality. However, the produced Vitamin B12 is not exported by the production organism and is harvested by cell lysis. This prevents a cost efficient production. To date, a natural cellular Vitamin B12 exporter is unknown. We intend to design, construct and introduce a synthetic Vitamin B12 exporter into a production organism. By establishing a Vitamin B12 exporter, we aim for higher yields in the industrial Vitamin B12 production without lysing the cells. Furthermore, the production efficiency of Vitamin B12 production strains should be increased.
https://teams.igem.org/1979	High School	Our project aims at speeding up while lowering the cost of antibiotic detecting methods for milk. We take β-lactams as the target, and implement a penicillin binding protein, which recognizes all β-lactams, in our testing device. First, we improve the ELISA method with a competitive binding reaction, in which the penicillin (or other β-lactams) on the plate and in the testing sample compete to bind with GFP-PBP5(penicillin binding protein 5). We can then measure the concentration of penicillin by measuring the fluorescence intensity on the plate. To even further reduce the cost and strengthen the sensitivity of the test, we create a test paper by binding our fusion protein CBD (cellulose binding domain)-PBP5 to filter paper. When the paper is dipped in milk, the presence of β-lactams alters PBP5’s enzymatic activity, and we measure it by electric conductivity test, which indicates the concentration of β-lactams in this sample.
https://teams.igem.org/1980	Therapeutics	Wilson’s disease is a genetic disorder in which the body is unable to fully metabolise copper. This results in copper accumulation, causing liver and brain damage if untreated. Patients describe current treatments as unsatisfactory due to their costliness, side effects, and dosage frequency. We hope to show that E. coli engineered to express copper chelators originating from M. trichosporium and Mycobacterium spp. reduces copper ion concentration in vitro. This has applications as a potential probiotic treatment for Wilson’s disease, without the limitations of current treatments. We propose an encapsulation system that protects bacteria from simulated stomach conditions and may serve as a mechanism to deliver the probiotic to the small intestine, the site of copper absorption.
https://teams.igem.org/1981	New Application	Autoinducer-2 (AI-2) is a signaling molecule that plays a crucial role in Quorum Sensing (QS), a process that mediates inter- and intra-species bacterial communication resulting in coordinated multicellular behavior. Drawing inspiration from the effect of AI-2 QS system on collective behavior and cellular decision-making, our team aims to engineer bacteria via synthetic biology approaches to control AI-2 level in natural and artificial environment. We have mainly designed two cell machines: ‘AI-2 Supplier’ is a cell machine which can directly supply high level of AI-2 molecules in the bacteria community while ‘AI-2 Consumer’ is a cell machine which can sense, absorb and degrade the AI-2 molecules in the environment. By taking advantage of the special characteristics of ‘AI-2 Controllers’, we hope to directly control the inter- and intra-species collective behaviors of bacteria in group level.

In this work, we aim to develop a light inducible CRISPR/Cas9 system in prokaryotic and lower eukaryotic cells, to precisely manipulate target gene activation upon the light induction. We fused two light-activated plant proteins, CRY2 or CIB1, to a transcriptional activator VP64 or the  catalytic domain deleted tCas9, generating CRY2-VP64 or CIB1-tCas9 chimeric constructs. In the presence of a specific gRNA guide, the tCas9 domain from CIB1-tCas9 binds to the promoter of a reporter gene. Once exposing to blue light, the CRY2 domain from CRY2-VP64 can form a protein complex with CIB1-tCas9, which in turn brings the VP64 domain to the chromatin and activates the reporter gene. We also plan to examine multiple light-sensitive elements, including LOV(light-oxygen-voltage-sensing domain) and Phy(phytochromoes), in order to provide various gene manipulation systems and to compare their efficiencies for gene activation.
https://teams.igem.org/1983	WIKI	Phenylketonuria is a genetically inherited condition which is defined by the inability of a patient to break down an essential amino acid phenylalanine. Due to that, phenylalanine derivatives accumulate in the brain of a patient causing severe mental retardation. The aim of our team is to construct a bacterial probiotic with an enhanced rate of phenylalanine uptake and two independent systems for discharging phenylalanine. The first system will metabolize phenylalanine directly in the intestinal tract with phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) whilst the second system will incorporate excess phenylalanine into inclusion bodies made of synthetic phenylalnine-rich proteins. The production of these proteins is controlled by a postranscriptional regulator - a riboswitch, which is sensitive to phenylalanine. The final stage of the project will include verification of the system in a bacterial probiotic strain.
https://teams.igem.org/1984	New Application	We are now at a moment in history where life can be designed and created. As we move towards a global society, this shift in understanding will come to play a dramatic role in how we shape the future. Throughout Earth's past, life has been guided by evolution. It has lead to the domains Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya, all constituting the Tree of Life. This pivotal moment may require an addition; a domain of synthetically created life, The Synthetic Kingdom. Our project examines the roles of Synthetic Biology, looking at technology, society, medicine and industry. We investigate the improvement of anti-malarial production, and the gene editing tool CRISPR-CPF1. As we face problems such as disease, conservation and pollution, this new domain will undoubtedly revolutionize the world as we know it.
https://teams.igem.org/1985	WIKI	Bacteria such as Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense grow magnetite nano-crystals that they use for orientation. These magnetic nanoparticles are grown from iron inside of organelle-like structures called magnetosomes. In this project, we will produce magnetite nanoparticles using a synthetic biology approach utilising enzymes involved in magnetosome formation. We will utilise proteins MamP, MamT and MamX, which were chosen due to their proposed involvement in promoting magnetite crystal maturation in M. gryphiswaldense. Each of the genes will be incorporated both separately and as a set into E. coli with the aim of producing magnetite crystals in vivo in the cells. The proteins will also be purified and tested in vitro. Our results will further our understanding of how bacteria cells are able to form and organise magnetite nanoparticles in magnetosomes, and demonstrate how synthetic biology approach can be used to make nano-materials.
https://teams.igem.org/1986	Energy	The problematic of fossil fuels has been widely known for many years, it is not only difficult to sustain the needed production, but there is a considerable amount of waste and gases freed to the environment during its use and fabrication. In many countries, the biofuels are being developed as an alternative to the conventional fuels, which brings many benefits like diminishing the Greenhouse Effect Gases, that keep affecting the earth atmosphere. In Pumas Synbio, this problematic is addressed by the genetic modification of the seaweed Chlorella vulgaris, with the objective to optimize the lipid production and facilitate collecting them without needing to sacrifice the biomass. The advantages are multiple, some examples might include that the production costs and time inversion is lower, the seaweeds can adapt and reproduce in any available space and scale, which makes it an efficient and cheap option to normal fuels.
https://teams.igem.org/1987	Foundational Advance	Most promoters in the iGEM registry can be separated into two categories. There are constitutive, or “always on,” promoters of various strengths. There are also inducible promoters, which activate transcription based on environmental factors such as light, pH, or the presence of certain molecules. UIUC_Illinois is characterizing a promoter library that gives more control over gene expression, without the need for inducers. We are isolating a set of e. coli promoters that turn on and off according to the host’s growth phase. For example, one promoter may become active during exponential growth but shut off as growth slows. Another promoter may exhibit little to no activity until stationary phase has been reached. These promoters will be useful tools for any teams wishing to time protein production in vivo, for applications such as metabolic engineering, probiotics, or more.
https://teams.igem.org/1988	Environment	Water phosphate concentrations greater than 25 µg/L are known to drive the growth of harmful algal blooms, which compromise water quality and cost global industry more than ten billion USD in damage annually. To improve phosphate management, we transformed genes putatively responsible for inorganic phosphate transport and polyphosphate synthesis from the polyphosphate-accumulating organism (PAO) Microlunatus phosphovorus into E. coli and characterized their functions. Concurrently, we designed and built a suite of cost-effective phosphorus reclamation modules (PRMs) around xerogel-immobilized cells for contained, multipoint phosphate bioremediation. With continued testing, we expect to see an increased dry-mass percentage of phosphorus in our chassis relative to unmodified E. coli, elucidate cell viability and function within our xerogels, and understand the effective lifespan of our constructs. Through genetic, chemical, and mechanical engineering, we provide a means for preventing harmful algal blooms in both developed and developing countries.
https://teams.igem.org/1989	Environment	Uranium, a well-known radioactive metal, exhibits both chemical toxicity and radioactive hazards to environment and humans. Nowadays, several common methods are adopted to cope with uranium pollution, such as solidification of poluted soil and phytoremediation. Nevertheless, these methods are flawed owing to high cost, lengthy procedures as well as potential secondary contamination. To overcome the drawbacks of traditional methods, Peking iGEM team focus on constructing a novel multi-functional biological material which is able to absorb uranyl ion fleetly with high specificity and affinity. This uranyl-absorbing material can be synthesized and secreted continuously by bacteria, self-assembled in extracellular environment, and harvested in a cost-effective manner. It also has a great potential to be modified and expanded due to its modular design. With this material, we demonstrate how the increasingly serious uranium pollution can be treated in a more efficient and sustainable way in the near future.
https://teams.igem.org/1990	Food & Nutrition	Vibrio harveyi is a bacterium pathogenic to marine species and with no specific cure for infected organisms. For instance, shrimp aquaculture all over the world is greatly affected by Vibriosis. In order to combat this pathogen, we can engineer E. coli—which utilizes a common auto-inducer AI-2 between itself and Vibrio harveyi—to monitor the Vibrio harveyi population through the quorum sensing pathway as well as designing a system for the manufacture of Nitric Oxide (NO)-a compound known to have certain antimicrobial effects. Upon detection of AI-2, the engineered E. coli can thereupon express bsNOS gene-one coding for a Nitric Oxide Synthase protein in Bacillus subtilis. Through the expression of this system, NO may be produced to act against the pathogen.
https://teams.igem.org/1991	High School	The testing method used these days seems to contain a few problems and wasn’t that reliable to the public. Therefore, we started to aim at finding a better way to conduct the alcohol test. We did lots of research about how alcohol tests work and tried to find out the way alcohol reacts with the proteins and chemicals in our bodies or other organisms. We came up with the idea of imitating the mechanism that blood glucose meters equipped. We decided to oxidize alcohol and produce hydrogen peroxide to cause exchanging of electrons then detect it by blood glucose meters. Our bacteria will produce alcohol oxidase and display it on the cell surface, and we will remove the glucose oxidase in a blood glucose meter and replace it with alcohol oxidase. Voila! A portable and accurate blood alcohol meter was created.
https://teams.igem.org/1992	Foundational Advance	Chemotaxis is the movement of bacteria in response to chemical stimuli. This process is mediated by chemoreceptors – membrane proteins that bind to substances with high specificity depending on their ligand binding domain (LBD). FlashLab offers a set of tools for harnessing the bacterial chemotaxis system. By replacing the LBD of the E. coli Tar-chemoreceptor with various LBDs, or by inserting a switchable lock and key mechanism into the receptor, chemotaxis can be programmed to respond to a substance of our choice. As an implementation of our system we introduce a novel method for detecting an array of materials, such as pollutants, hormones and allergens. The engineered bacteria are confined to a microfluidics chip; the user simply inserts a sample into the chip and if the matching substance exists, the cells will either move towards or away from the sample forming a visible cluster.
https://teams.igem.org/1993	Therapeutics	With great power to suppress adaptive immune system as well as innate immune system, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are promising candidates for cell-based therapy to treat inflammatory diseases, such as IBD, encephalitis, etc. However, clinical trials of MSCs have demonstrated that only a few MSCs can indeed arrive at the inflamed tissue after systematic administration and exert their immunomodulatory function due to the inefficient homing ability of MSCs. This year, MSCs of next generation are coming. In our project, we will 1) Empower MSCs with a series of chemokine receptors in order to ensure its effective homing. 2) Introduce several kinds of positioning system, such as luciferase to locate in vivo MSC and assure their arrival at the inflamed tissue. 3) Design a switch to kill MSCs when they differentiate into other types of cells. Finally, we will confirm our engineered MSCs in animal models, such as IBD and DTH.
https://teams.igem.org/1994	WIKI	By providing fast and cheap diagnosis, the socio-economic impacts of disease can be reduced on a global scale. We aim to build an RNA based detection system utilising CRISPR/Cas9 technology, specifically targeting infectious agents. Using a dCas9 protein and an RNA-binding protein (RBP) fused to an effector, transcription of a fluorescent reporter gene can be regulated, with a significant colour change indicating the presence of targeted RNA. This is due to the conformational change that occurs within the gRNA strand when the targeted foreign RNA is recognised and binds. As a proof of principle, the sensor will be modified to detect two bacterial diseases: Lyme disease and Leptospirosis, and potentially two heavy metal pollutants: mercury and lead. The modularity of the system should allow simple modification to change sensor-specificity. Bacterial lysates will be detected by reconstituting the detection machinery in a low-cost in vitro transcription kit, including a paper-based support.
https://teams.igem.org/1995	Environment	Nowadays, heavy metals in the water have become a threat to fish and human consumers. Current methods including physical-chemical remediation, phytoremediation and others are limited to deal with heavy metal pollution. We proposed a new approach named gut remediation to reduce bioaccumulated heavy metals in fish by gut microbiota. We designed a polypeptide which can bind to heavy metals including mercury and copper. Then a novel gene Metal Catcher was designed based on the polypeptide with GFP and N-terminal region of INP. Subsequent display of Metal Catcher on the E. coli surface showed highly sensitivity and selectivity of copper, mercury and cadmium, and permitted selective adsorption of copper, mercury. Then, we fed cyprinoid fish with the transformant strains. Result showed that experiment group have lower accumulation of heavy metals compared to the control. Therefore, gut remediation is an ideal approach to control heavy metal contaminations in fish.
https://teams.igem.org/1996	Village	According to Avocados Australia, the majority of damage to avocados occurs at the store level from people squeezing the fruit to test for ripeness. However, this sort of damage is not just isolated to avocados; so how else can we confidently predict the ripeness of fruit before buying it? iGEM USYD 2016 introduces FRES(H): a sticker that can “sense” the ripening hormone ethylene being produced by a piece of fruit. The sticker is a cell-based biosensor containing E. coli that express two Mycobacteria proteins. The first, a protein kinase, detects ethylene and phosphorylates the second protein, a response regulator. This interaction causes transcription of a chromoprotein, producing a bright blue colour. Through calibrating the sensitivity of the system, a whole range of ethylene levels can be detected, empowering fruit lovers with the knowledge they will be eating the freshest fruit every time.
https://teams.igem.org/1997	New Application	MicroRNAs, serve as critical gene expression regulators at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, have also been found as important blood-based biomarkers for early detection of cancers. However, their current in vitro detection methods are relatively complex, costly and low sensitive. Our project attempts to establish a novel in vitro microRNA detection system which is rapid, efficient, sensitive and specific. In this system, CRISPR-Cas9 technique is modified to integrate with split-luciferase or split-HRP reporting systems. The advanced rolling circle amplification technology and cell-free expression system are also involved and optimized. This system may ideally be compatible for the detection of various series of small non-coding RNAs. To our knowledge, we are the first to use the CRISPR-Cas9 system as a small non-coding RNA monitor in vitro. Its establishment and further development might provide a new approach for rapid and low-cost cancer screening, virus detection and curative efficacy assessment.
https://teams.igem.org/1998	Village	The hydrogen generation industry produces over 50 million tons of hydrogen per year, sourcing over 95% of its product from fossil fuels. Our overall goal is to engineer photosynthesis into E.coli to producing hydrogen from sunlight. Our first goal is to engineer the chlorophyll biosynthesis pathway into E.coli. Production of chlorophyll in non-photosynthetic organisms has not yet been successful. Secondly we will synthetically construct 17 genes of Photosystem II into E.coli to generate oxygen and electrons via the oxidation of water molecules. Lastly, the electrons generated from Photosystem II will be converted to hydrogen gas using hydrogenase. This will enable the production of hydrogen gas in a clean and sustainable way which could be used as a future energy source. Our modelling and human practice approaches will allow an assessment on the viability of the production of hydrogen on an industrial scale.
https://teams.igem.org/1999	High School	Due to the increasing amount of plastic trashed, scientists are keeping their eyes on several ways to confront this environmental issue. One rising solution is the Meal-worm". They can maintain their lives through consuming Styrofoam due to the microorganism in their guts that degrade the Styrofoam. A PS-degrading bacterial strain is called the Exiguobacterium sp. strain YT2. However the big problem of the meal-worms is that they are not able to dissolve PET. Thus we will insert the gene of this bacteria into E.coli by using the gene synthesis. Then we will test the PET disintegration ability of meal-worms after feeding them the modified E.coli. Our hypothesis is that meal-worms will actively disintegrate PET after consuming the altered E.coli. "

KLF4（Kruppel-like-factor 4）is a ES plouripotency factor which is able to bi-directionally regulate genes and playing an essential role in somatic reprogramming" within the process of tumorigenesis.

https://teams.igem.org/2001	Software	Our project aims at designing a powerful and convenient tool for synthetic biologists to assist their research. It is web based and has a plugin system. As a web based software, it can be used on any platform and operating systems. Besides, since it's a plugin system, all of its functions are implemented as plugins, which makes it easy to be expanded. Any developer can design his or her own plugins and insert them into our software. This year, we will accomplish the whole framework and achieve the following features. 1. Provide guidance for experiments from simulation. 2. Automatically seek for pathways. 3. In-time edit of genetic circuits. 4. Data visualization. 5. A key to retrieve the major databases. 6. Cooperating and sharing based on account system. 7. Automatically search for relationship between genes from papers. ...
https://teams.igem.org/2002	Therapeutics	Lactococcus lactis, a generally recognised as safe (GRAS) bacterium commonly used in food production, is highly amenable to genetic manipulation. We aim to develop a synthetic L. lactis-based platform that can deliver proteins to immune cells to precisely influence the host immune response for use in the treatment of various diseases. Potential applications which we have investigated include vaccination strategies and macrophage modification. We have developed the platform as a vaccine against leishmaniasis, a neglected tropical disease increasing in geographical distribution. LJM11 is an immunogenic salivary protein of the sandfly vector, Lutzomyia longipalpis. Our inexpensive platform, through simple oral administration, has the capacity to deliver this protein to antigen-presenting cells, and potentially immunise against the life cycle of leishmaniasis. Besides vaccination strategies, this platform may be employed to modify the phenotype of other phagocytic cells associated with diseases such as cancer.
https://teams.igem.org/2003	Hardware	Microfluidics already allows us to scale down a wide range of experiments, streamlining and lowering their cost. Creating microfluidic chips can however be very expensive, since certain expertise and special equipment are required. Our goal was to develop a method of making microfluidics more available to iGEM teams and researchers, while also creating tools that could be combined with these chips. By 3D-printing the molds for the chips we were able to produce cheap, high resolution devices capable of transforming E.coli more efficiently than standard protocols for transformation. We also characterised and added to the registry the recently discovered CRISPR associated protein CPF1 as well as the fluorescent protein UnaG. As CPF1 has been shown to be more effective than CAS9 in certain aspects, and UnaG being half the size of GFP, we thought these proteins would greatly assist future iGEM teams, especially in combination with microfluidics!
https://teams.igem.org/2004	Village	Taurine is a pseudo-aminoacid derivative of cysteine which can be obtained naturally by some foods, biosynthesized by some organisms or produced through a series of chemical reactions. Taurine synthesis is an important process as it plays many roles in the functions on the human body, among other organisms. The main aim of our project is to successfully introduce a couple of enzymes into E. coli’s genome so it can biosynthesize this important molecule. To achieve this, these two taurine-pathway enzymes were selected: cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase (CSAD) and cysteine dioxygenase (COD). It is important to highlight the fact that it’s the first time we synthesize both of them using synthetic biology techniques.
https://teams.igem.org/2005	Foundational Advance	The time has come for synthetic biology to free itself from the constraints of evolution. As an engineering discipline, synthetic biology depends on its genetically-encoded parts operating in consistent and predictable ways. Yet mutation and evolution break that predictability, altering the system’s behavior in disruptive or even dangerous ways, and selecting against intended transgene function. As long as evolution and mutation are allowed to proceed unchecked, the long-term stability, effectiveness, and safety of any genetic technology are at risk. Our solution began by characterizing a set of mutation-prone “hotspot” nucleotide sequences, which we then applied to create new algorithmic tools for modulating any gene’s susceptibility to mutation without affecting its function. With these tools we have achieved precise and predictable control over the frequency of mutation. Through rational design principles, our works shows that it is possible to counteract even the seemingly inescapable forces of evolution. Score one for engineering.

https://teams.igem.org/2007	Energy	Biodiesel is mainly composed of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) and is a renewable energy source. Currently FAMEs are synthesized through transesterification of free fatty acids (FFAs) using a methyl donor, such as methanol, along with an alkaline catalyst to speed up the reaction. Both the extraction of FFAs and the chemicals used in this process are expensive. We intend to reduce the production cost of biodiesel by producing FAMEs in vivo using an insect methyltransferase called Drosophila melanogaster Juvenile hormone acid O-methyltransferase (DmJHAMT) within Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942. DmJHAMT transfers the methyl groups from endogenous S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) to FFAs therefore synthesizing FAMEs. To minimize extraction costs, we aim to induce self-lysis in Synechococcus at maximum optical densities using quorum sensing. By regulating the production of autoinducers with promoters of various strengths, we plan to tune the optical density at which gene expression is activated.
https://teams.igem.org/2008	Therapeutics	One of the greatest barriers to long term space travel is the exposure to high energy ionizing radiation (IR). Exposure to IR can induce double stranded breaks which are very cytotoxic, resulting in cell death. Current solutions, while effective in low earth orbit, are less so outside of the magnetosphere. The 2016 U of C Calgary team address this problem through synthetic biology and the engineering of Bacillus subtilis. A strain of B. subtilis has been engineered to express a recombinant peptide, Bowman-Birk Protease inhibitor (BBI), which has radio-protective effects. The bacteria are contained within a patch, allowing for continuous secretion of the peptide into the body. While the initial system is designed to produce BBI, restriction sites within the gene constructs allow for any gene to be inserted, creating a versatile expression platform. This can be customized for the secretion of bio-therapeutics for future space missions.
https://teams.igem.org/2009	New Application	USTC team focuses on a kind of yeast prion called Sup35. It shares some properties with normal prion, but it’s harmless. We know that Sup35 aggregates between 37℃ and 42℃, and Guanidine Hydrochloride (GDNHCL) induces aggregated Sup35 to separate. We decide to take advantage of three characters of Sup35: assembling, thermal control and reversibility. The first circuit is based on Yeast Two-hybrid System. The aggregation of Sup35 results in the binding of AD and BD, then downstream gene GFP expresses. In the second circuit, we split sfGFP, a variant of GFP, into two fragments: sfGFP1-10 and sfGFP11. sfGFP11 is linked to Sup35. sfGFP1-10 spontaneously binds to sfGFP11 to show green fluorescence, however, aggregation of Sup35 inhibits the binding, thus the fluorescence disappears. Being regulated by temperature and GDNHCL, our circuits can be used as biological temperature control kill switch, as biological temperature indicator and in scientific research.
https://teams.igem.org/2010	Environment	As a Boston-based team with international roots, we view plastic pollution as both a global and local problem. Thus, we developed a sustainable, circular plastic degradation system that generates energy. We build upon work done by researchers at Kyoto Institute of Technology (Yoshida, 2016), and have engineered E. coli to break down polyethylene terephthalate (PET), which makes up one sixth of plastic products. Terephthalic acid, a byproduct of PET degradation, is then processed in a microbial fuel cell by Delftia tsuruhatensis to generate electricity. UV light, powered by the fuel cell, further contributes to PET degradation. Looking ahead, we hope our work on Plastiback will empower and inspire future sustainable technologies.

People who are overweight and lack of exercise have a high risk of developing Type ll diabetes. In this era, quite a few people nelignent to check about their disorder of their condition - diabetes among of them. Having known this problem , Our team (TCU_TAIWAN) wants to warn the people to detect diabetes in the early stages before it advances further, especially for those who never take any diabetes test before. Our goal is to develop self-detection in order to make it more convenient. This product can be obtain everywhere because the material that we used to achieve our goal is not very expensive. Also, our diabetes detector is easy to use, so that everybody can check whether they have diabetes or not. .
https://teams.igem.org/2012	WIKI	Bio-pattern formation is the establishment of spatial patterns in morphogenesis. When guided by computer, the spatial pattern of a group of cells can be altered in an augmented reality space created by superposing a computer simulated virtual space on a real culture apparatus. In our project, light-switchable synthetic gene circuits are adopted to control the mobility of E. coli cells by light-mediated real-time communication between the real bio-pattern in culture media and its virtual counterpart in computer simulation to implement a synchronized growth. Eventually, the shape of the colony matches the preset pattern we want and thus a “what you see is what you get” platform for the study of bio-pattern formation is obtained. Our system can also be extended to eukaryotic cell community to modulate cell fates in the future which will be particularly useful in aiding the development of biological tissues and the regeneration of organs.
https://teams.igem.org/2013	Energy	In view of increasingly serious issues on plastic pollution, greenhouse effect and energy shortage, various attempts were made to figure out approaches to settle these problems but we have not got the perfect answer yet. Inspired by the effort of Kyoto Institute of Technology, we come up with an idea to try solving these three problems by using synthetic biology methods. Plastic-degrading enzymes PETase and MHETase were produced by modified bacteria in order to hydrolyze plastics into TPA and EG, followed by a series of metabolism which transforms TPA into pyruvate, and finally, isobutanol was synthesized through pyruvate, catalyzed by two enzymes KDC and ADH. In a word, we use genetically modified bacteria to degrade plastic and produce isobutanol as clean energy.
https://teams.igem.org/2014	Manufacturing	Our group aims to generate sugar-induced expression system for Escherichia coli, which consists of promoters induced by arabinose, rhamnose, xylose and melibiose. The system is tightly regulated, provides independent induction of at least two different promoters and can be efficiently blocked by glucose. We have introduced various modifications of promoter sequences to obtain minimal, fully functional promoters, possibly stronger than original versions copied from E. coli genome. The modifications include changes in 5'UTR regions, likely ribosome binding sites and secondary structures to evaluate how those features affect translational machinery. We have also focused on open reading frame (ORF) optimization. Using bioinformatic analysis we have created sfGFP and mRFP variants composed exclusively of the most frequent or the rarest codons. We have also designed ORFs to control codon context effects and GC content for evaluation of their influence on translational effectiveness.
https://teams.igem.org/2015	Village	Circularization of a protein is one of the ways to enhance its stability against various temperatures and pH levels. This year, HokkaidoU_Japan challenged ourselves to circularize proteins using self-assembling peptides and linkers. Self-assembling peptide (SAP) is an amphiphilic peptide which self-assembles under physicochemical conditions. We made SAPs fused to link ends of the protein. We also inserted cysteine residues in the linker which is essential for the circularization so that they form a disulfide bond. This linker put on the both ends of a protein would make some strong bonds. Our linkers are expected to be applicable to most proteins. These two elements - the self-assembling peptide and the linker - enable the protein to be circularized.
https://teams.igem.org/2016	Diagnostics	Antibiotic resistance has been declared by the World Health Organisation as “one of the biggest threats to global health”. Over-prescription of antibiotics is a major issue promoting antibiotic resistance. We have designed a device that aims to rapidly distinguish bacterial infections, thereby preventing mis-prescription of antibiotics. In the war for iron, bacteria produce siderophores that scavenge Fe3+ from blood. In response, the immune system produces lipocalin-2 which sequesters siderophores. Lipocalin-2 levels can increase 5-fold during a bacterial infection. Our device detects this difference by utilising Fur, an iron-dependant repressor regulating levels of RyhB which acts as an inverter repressing GFP, our reporter protein. Therefore, bacterial infection results in a weak GFP signal in contrast to a strong signal in patients without bacterial infection. With our device, we potentially have the capability of rapidly determining the presence of any bacterial infection, enabling us to combat the mis-prescription of antibiotics.
https://teams.igem.org/2017	Food & Nutrition	Covering food necessities is mandatory, but resources are not sustainably exploited. Global strategies to increase food productivity and quality need to be concealed with a local perspective, providing breeders with the necessary technology to improve varieties. The aim of HYPE-IT is to decrease current technological barriers for breeding local crops using precision genome engineering, easing the gene editing process using SynBio-inspired simplified CRISPR/Cas9 tools. HYPE-IT brings along a software tool that associates crop traits with specific gene targets and designs optimal gRNAs for those targets. HYPE-IT also incorporates a modular gene circuit that serves as an in vivo gRNA testing system, ensuring appropriate gRNA choice even when no precise sequence information of local varieties is available. We aim to develop a split-Cas9 system based on viral vectors to efficiently deliver the editing machinery into the plant, and to create an affordable Labcase with the necessary laboratory equipment for HYPE-IT.
https://teams.igem.org/2018	Therapeutics	WHO estimates that antimicrobial resistance will cause 10 million premature deaths by the year 2050, exceeding cancer related deaths. The amount of antibiotics used worldwide creates a selective pressure on bacteria to evolve and share counter measures towards antibiotics, eventually rendering us defenseless even against simple infections. Our solution focuses on infections that occur in wounds which today are treated with band-aids and antibiotic therapy. We are working on a preventive band-aid consisting of recombinant spider silk with integrated antimicrobial peptides, thereby reducing the need for conventional antibiotics. We use spider silk due to its angiogenetic properties and proliferative effect on keratinocytes. The silk with the antimicrobial peptides will be attached to the plastic polymer, poly-β-hydroxy butyrate (PHB), with which our entire construct becomes biodegradable and immune-neutral. Our project, Bacto-Aid, faces the growing problems of plastic pollution and evolution of resistant bacteria.
https://teams.igem.org/2019	WIKI	Antibiotic resistance is a growing predicament in the battle against infectious diseases. Researchers have found promising methods to combat antibiotic resistance by directing Cas9 to cleave resistance genes; however, delivering Cas9 in vivo remains difficult. Current methods of delivering Cas9 plasmids in vivo are limited by expression regulation in recipient cells, and by pathological complications associated with toxic contaminants or harsh administration requirements. Our team aims to deliver Cas9 protein via bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), whose delivery selectivity and immunological toxicity can be modified. Unlike other systems delivering Cas9-encoding DNA, this technology will enable the delivery of functional Cas9 protein and will serve as a model whole-protein delivery system for a wide array of applications.
https://teams.igem.org/2020	New Application	Photocaging is a remarkable method of compound inhibition that can be reversed by exposure to light. Previously, it had been used for intracellular studies. We wish to apply this method to industrially needed proteins as well and call attention to its usefulness there. As an example we would like to render the use of high quantities of the chemical enzyme inhibitor boric acid unnecessary, which is classified as a substance of very high concern by the European Chemicals Agency. At the moment, boric acid is used for protease inhibition in washing detergents and dilution in the washing machine activates it again. Thus, tons of it are being processed every year. Photocaging could help circumvent this. A photocaged amino acid will be incorporated at a crucial position in the enzyme by genetic codon reassignment. Prior to the washing procedure the enzyme can be easily activated by exposure to a light source.
https://teams.igem.org/2022	Village	Some bacteria naturally bleb: a process whereby their outer membrane pinches in and buds off. The result of this is an outer membrane vesicle (OMV), a nanoscale lipid bubble, released into the environment. These OMVs can be decorated on the outside with outer membrane proteins, and can encapsulate periplasmic proteins within. Given this, OMVs have the potential to be tailored to a variety of functions, by targeting proteins either to the periplasm or outer membrane. This customisable nature means that OMVs could become a new platform technology for the application of future synthetic biology projects. Currently, however, there is no standardised system for inducing hypervesiculation in bacteria, and thus our project compares the effect of different genetic factors on OMV formation. With this data we will produce the ultimate strain of blebbing bacteria which can be utilised for the production of OMVs adapted for environmental, medical, or industry purposes.
https://teams.igem.org/2023	Environment	Nowadays, Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) are commonly found pollutants that have been proved present in a wide variety of everyday life situations. Though they are dangerous and present almost everywhere, VOCs are not efficiently detected. Usual detection devices are very unprecise or requires a very long exposure time. We tried to address this problem by building a biosensor, perfectly adapted to on-field measurements that would allow us to easily and rapidly quantify the amount of VOCs in the air. This biosensor relies on bioluminescence, a biochemical phenomenon that is commonly used in cell imaging. We are trying to develop a new application for bioluminescence that should allow us to create a biosensor of a new kind, entirely different from the existing devices. We are also working with aeronautical engineers in order to develop a drone able to safely contain our bacteria,that will later be used as a mobile detection platform.
https://teams.igem.org/2024	Village	The bacterium Ideonella sakaiensis was discovered in 2016 by Japanese researchers from the Kyoto Institute of Technology. It is able to degrade PET - a common consumer plastic - into terephthalic acid, which poses no threat to our environment. We aim to isolate the two enzymes within Ideonella sakaiensis that undertake this reaction, PETase and MHETase, and express them in Escherichia coli. PETase first breaks down PET into methyl-(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate or MHET. MHETase then converts MHET into terephthalic acid. The two enzymes will be assayed for activity, after which we shall analyse them using Cryo Electron Microscopy to produce a 3D structure with a point resolution of 0.27 nm. We then aim to secrete these enzymes into the periplasm of the bacterium using the OmpA secretion system within E. coli. This will be achieved by fusing a leader sequence to the two enzymes from the OmpA gene.
https://teams.igem.org/2025	Software	Synthetic DNA holds a great promise for high-density, long-term and massive information storage. As the cost of DNA synthesis and sequencing decreases at an accelerated pace, practical application of DNA as information storage medium is on the horizon. However, there lacks a bridge to connect the current electronic-based information technology (IT) world with the future DNA-based biotechnology (BT) information world. To address this need, we develop a web-based software tool, Bio101, to encode conventional electronic computer files into nucleotide (nt) sequences and to decode the latter into original data format reversely. Through a five-step process, compression, encryption, bit-to-nt conversion, indexing and validation, Bio101 can convert any computer file into a set of short, non-bioactive DNA sequences which are ready to be delivered to a DNA synthesis company for the physical writing-in. A user-friendly webpage makes the technique available at everyone’s fingertip.
https://teams.igem.org/2026	High School	We endeavor to create a test paper which is programmable, open-source and cell-free. The test papers contain genetic circuits which could measure the concentration of various target molecules in clinical and laboratory samples with visual and semi-quantitative results shown by reporter proteins. With a genetic device which acts as a signal amplifier, the system resembles the binary system of computer with enhanced sensitivity. The bionic and open-source nature of the test paper results in a high range of detection as well as high programability, while the cell-free nature removes interference between biological reactions inside the cells and allows its preservation under frozen condition for almost a year. The system can also be reprogrammed with the aid of our protocol, another proof of its potential.
https://teams.igem.org/2027	Manufacturing	Atmospheric exploration, both on Earth and beyond, requires putting instrumentation into those atmospheres. Traditionally balloons have been ideal tools for atmospheric research: to track weather patterns, wind patterns, and to monitor atmospheric composition. Our team is working to create a completely biological balloon that is light, that is potentially biodegradable, and that can be both continuously and sustainably produced. To make the balloon itself, we are engineering bacteria to produce membrane polymers with different properties. To inflate the balloon, we are using algae to produce biological hydrogen to fill the balloon. To increase balloon durability, we are looking for biological ways to make our materials radiation resistant. Finally, to functionalize our balloon we are creating biological temperature and small molecule sensors. When combined to form a biological balloon these projects could create a completely novel category of scientific instrument: cheap, light, durable, and useful.
https://teams.igem.org/2028	High School	BNDS_China is going to enable Escherichia Coli (E. coli) bacteria to absorb calcium cations (Ca++) from hard water. By the definition of hard water, the exceeded concentration of calcium ions causes extra soap consumption and galvanic corrosion. Though there are already methods of softening hard water, they are either too expensive or inefficient. Therefore, our team came up with this idea of making E. coli attracts calcium cations from hard water that serves as an affordable and functional form of hard water softener. E. coli with highly expressed Calcium channel proteins absorb those calcium ions from the water into cytoplasm to decrease the concentration of calcium in water.
https://teams.igem.org/2029	Manufacturing	Recycling of printed paper has made an indisputable contribution to conserving our environment. However, current recycling methods consume vast amounts of energy and release toxic byproducts. Prior research has identified a number of enzyme classes that can efficiently replace the chemicals currently used in paper recycling. Despite their ability to facilitate the separation of ink particles from paper fibers, a process called deinking, enzymes have not been widely used industrially due to insufficient knowledge about efficiency and costly production and purification methods. In our project, we tackled these issues and took significant steps towards catalyzing research in the area and applying enzymatic paper recycling on an industrial scale. We developed a high throughput system which not only allows us to quantify deinking efficiency, but also to cheaply mass produce enzymes using a B. subtilis secretion system.
https://teams.igem.org/2030	Europe	Current methods of chemical synthesis from petroleum have led to great environmental disruption and continue to be a strong contributor to the emission of carbon dioxide. To overcome this problem, biosynthesis is the most viable alternative. The main drawback of biosynthesis is the high price of raw material, comprising over 60% of the production cost. Our solution for this complex problem is to create a self-sustaining co-culture of microorganisms that produces its own raw material, using light and carbon dioxide. Cyanobacteria provide the carbon source for the production organism, which in exchange produces an essential amino acid for the cyanobacteria while creating the desired product. By making several species compatible with this synthetic symbiosis, the platform will allow efficient conversion of atmospheric carbon dioxide into products in an environmentally friendly and sustainable way.

https://teams.igem.org/2032	Environment	Global climate change is the most profound threat facing society. Greenhouse gasses like carbon dioxide and methane are major contributors, with methane being 29 times more potent than carbon dioxide. Sources of methane include landfills and animal farms. Current methods to control methane emissions include combustion into carbon dioxide, which depletes methane but at the levels present naturally is inefficient for generating energy. We plan to create strains of E. coli that break down methane using methane monooxygenase from methanotrophs, organisms that use methane as an energy source. Methane will be oxidized into methanol, which could be extracted for industrial use, but we plan instead to introduce other metabolic pathways (perhaps in co-cultured bacteria) that convert methanol into cellular metabolites (biomass) or else carbon dioxide. Our biological removal of methane could be implemented into the piping of landfills as an environmentally friendly strategy for ameliorating global climate change.
https://teams.igem.org/2033	WIKI	Many bacteria use quorum sensing (QS) to regulate group behaviors, such as bioluminescence and virulence, by sending and receiving small molecules called homoserine lactones (HSLs). Bioengineers have incorporated QS networks into genetic circuits, using HSLs to connect logical operations. However, higher-order genetic circuitry is inhibited by “crosstalk,” in which one QS network responds to HSLs produced by another network. In addition to making it challenging to engineer with multiple QS networks, crosstalk has the dangerous potential to activate virulence pathways in pathogenic bacteria. Using a system that decouples “Senders” from “Receivers,” we are exploring how QS networks from different species behave and which networks have crosstalk. Our project adds 21 new plasmids for QS-based communication, including 12 novel QS proteins, to the iGEM Registry, helps to deepen the knowledge of bacterial communication, explores biosafety implications of engineering with HSLs, and empowers bioengineers to build more complex genetic circuits.
https://teams.igem.org/2034	Environment	North American bats are suffering from an emerging fungal disease called White Nose Syndrome. Affected hibernacula often face mortality rates in excess of 80%, an unsustainable loss in animals that only have one offspring per year. As it spreads, the disease impacts many bat species with roles in pest control and pollination. Last year, we looked into modifying E. coli so that it would produce the volatile organic compound ocimene, which has been shown to slow fungal growth. This year we are continuing this work and are also investigating ways to sense WNS to attempt to impact the cave environment as little as possible and target the fungus directly. We aim to analyze the use of leupeptin A and B found in S. roseus to possibly inhibit the fungus’s ability to degrade collagen, one of the many affects from the fungus’ metabolism of the bats’ skin and wings.

https://teams.igem.org/2036	Foundational Advance	Stable gene expression within a threshold of novel system is very important to syn-biology creations. To achieve the goal, we tried to build a set of positive feedback fundamental tool kits in bi-stable or even multi-stable systems. The systems we have designed will not only be adaptable to some certain input or output signals, but also can change their threshold to meet different project purposes. Most significantly, the positive feedback regulation system can transform an input pulse into stable output. So it can be applied in circuits as signal filter, which is very useful to many applications, such as treatment to lactose intolerance. We even further provided both prokaryotic version (engineered from cI/cro in bacteria phage γ system) and eukaryotic version (adopted from abscisic acid related kinase system) to make it competent tool kits for synthetic biology engineers to compare and select for further application.
https://teams.igem.org/2037	WIKI	The world population consumes approximately 3500 kWh/y/capita, increasing the demand for clean alternative energy. Recent improvements of photo-bioelectrochemical cells (PBEC), which harness electrons from photosynthesis to generate electricity, include synthetic attachment of chloroplast thylakoids to graphene electrodes. However, current attachment techniques require costly chemically synthesized linkers and PBECs are not yet efficient enough for industrial energy generation. In this project, DNA aptamers were designed and evaluated as low-cost biological linkers to tether plant photosystem II (PSII) complexes to graphene foam electrodes. Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment (SELEX), together with software developed by team Heidelberg 2015 (MAWS and JAWS) were used to develop PSII- and graphene-binding DNA aptamer candidates. This project aims to improve the attachment and orientation of the PSII complex to the graphene electrode for higher electron transfer efficiency, and serves as a prototype for the in planta expression of RNA aptamers for self-assembling thylakoid attachment.

https://teams.igem.org/2039	Foundational Advance	The regulation of gene expression is known to be controlled by transcriptional regulators in prokaryote. However, recent observations suggest that the expression of genes can also be affected by their spatial localization due to chromatin conformation. Our project aims at testing this hypothesis and determining if the expression of genes under the control of promoters of different strengths can be affected by their spatial proximity. We thus designed a new adaptable tool composed of two different dCas9s fused with the FRB / FKBP12 dimerization system (induced by rapamycin) to increase the spatial proximity of two different DNA regions. We also designed a tool composed of two dCas9s and a tripartite split-GFP to visualize the spatial proximity of these two DNA regions. Altogether, these tools offer new perspectives for gene expression control and visualization of the spatial proximity of chromosomal regions.
https://teams.igem.org/2040	Environment	Oriental fruit fly (Bactrocera dorsalis) is a major invasive pest that causes billion-dollar worth of crop damage each year. Many methods are applied to control its population, however, each comes with its own set of disadvantages. That is why we looked to Metarhizium anisopliae to solve the problem. While its efficacy is limited by environmental factors like UV, temperature, and humidity, scientists have improved its virulence through genetic engineering at the cost of its survivability due to concerns over GMOs. This year, we aim to design a biosafety switch to avoid compromising its survivability, the in-out-suicide-in-genetically-engineered-Metarhizium (IOS-i-GEM). Comprised of hemolymph and blue light sensing mechanisms, the system allows the fungus to kill its host before inducing the CRISPR/Cas9 kill switch to cause genome-wide mutations. With the IOS-i-GEM system in hand, scientists could create different genetically modified M. anisopliae strains for different pests without worrying about their biosafety.

If we can get early diagnosis and effective treatment measures,it will largely reduce the mortality of breast cancer. Studies have shown that when have breast cancer, the expression degree of microRNA-21 and microRNA-155 in the serum will be significantly higher than the normal one. Based on it,this project applies the artificial designed biological system to realize the detection of expression levels of microRNA in the serum environment and produce green fluorescent protein,then detect fluorescence by miniaturized signal hardware,through the mathematical modeling of the model to calculate microRNA expression level. Finally the data presented to the user directly by the hardware device or to their phones.

Traditional plastics can take up to 1000 years to degrade, whereas alternative bioplastics can be decomposed in 80 days. The aim of our project is to produce Poly-Lactic Acid (PLA), a biodegradable polymer and a thermoplastic, by engineering Pseudomonas putida. PLA bioproduction presents several benefits compared to chemical synthesis: it uses simple carbon sources and it is inexpensive. On the other hand, P. putida is a safe organism reported to be efficient for polymerization, which gives advantages over other possible chassis. By modification of its metabolic pathways, we aim to improve PLA biosynthesis yields in a sustainable manner and determine the usability of our bioplastic by manufacturing a vesicle for drug delivery.

The most widely used solvent in dry cleaning is perchloroethylene (PERC), a volatile carcinogen that is increasingly banned and restricted for environmental and safety reasons. Our team is using synthetic biology to replace PERC with a biological alternative. To do so we are screening samples from all around the world to look for stain-digesting microbes, we are characterising candidate enzymes with putative stain digesting activity, and we are searching for fabric binding domains to enhance their stain fighting power! With some microbiology, synthetic biology, metabolic engineering and a lot of creativity we will find a green technology to make dry cleaners forget all about PERC.

DNA will be used to encode the information of points and pathways on the map, and log into the bio-navigation database. In this way, each feasible solution can be obtained by the corresponding biochemical operation. Because of the high parallelism of the DNA calculation, the solution is rapid. Then by selecting the feasible solutions, finally determine the optimal solution. Compared with AHUT_China 2014's project, BIO-COMPASS 2.0 has added identification site, path length, and adjacent site number information into the DNA sequence used for path expressing. Besides, Quaternary has been applied in our calculation to optimize the data extraction methods. These improvements have boosted our system’s practicability and suitability when it is applied into more complex navigation.

Our project consists of equipping microbes with nanoparticles and engaging them into battle. Nanoparticles were synthesized in different sizes, shapes, and compositions, using plant, chemical, and microbial based synthesis methods. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli were equipped with these nanoparticles on their cell surfaces using multiple bioconjugation methods to generate battle armours. The effectiveness of the armours were investigated under a gauntlet of environmental conditions. For the grand finale, equipped cells were introduced into a microfluidic chip called the Battledome, within which individual cells collide to fight until an ultimate MicroGladiator is determined. An entertaining and academic web-series was produced as a portion of our human practices work. It showcases cell battles alongside the research, serving as a tool to enhance the public’s discussion of synthetic biology.

https://teams.igem.org/2047	Foundational Advance	Generally, stem-loops forming polynucleotides are more stable than the single-stranded ones. Particularly, mRNA with a stem-loop at its 3'- or 5'-end often has a longer half-life than their linear counterpart owing to the stem loops' resistance to exoribonucleases. Our team designed a polycistron gene expression construct, in which each gene followed by a stem-loop and an endoribonuclease cleavage site. When it is transcribed, digested by the endoribonuclease, and cleaved into independent mRNAs with different stem-loops, different mRNA shows different stability, determined by the designed Gibbs free energy (∆G) of their stem-loops, resulting in different expression level of their encoded proteins. In this way, we decouple the gene expression level of the same operon simply by designing different stem-loops. In addition, by quantitatively adjusting the free energy of the stem-loops, we can even achieve a stoichiometry expression of the target proteins precisely, like playing a beautiful concerto of cistrons.

A biosensor is a device that utilizes genetic circuits to detect and report the presence of specific compounds. Certain naturally occurring bacteria have the ability to sense metals such as iron, zinc, copper, silver, gold and cadmium. By using existing biological pathways, we will develop a cell-free paper-based biosensor that is easy to use, scalable and affordable for detecting gold. Our team will use of the transcriptional activator, GolS, which induces protein expression in the presence of gold ions. Downstream reporter genes will act as visual indicators. Using state of the art machine learning and artificial intelligence methods, our team will engineer a colorimetric analytic tool for interpreting the visual indicators and reporting the presence of gold.
https://teams.igem.org/2050	Therapeutics	Although antiretroviral therapy has allowed for the management of HIV infection, being a lifelong therapy, it has significant economic burden, side effects, and risk of resistance. A therapeutic DNA vaccine is the best candidate for a cure for HIV infection, but DNA vaccine trials have so far been unsuccessful due to silencing of the antigen-coding gene and/or insufficient innate immune activation. To address this problem, we designed a vector with a synthetic promoter (based mainly on the ckm and itgax genes) designed to facilitate strong expression in muscle and myeloid cells, blocks of CpG DNA motif designed to stimulate innate immunity through toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), and a dsRNA-coding Pol III-dependent gene designed to stimulate innate immunity through retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) receptor. This vector will allow for the development of a new generation of highly potent DNA vaccines against HIV, hence the project designation HI,Vax!

In most cases, vaccines or treatments are not available, and insecticides are the primary source for vector control. Consequently, over spraying of insecticides impacts the environment and leads to the selection of insecticide resistant mosquitoes. Therefore, we developed a novel diagnostic device, Mos(kit)o that includes a fixed or mobile mosquito trap and a biosilica cellulose composite patch from genetically modified E. coli. The design of the patch creates a multilayered matrix coated with antibodies capable of detecting a wide panel of vector-borne pathogens and insecticide resistant marker proteins from captured mosquitoes. Additionally, the patch will have 2D barcoded readouts, generating an environmental surveillance database. A precise map of vector hot spots will provide a better assessment and response to vector-borne diseases, assisting local health authorities with anticipating and preparing for an epidemic.

Logic gates can be easily incorporated into our designs to test various combinations of miRNA targets. G-quadruplexes form when the specified target hybridize with the probe, generating fluorescence in the presence of substrate. We endeavour to demonstrate intracellular synthesis, self-assembly and functioning of our nanostructures inside E. coli. Our constructs open up new possibilities in future research on DNA nanotechnologies as diagnostic tools, and promote the applications of miRNA testing in clinical conditions.
https://teams.igem.org/2055	Environment	The modern lifestyle of a growing population increasingly relies on electronic equipment. As a result, the amount of discarded electronics (e-waste) is rising worldwide. The costs of proper collection and recycling of e-waste may exceed the revenues generated from the recovered materials, due to the complexity of separating them. We propose a synthetic biology approach in Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans and Chromobacterium violaceum to enhance metal recovery from e-waste in a three-step bioleaching process. First, the enzyme TetH will be overexpressed in A. thiooxidans in order to enhance leaching of copper, iron, and tin. Then, C. violaceum will leach gold and silver. Cyanide is responsible for this leaching activity, and the enzymes that produce it will be expressed under the control of a gold sensitive promoter. Overexpression of a cyanide-degrading enzyme will reduce toxicity. Implementing a voltaic cell in the final stage will allow precipitation of the previously recovered metals.

Our aim is to produce a portable, quick and easy to use Biosensor device for environmental law enforcement agencies and even consumers that can detect for levels of carbon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen in vehicle exhausts and express corresponding chromoproteins as a result. The system is based on two separate gas-sensing mechanisms that work together to give a range of results. The mechanism sensing for carbon monoxide uses the CooA transcription factor and two CooA dependent promoters: CooF and CooM. The NOx sensing mechanism uses the NsrR repressed promoters, YeaR and NirK, as well as the NorV promoter.

Escherichia coli K12 will be transformed with the genes required to detect P. aeruginosa and also with the alginate lyase gene (ALYG), in tandem with a bacteriocin. The ALYG will have a signal peptide from Bacillus thuringiensis, which allow protein translocation in E. coli. These molecules will destroy the biofilm and the bacterium. Also, a Nisin producer bacterium (L. lactis) will be transformed with the genes required to detect P. aeruginosa and with an additional copy of Nisin.

In our proposed system, a Streptococcus pyogenes dCas9 isoform codon optimised for Escherichia coli is fused to the N-or C- terminal fragments of a thermostable pH-tolerant Pyrophorus plagiopthalamus luciferase (LUC). We aim to coexpress guideRNAs to target these chimeric dCas9-LUC proteins to adjacent DNA sequences. This will enable the reconstitution of luciferase activity and subsequent bioluminescence in the presence of luciferin. This light output constitutes a signal for detection of any targeted DNA sequence, dependent on access to the target sequence. We plan to undertake a proof of concept study of this system using gRNAs targeted to the E.coli 16S rRNA locus, to describe both the effective output of this system in vitro, and the optimum distance between gRNA targets. Finally we will investigate the feasibility of this diagnostic system as a clinical test.
https://teams.igem.org/2061	Therapeutics	Our team develops a system for the targeted delivery of CRISPR/CAS9 in order to fix Cystic Fibrosis (CF) mutations in the epithelium tissue. A comprised of a CRISPR/CAS9 plasmid linked to the B-subunit protein of the cholera toxin. The pentamer B-subunit is used here as a homing device, since it can bind with high affinity to the various ganglioside molecules present on the cell membrane of all epithelial cells. It has been found that regenerating respiratory epithelial cells of CF patients carry the asialo-GM1 ganglioside. The binding of the B-subunit to its receptor molecules results in the internalization, probably by endocytosis, of the protein, together with its linked cargo plasmid. Once inside the cells, the labile link can be cleaved. The released plasmid is then set free to reach the nucleus where it can be transcribed to his CRISPR/CAS9 components and fix the CF mutation by homologous recombination in vivo.

Since there are no vaccines for many MBIs, the best option for avoidance is preventing bites. The project aims to engineer a repellent in which the bacterial species Pseudomonas putida (P.P.) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (S.E.) synthesize rhamnolipids, a compound known to repel mosquitos. The following objectives were established: clone rhamnolipid-producing strains, test the safety/efficacy of bacteria producing rhamnolipids, and develop the product. The operon (RhlAB and RhlC) that produces enzymes in the rhamnolipid synthesis pathway from Pseudomonas aeruginosa was cloned into P.P. and S.E. Mosquito experiments will confirm the quantity of rhamnolipids needed for full protection. Safety will be assessed using human skin cells and mouse models.

Many of these natural products are produce by Non-Ribosomal Peptide Synthatases (NRPSs), which are megaenzymes found in certain fungi and bacteria. These products are great lead compounds but often possess poor pharmacokinetics or high toxicity. NRPS can incorporate non-standard amino acids, and have the ability to append unique substituents onto their product. These factors make optimizing lead compounds extremely difficult through synthetic chemistry. Using nature as our guide along with the tools of synthetic biology we will be modifying NRPS at the DNA-level to improve the properties of lead compounds. We will be introducing tools to capture large NRPS gene clusters, append chemical modifications onto products, and screen NRPS production in a high throughput fashion. Synthesizing lead compounds will be as easy as “Pharming the Blues”.
https://teams.igem.org/2065	New Application	iGEM TU Eindhoven has developed new scaffold proteins that can control protein-protein interactions based on the 14-3-3 protein from the Tobacco plant (T14-3-3). In nature T14-3-3 proteins interact with the last 52 amino acids from the plant plasma H(+)-ATPase membrane protein (CT52). This binding is stabilized by the small molecule Fusicoccin, allowing chemically inducible assembly of CT52 on T14-3-3. In addition, CT52 has a free N-terminal end, enabling the attachment of proteins. In order to design new chemically controllable heterodimeric and tetrameric variants of T14-3-3, the Rosetta software package was utilized. These variants were used to bring CT52-fused proteins together on the scaffolds under influence of Fusicoccin, inducing the desired protein-protein interaction. Thus offering a way to chemically control protein-protein interactions. The heterodimeric scaffolds were used to test the viability of a chemically inducible CRISPR/Cas9 system and tetrameric scaffolds to test the viability of a Caspase 9 kill switch.

To remedy these issues, we have taken both a synthetic and cellular approach to targeted drug therapy via protein cages and recombinant bacteria. We aim to create self­-assembling protein cages capable of cleavage by thrombin proteases at blood clot sites. These cages, characterized through dynamic light scattering and PAGE, would be pre-loaded with anticoagulant drugs to reduce the risk of systemic hemorrhage and treat thrombosis. Additionally, we propose an alternative to broad spectrum antibiotics using contact-dependent inhibition (CDI) systems that mediate intercellular competition between gram­-negative strains. Through Gibson assembly and Lambda-­red recombineering, we will engineer bacteria capable of inhibiting selected strains by exporting foreign CDI systems into DH5-­alpha. Furthermore, we intend to identify the target receptor recognized by Enterobacter aerogenes’ CDI system through transposon mutagenesis. These approaches aim to meet the need for targeted treatments to reduce adverse nonspecific interactions.

Although chemical pesticides and fungicides have been used against these pathogens, they often result in the accumulation of toxic compounds or increase the resistance of the pathogens. This is why biocontrol using microorganisms has become a viable alternative. Myxobacteria are a common and diverse group of bacteria largely fed through predation, able to produce a wide range of secondary metabolites. The fungal antagonisms may be due to competition for nutrients or the production of antifungal compounds. The aim of this investigation is genetically engineer Myxobacteria mainly to enhance their antifungal capabilities and increase their temperature resistance. We intend to isolate phytopathogenic organisms from damaged alfalfa crops nearby Chihuahua city, and prove the efficiency of our modified bacteria making confrontations between them. We also want to broaden the impact in affected crops such as chilli and potato.

In some cases, however, this point of view is not appropriate to describe lives. DNA sequences are not the sole factor which decides how an organism lives. Other factors are also able to control phenotype beyond generations. The purpose of our project is creating a genetic circuit functional in E. coli which allows E. coli to switch or loop back its gene expression and phenotype when each cell division takes place. This will be achieved by the use of the nrd promoter to sense to cell division, three types of sets of sigma factor/anti-sigma factor/sigma promoter control transcription orthogonally to make 3 states of gene expression, and a toehold switch to create an AND gate required in the circuit.

We believe that the tools of synthetic biology can be used to take advantage of this surplus by converting it to high value products and minimizing the amount of waste in agriculture. With this project we engineered bacteria to transform almond hulls into erythritol, a zero-calorie sweetener with a fast growing market. We take on the high cost of sugar alternatives, directly addressing diabetes and obesity, using the underutilized biomass of inedible agricultural co-products. Through public discussion, surveys, expert interviews, and cost analysis, we believe we can utilize synthetic biology to convert non-food almond co-products into Erythritol. In order to push our platform off the benchtop and into the real world, we considered the production costs of this product, and built a low cost bioreactor and purification system to directly address the price point.
https://teams.igem.org/2072	Food & Nutrition	Chinese medicine have been used for thousands of years. We focus our project on one of common Chinese medicinal herbs: Notoginseng. In the literature, oral uptake of notoginseng usually results in poor absorption of ginsenosides, one important group of bioactive ingredients of notoginseng, notably due to its chemical modification of glycosylations. We plan to use recombinant beta-glucosidase to modify ginsenosides to improve oral bioavailability. We will take two separate approaches: in vitro enzymatic reaction and solid fermentation to test our beta-glucosidase activity toward ginsenosides modification. We name our project iGUT for the purpose of emphasizing the importance of microorganisms of our gut in helping our nutrition and medicinal need, and would like to consider our recombinant beta-glucosidase containing E.coli as a model to develop new “probiotics-in-a-test-tube” for the modification of ginsenosides.
https://teams.igem.org/2073	Environment	“PFCs” is the abbreviation of perfluorinated chemicals. These compounds are produced or used in water-proof clothing in and semiconductor industry, which are harmful to our environment and potential carcinogen to human. In recent years, the PFCs pollution issue has gotten more and more attention to people. Because of the strong binding energy of carbon-fluorine bond, these perfluorinated compounds are chemical inertness, which makes these compounds very difficult to be degraded in nature. To solve this problem, we decide to use a special enzyme to break the C-F bond, which will make it easier to be decomposed naturally. Most PFCs pollution happens in waters, so we also design a bioreactor system to deal with the PFCs dissolved in water.
https://teams.igem.org/2074	Environment	In 2016, FAFU-CHINA will attach the effective protoxin gene, which isolated from Bacillus thuringiensis contained the characteristic of high efficient mosquito control, to Chlamydomonas reinhardtii as the chassis organism for cloning. However, there are many problems in the practical application by using Bacillus thuringiensis, such as the bacterial pollution of waters, or the poor timeliness which Bt. strains cannot colonize in the water. Our team use the pertinent literature as the basis for selecting the appropriate biological chassis, combinating the toxic protein, which in order to increase the effect of killing mosquito larvae and reduce the Bt. toxin tolerance. on the basis of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii expression system to optimize gene,enhance expression of results, and reconstruct the engineered bacteria in natural environment, we can settle the problems mentioned above.
https://teams.igem.org/2075	WIKI	TALE (Transcription Activator Like Effector) proteins are a new approach for genome editing. Due to a special changeable sequence of amino acids, TAL-effectors can easily bind to any DNA sequence and perform various functions. However, the proteins show a high instability outside living organisms and the function could only be proven in vivo. To date, the purification of TAL-effectors as well as the in-vitro application in the lab is difficult to perform. Our aim is to develop a circular TAL-effector in order to stabilize the protein. We are trying to design “TALebots”, a new type of recombinant proteins, which could be utilized in vitro and enable new techniques of genetic engineering in the lab.
https://teams.igem.org/2076	Environment	Production of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) was banned in 1979, but these toxic chemicals still remain in soil and water worldwide. Bioaccumulation of these probable carcinogens disrupts activity of the nervous, immune and endocrine systems of animals. The current testing methods are unable to detect PCBs at the levels required by the US EPA (Environmental Protection Agency). The UNH team proposed to develop a highly sensitive biosensor for biphenyl. Previous iGEM teams attempted to design PCB biosensors, but their results were not conclusive. Biphenyl is the chemical backbone of PCBs. Genetic circuits were designed using the bph operons from PCB degrading bacteria using E.coli as the host. If biphenyl is present in a water source, it should be converted into an intermediate that can activate the bph circuit and the signal will be further amplified through a positive feedback loop, resulting in a fluorescent output even at low concentrations of biphenyl.
https://teams.igem.org/2077	Manufacturing	<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> is used in a variety of valuable industrial processes. Its ability to grow and replicate utilizing aerobic respiration or fermentation, and its ability to survive without functional mitochondria, provide opportunities to control or alter mitochondrial function to optimize production processes or develop novel cellular subsystems in the mitochondrial space. To begin exploring these opportunities, we adapted two commonly used yeast expression vectors to the RFC 10 standard and used them to express yEGFP preceded by the mitochondrial localization signal from the mitoribosomal protein mRPS12. In addition, we attempted to demonstrate that aerobic respiration can be controlled by manipulating the expression of mRPS12. Without mRPS12, yeast mitochondria lack a functioning ribosome and become unable to produce proteins necessary for aerobic respiration. By expressing the mRPS12 protein in a haploid mRPS12 knockout strain, we investigated its usefulness as a means of regulating aerobic respiration in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>.

https://teams.igem.org/2080	Therapeutics	Many studies indicated that the apoptosis of cancer cells could be induced by increasing the outer mitochondrial membrane permeability（OMMP). Meanwhile, the activities of bax and bcl-2 can change OMMP，releasing cytc from mitochondria to cytoplasm. Cyt c leakage supports the formation of apoptosome, in turn leading to cell apoptosis. Therefore our project proposes to induce targeted apoptosis of lung cancer cells through regulating bax and bcl2 expression by tumor specific CRISPRi/a system.
https://teams.igem.org/2081	Village	In the 21st century most of the materials we use are made of plastics. From car chassis to food containers, these materials revolutionized the world; but are they inocuos? Recent studies demonstrate that they release toxins, such as BPA, when they're exposed to high temperatures (Gonzales 2011, p.62). This fact creates a conflict within our society in terms of health issues and environmental problems. The goal of our project is to inactivate the toxins and facilitate the cleaning of residual water and polluted water bodies. The idea is to transform a bacteria with plasmids containing the human genes TBG and TTR which will produce transport proteins. This proteins would bind to toxins released by plastics (BPA, phthalates, PCB, PBDE) bioaccumulation them in order to facilitate their removal. González, G. L., et al (2011).

https://teams.igem.org/2082	Foundational Advance	We are developing a novel system for generating binding proteins in E. coli via directed evolution. Such proteins could be utilized for target-mediated drug delivery and in diagnostics, especially for the detection of quickly evolving pathogens such as viruses. Moreover, many applications for basic research are also feasible. As the starting point of our system, we design a library of sequences encoding binding proteins in E. coli. Afterwards, we use a special DNA-Polymerase, for increasing diversity through error-prone replication of the desired sequence. Finally, binding proteins with high affinity to the target protein are selected. This selection is mediated by protein-protein interaction, granting a selective advantage to cells in which tight binding proteins are expressed by an increase in fitness under selective pressure. Therefore, the desired clones are enriched in the fermentation broth and can be identified easily.
https://teams.igem.org/2083	New Application	Nonsense and missense mutations cause numerous incurable diseases, including Cystic Fibrosis and Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, that affect millions of people worldwide. Gene therapy is the most promising treatment for these genetics diseases. The majority of current gene therapy techniques focus on correction of DNA sequences; our project focuses on direct editing of RNA sequences. Targeting RNA is advantageous because it permits a tunable and reversible editing system that can repair multiple mutations while circumventing the process of homology directed repair. We have constructed dCas9 fusions to the editing enzymes APOBEC1 and ADAR1/2 to enable CRISPR-targeted C-to-U and A-to-I edits to RNA, respectively. We have designed and thoroughly characterized a series of GFP-based reporters that enable the detection and quantification of RNA editing by these dCas9 fusions. Our project outlines the theoretical framework for a novel, tunable, and reversible gene editing strategy with myriad applications.
https://teams.igem.org/2084	WIKI	Thallium is a metal byproduct of ore extraction that pollutes waterways. Like other metals, thallium is toxic to humans. Current detection devices for thallium are sophisticated laboratory instruments that are inappropriate for use by the general public. Thus, we are developing a paper-based sensor for use at home to determine if drinking water needs further analysis for thallium levels.<br> <br>Our sensor detects thallium using a specific DNAzyme, which activates an oligonucleotide input for a genetically encoded toehold switch. Activating the switch leads to the expression of a reporter gene, which is easily detected. The DNAzyme sensor makes the circuit adaptable to other metals. The coupled genetic circuit is inexpensive to produce and also holds promise for signal amplification to improve the detection limit of the system. Finally, embedding the device on a paper substrate will provide the general population with a simple way to test the safety of drinking water.

https://teams.igem.org/2086	Environment	High nitrate levels caused by Nitrogen-rich fertilizers lead to numerous health and environmental consequences. By designing a bacteria that can thrive in this contaminated water and reduce the nitrates to other molecules, we can minimize the impact caused by high nitrate levels. Our approach is to engineer an E. coli that has these capabilities and will not be harmful to the environment. A portion of the nap operon found naturally in E. coli will be over-expressed to produce Nitrate Reductase that can reduce nitrate ions to nitrite ions. This design could be further built upon to eventually reduce nitrate ions completely to nitrogen gas. We also designed a kill switch that only allows the bacteria to grow in areas with high nitrate levels. A ΔserA strain of E. coli is used as the chassis and is complemented with a plasmid containing the serA gene with the nitrate-sensitive PyeaR promoter.
https://teams.igem.org/2087	WIKI	This project aims to develop a delivery platform for the Cas9 genome-editing tool. Cas9 is an RNA guided endonuclease that is revolutionizing the field of molecular biology and is now being applied to therapeutics for the site-specific modification of the genome. One of the major challenges facing CRISPR-Cas9 technology is efficient intracellular delivery and nuclear localization. To this end, we are producing a fusion protein of the NLS-tagged Cas9 endonuclease and an atoxic variant of the Clostridium difficile toxin B (aTcdB). The TcdB protein mediates cell penetration by binding extracellular epitopes, entering via endocytosis, and delivering the active toxin component through the endosome membrane. By expressing the Cas9 protein at the N-terminus, and knocking out the toxin’s active site residues, the pore-forming component of the aTcdB protein should facilitate intracellular delivery of the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing platform.
https://teams.igem.org/2088	Environment	In 1962 a book named Silent Spring revealing the Harm of chemical pesticides stirred the public. Months ago, substance called Permethrin and the intermediate product, 3-phenoxybenzoate, alerted the youth from NAU-China. To degradate the Permethrin and 3-phenoxybenzoate expeditiously we created SpringHealer. In the laboratory we separated degrading genes from the original strain and regulated the gene expression through changing the expression order and varying different RBS. To know the toxic hazards of 3-phenoxybenzoate deeply we do the drosophila toxicological experiment. Out of the laboratory, we looked around the surroundings hoping to make our Healer more meaningful. SpringHealer can not be put into the nature so we designed a mould to make it better.
https://teams.igem.org/2089	High School	In tropical and subtropical areas, under high-irradiance conditions, plants must efficiently protect photosystem II (PSII) from damage. In this project, we built several genetic circles with the chloroplast protein HYPERSENSITIVE TO HIGH LIGHT1 (HHL1) which response to high light and functions in protecting PSII against photodamage. We further measured the expression efficiency of HHL1 promoted by various photosensitive promoters with high-light exposure, and named the most effective one as Super-HHL1. Moreover, we studied the potential application for Super-HHL1 agriculture and economic. Taken together, we suggest that Super-HHL1 might effectively help various plants repairing PSII under high light.
https://teams.igem.org/2090	Village	Fungi producing harmful mycotoxins flourish on a variety of widely consumed crops, notably bananas, tomatoes, potatoes, and grains. Such fungal infections significantly reduce sustainability and food production in developing countries, where mycotoxin exposure from lack of advanced food storage are responsible for severe economic losses and 40% of diseases. As such, our team developed regulatable plasmids encoding secretable chitinases that hydrolyse the glycosidic bonds of chitin, a key structural polysaccharide in fungal cellular walls. By fusing LbCHI31 and LbCHI32 chitinase genes with a signal sequence from the alkaline phosphatase phoA gene, we successfully generated an Escherichia coli line that secretes chitinase specific to Fusarium oxysporum, a major pathogenic fungi. LbCHI31 and LbCHI32 expression and extracellular secretion were further quantified through characterization and analysis. This project will provide easily accessible, cost-effective methods for producing effective chitinases to combat fungal infections, thereby increasing crop yield, stabilizing financial growth, and reducing famine globally.
https://teams.igem.org/2091	Environment	The plastic waste problem has taken its toll on the environment and affects diverse eco systems. Many solutions are available, but their side effects are damaging the environment due to plastics toxicity. As plastic was only recently introduced to nature, native biodegradation solutions are not sufficient to overcome the massive amounts of plastic debris in oceans and land. Our goal is to improve biodegradation solutions using synthetic biology tools, from force evolution of a polyethylene degrading bacterium, through protein engineering of PET degrading enzyme, to genetically engineering a metabolic pathway that will enable our selected bacteria to consume PET as a sole carbon source. Moreover, utilizing the high energy stored in PET, electrons released from PET oxidation will be immediately harnessed at an anode of a biofuel cell for electricity production. Thus, our project will provide a clean, productive and energy efficient process for plastic biodegradation.
https://teams.igem.org/2092	New Application	Controlling alcohol consumption can be difficult, especially amongst students in the United Kingdom. A non-invasive sweat patch that provides real-time monitoring of blood ethanol levels would revolutionise how we control alcohol consumption. Our proposed prototype, AlcoPatch, is based on studies that demonstrate the correlation between sweat and blood ethanol concentrations. Our AlcoPatch utilizes Escherichia coli as a chassis to engineer two different devices which would generate visible colour changes according to sweat ethanol concentrations. The first is a cell-free mechanism that uses alcohol oxidase, derived from Pichia pastoris, to initiate redox chain reactions required for the colour conversion of indicator dyes. The second manipulates an ethanol-inducible gene-switch system, derived from Aspergillus nidulans, to regulate the expression of chromoproteins. To guide our experiments, we use an innovative ensemble modelling approach to account for the uncertainty in our parameters. This enables us to predict the most cost-effective design options for prototyping.
https://teams.igem.org/2093	Manufacturing	E. coli still remains the first host used for recombinant proteins production, for research and bioindustrial purposes. The mode of production of these proteins is predominantly periplasmic. A cell lysis step is necessary to the recombinant protein extraction, limiting the yield and the purity of the extracted proteins and hindering continuous production. Our solution is the insertion of a phage porin in the outer membrane. We aim to condition the porin’s opening system to create a gateway between the intra- and extra-cellular environment by getting rid of the cumbersome lysis step. We will use a directed evolution approach to mutate specific regions linked to the gate opening and subject the resulting mutants to strong specific selection pressure. Through this method we will attempt to create a regulating system for our gate’s opening/closure. Thanks to the Gatekeeper, E. coli will be used in continuous reactors to produce recombinant proteins.
https://teams.igem.org/2094	Energy	EFCs and MFCs have been studied for many years using variety of biological fuels. Many obstacle of these fuel cells is that they often use food sources for humans. Also they only produce a small amount of electricity. The goal of our project is to improve both of these problems. We used agar as the fuel, which is very abundant in the ocean but is not a primary food source for humans. We also combined traditional EFC and MFC to create EMFC which uses shewanella oneidensis MR-1 and diaphorase simultaneously to generate electricity. First, E.coli that displays agar degrading enzymes degrade agar to produce galactose and NADH. Galactose is then used by E.coli to produce lactate and formate which shewanella oneidensis can use to generate electricity. NADH is used by diaphorase to generate electricity as well.
https://teams.igem.org/2095	Village	This year LiU iGEM will be a part of the search for alternative energy sources, this as a result of global warming due to excessive use of fossil fuels. For this we will use CRISPR/Cas9 in unicellular model algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, which has shown great potential for production of biofuels. Previous research has attempted to modify algae to promote the lipid synthesis thereby optimizing them for biofuel production. In this project we want to create new Biobricks consisting of inducible promoters to couple with a CRISPR/Cas9-system in C. reinhardtii. The reason for the inducible promoters is to avoid complications such as toxicity of a constitutively active Cas9. By causing cultures of algae to undergo genetic modification in response to high intensity light we believe we can solve this problem. With this method genes can be targeted in the model algae in order to regulate the lipid synthesis.

https://teams.igem.org/2097	New Application	Kombucha is a fermented tea drink composed of a community of several types of bacteria and yeast. This study’s aim is to understand and manipulate this community to imbue kombucha with favorable properties for producers and consumers. One common problem producers face is ethanol overproduction by Lachancea fermentati, making the kombucha alcoholic. This study screens L. fermentati using YPD agar plates with bromothymol blue, which changes color with changes in acidity. The color change allows for low-ethanol producing colonies to be selected for and recapitulated into the microbial community. Another issue for some would-be consumers is the taste of kombucha. By codon-optimizing an Arabadopsis gene for bacteria, Gluconobacter and Gluconoacetobacter can be transformed to produce brazzein, a sweet-tasting protein, thus sweetening the kombucha. Furthermore, these chassis organisms will be transformed with a GFP gene and pH-activated promoter to create a time-lapse of the changes that kombucha’s microbial community undergoes.

https://teams.igem.org/2099	Foundational Advance	Gene drives induce biased inheritance of specific genes and are currently being considered as a method to regulate mosquito populations. However, the ability of gene drives to spread quickly through entire populations raises serious ethical concerns, especially when the genetic change affects reproduction. To address this issue, we constructed both a gene drive and an inducible recovery drive and modeled the combined system using <I>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</I>. Our gene drive results in deletion of both copies of the ADE2 gene from <I>S. cerevisiae</I> using the CRISPR/Cas system, causing the yeast to turn red. As a safety mechanism, we constructed a tetracycline-inducible recovery drive to counteract the function of our gene drive. The recovery drive restores the ADE2 gene allowing <I>S. cerevisiae</I> to return to its original color. Our gene/recovery drive system advances foundational work towards controlling global pests and invasive species, protecting information stored in DNA, and various other important applications.
https://teams.igem.org/2100	Diagnostics	Affecting approximately 1 in 10 women, endometriosis is a disease caused by cells similar to the endometrium of the uterus growing elsewhere in the body. These growths, called endometrial lesions, cause severe chronic pain and infertility. Because the only definitive diagnostic method is laparoscopic surgery, patients wait on average seven years between the onset of symptoms and an accurate diagnosis. <p>The goal of the MIT iGEM team’s project is to expedite this diagnosis process with a genetic circuit that can sense the unique biomarkers of endometriosis. Our circuit identifies whether cells are diseased by checking the cells’ miRNA profiles and by sensing progesterone resistance, a hallmark of endometriosis. This identification process can be implemented in endometrial biopsy samples, eliminating the need for surgical diagnosis. Our approach could lead to a less invasive diagnostic method, enabling earlier treatment and improving patient outcomes. </p>
https://teams.igem.org/2101	WIKI	Cyanobacteria inhabit a range of environments and exhibit an array of biogeochemical specific processes as they capture light and concentrate CO2 into biomass. They can be installed in a variety of location and can actually thrive in wastewater and assist in bioremediation. Like many molecules explored in materials applications, dye-stuffs are challenging to synthesize because of low yields over several expensive synthetic steps. Interestingly, dye motifs are produced in cyanobacteria in the form of tetrapyrollic dyes motifs including; heme, chlorophyll and phycocyanobilin (PCB), where PCB proteins have also been utilized in immunoassay kits. In fact, the biosynthesis of PCB is an attractive pathway to manipulate owing to the potential to prepare a myriad of tetrapyrrollic derivatives. These derivatives, have been studied extensively for light-based applications and the ability to genetically direct the bacterial synthetic machinery would be significantly beneficial towards CO2 sequestration, and the production of low-cost dyes.

The first plasmid will be a bicistronic CYP2e1/NPR plasmid for expression of the Cytochrome P450 detoxification protein, as well as the reductase gene that allows for its expression. 2. The second plasmid will be the aldB gene, which serves as a serve to breakdown aldehydes. 3. The plasmid will be purified and isolated for possible implantation into a variety of biological systems. We aim to utilize the two plasmids in conjunction in order to safely break down toxic compounds.
https://teams.igem.org/2104	Village	Choosing apt and reliable protocols for new experiments is a problem that wet labs routinely face due to the difficulty in anticipating which protocols will produce the best results. Experimental practices may differ immensely across laboratories and precise details of these practices may be lost or forgotten as skilled faculty or students leave the lab to pursue other endeavors. Furthermore, there are few well-defined protocols that are generally agreed upon by the scientific community, in part due to the lack of a system that can supply a measure of a protocol’s acceptance. In order to address these problems, we set out to build a database that integrates a crowd-sourced ratings and comments system to serve as a protocol curator that enables wet lab investigators to compare various protocol efficacies, quantify a protocol’s acceptance within the scientific community, and provide an avenue through which experiential knowledge can be communicated.

This conditional, cell-free expression system could be freeze dried onto paper to create a simple test strip which can detect disease biomarkers in a sample in under two hours. If mass produced, a freeze-dried paper system could prove far more cost effective than current detection methods, 25 cents or less per use.

https://teams.igem.org/2107	Therapeutics	In 2010 it was estimated that 6.5 million people in the United States suffered from chronic wounds, accruing an annual cost of approximately $2.5 billion. Furthermore, experts predict that the burden of chronic wounds will increase rapidly in the near future. Chronic wounds are unable to heal in an orderly set of stages or within a time period of about three months. The etiology of chronic wounds is very diverse, but patients frequently suffer from persisting chronic wounds due to their bodies overproducing wound site proteases. In turn, these proteases decrease wound healing rates by degrading host growth factors and the extracellular matrix of the wound site. Our team is using a bioreactor and synthetic biology principles to purify and infuse platelet derived growth factor and a protease inhibitor into a synthetic collagen scaffold. We envision our technology will introduce a novel synthetic-biology-based process for the development of wound dressings.

However, whether pathogen reservoirs exist in emergency medical services (EMS) vehicles remains largely unknown. We characterized the microbiome of EMS vehicles using Nanopore next generation sequencing of isolated DNA samples. Based on the pathogens identified during sequencing, we developed a bacterial two hybrid selection system to generate custom single-domain antibodies (Nanobodies™) that recognize important pathogens. Selected antibodies were then used to create a rapid, low-cost and on site ELISA-based testing kit. Our project provides a framework for the detection of emergent pathogens and a practical solution for monitoring their presence within and outside of the healthcare system.
https://teams.igem.org/2110	Environment	The accumulation of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) has caused serious environmental problems worldwide. In recent years, biodegradation of PET has gained much popularity among scientists. Two enzymes, PETase and MHETase, were found this March and have much higher activity in degrading PET than any enzyme found before. We aim at improving the yield of these two enzymes by expressing them in fast-growing and well-researched model organisms like Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and we hope to obtain enzymes with higher activity by directed evolution. We build a report and self-regulated system to ensure the stability of our organisms and the production efficiency and activity of enzymes. Furthermore, we construct a co-culture system, in which different enzymes are expressed by separate organisms. We also extend the metabolic pathway in order to utilize the degradation product, TPA , to produce new environmental-friendly substances such as PHA.

Our project uses yeast to detect the presence of a specific medication, oxytocin – a naturally occurring hormone and medication that prevents postpartum hemorrhage during childbirth – the leading cause of maternal mortalities worldwide. Unrefrigerated oxytocin has a half-life of ~3 minutes, and only 8% of samples tested in a 2012 study in Ghana were kept at the appropriate temperature. Expired, low-quality, and unavailable medications are common occurrences throughout the developing world, but little is known about the impact on maternal outcomes due in part to the lack of low-cost diagnostic tests.

The current method of extending the shelf life of unpacked milk includes refrigeration which relies on supply of electricity. Here in, we propose to use short cationic antimicrobial peptides (scAMPs) containing alternating repeats of arginine and tryptophan as a preservative. We aim to genetically engineer Bacillus subtilis to produce scAMPs and safely deliver them using a novel sachet system regulated by temperature of the milk. The positive charge of arginine and the lipophilic nature of tryptophan in scAMPs will ensure disruption of the microbial cell wall and prevents milk spoilage. The outcome of the project will have a high impact in developing and under developed nations where electricity is scarce.
https://teams.igem.org/2114	Therapeutics	The treatment of diseases while avoiding systemic side effects is still a major obstacle in modern medicine. After administration, conventional drugs are distributed throughout the whole body thus affecting both, diseased and healthy cells. Current strategies on targeted drug delivery are mainly based on the applications of antibody-drug conjugates or nanoparticles. However, both approaches revealed considerable challenges in their application due to short half-life and expensive production, respectively. We develop a novel platform for targeted drug delivery by implementing highly specific nanobodies directed against surface markers of affected cells. The combination with an enzymatic functionality facilitates the local activation of prodrugs, thus preventing unnecessary side effects by systemic drug dispersal. By engineering the spores of probiotic Bacillus subtilis, a member of the human microbiome, we establish a low-cost carrier for well-tolerated treatment.

Currently there are only electrochemical detectors that sense the presence of this gas, however, we propose a biological detector that is easy to use, it has sensors based on promoters that detect levels of CO, features from the R.rubrum proteobacteria, which makes use of carbon monoxide as its main energy source. Through synthetic biology is possible to transfer these characteristics to other organisms such as E. coli, which in nature has no connection and the transfer of its genetic information is incompatible with this, allowing for innovative advances in scientific applications such as the generation of a biological CO detector to later incorporate this system into an accessory.
https://teams.igem.org/2116	Diagnostics	Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) results in chronic inflammation of the intestines. Current diagnostic methods are invasive and rely on biomarkers that are not sufficiently disease-specific. We have engineered <i>E. coli</i> to detect several disease-specific biomarkers, memorize this event, and allow specific readout of the memory state. While the sensor cells travel through the gut, simultaneously occurring signals are memorized by activating an AND gate which triggers a recombination-based unidirectional switch and commits the observation to memory. After isolation from the patient’s faeces, the memory can be read out through the expression of a fluorescent protein induced by the addition of the candidate biomarker. Thus a single fluorescent protein can differentiate between many different candidate markers. A community of sensor cells can be utilized at the same time, enabling a high degree of multiplexing. Pavlov’s Coli is a non-invasive diagnostic tool for a large selection of specific biomarkers associated with IBD.
https://teams.igem.org/2117	Manufacturing	We are currently consuming resources faster than our planet can replenish them, thus it is obvious that we need to rethink resource efficiency in the future. In order to achieve high resource efficiency in biotechnology, the employment of sustainable substrates in industrial processes is imperative. Due to recent developments in biotechnology, it is now both possible and desirable to use non-conventional chassis, rather than relying on traditional organisms. We propose using the yeast Yarrowia Lipolytica as an alternative chassis, as it has an unusually broad substrate range as well as great potential for the production of both proteins and metabolic products. Due to the limited tools available, thus far the use of Y. lipolytica has been limited to research. Our project aims to develop both molecular and bioinformatic tools for Y. lipolytica, in order to introduce the organism as an advantageous chassis for future bio-refineries.

This probiotic will consist on polyamine auxotrophic bacteria, extracted from the intestinal human microflora, that will contain specific enzymes also found in our body. Additionally, we have planned to develop a cancer risk detector by engineering a bacterial cell and developing a reactive strip that, in contact with urine, can test the risk of having a growing tumor. The principle behind this idea is that an acetylated version of polyamines are exported to the blood and later to urine.

In this investigation we propose the genetic modification of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a lignin degradative organism at contact with the cellulose which we can accomplish with a gene called Lignin Peroxidase, an enzyme that oxidizes substructures not phenolic of the lignin, removing an electron from this and generating cationic radicals which are attacked enzymatically, in this way in order to produce a biological bleaching method that allows reducing contaminants residues from the paper industry.
https://teams.igem.org/2120	New Application	Genetic engineering bacteria have revolutionized human society and one of the most commonly used vectors are plasmids. However, the plasmid as a powerful tool has some natural limits like the segregational instability which may cause the change of population structure. This year our project aims to prove a new concept of plasmid quorum sensing which can be applied to control the plasmid numbers quantitatively and preventing the losing of recombinant plasmids in the same time. Compared with the traditional methods like using antibiotics or auxotrophic bacteria, our project can be more intelligent and controllable. In response to the inhibitor protein which is used as the signal indicating the plasmid numbers, the killer system will be turned on or off. According to our design, E.coli containing less plasmids than the threshold that has been set theoretically will be defined as slackers, and they be killed to optimize the population structure.
https://teams.igem.org/2121	Foundational Advance	Multiplex automated genome engineering (MAGE) is a genetic engineering technique that increases genetic diversity by introducing synthetic oligonucleotides. Two strains of rhizobia were chosen to provide a framework for implementing MAGE in non-model organisms. To optimize MAGE in Rhizobium tropici and Sinorhizobium meliloti, several experiments were conducted, including characterizing the activity of pORTMAGE-3 in rhizobia. Current data indicates the successful transformation and stability of pORTMAGE-3 in rhizobia. To improve how oligonucleotides are stabilized during MAGE, a second experiment consisted of characterizing a library of beta-homologous recombinases to find a beta protein optimized for rhizobia. Synthetic entry vectors carrying each of the rhizobium-specific recombinases are currently being constructed. A third experiment is to characterize a library of inducible promoters hypothesized to be compatible with rhizobia and a set of Anderson promoters. These promoters are being characterized using a citrine fluorescent assay to determine the most suitable promoter strength when performing MAGE.
https://teams.igem.org/2122	WIKI	In many developing countries people depend on reasonably priced and conveniently available street food. However, lack of action taken by governments to regulate street food vendors has lead to the prevalence of severe street food-related illnesses. One of the primary microbial contaminants in street food is E. coli O157:H7, which acts by secreting Shiga-like toxin (SLT). Currently, there is no detection method for SLT outside of a lab setting, thus putting the consumers of street foods at risk. Our project aims to develop a portable, consumer-focused device to detect the presence of SLT in foods. Our device focuses on detecting the interaction between the Gb3 receptor, produced by E. coli Gb3 synthase, and the non-toxic component of SLT, Subunit B. The performance of SDS-PAGE will allow consumers to compare the migration patterns of Subunit B crosslinked with Gb3 to positive and negative controls and identify the presence of SLT.

https://teams.igem.org/2124	High School	Blood clotting is controlled by a highly regulated pathway that attempts to ensure a balance between clotted and unclotted blood within a wound. As a response to trauma, enzymes in the pathway activate sequentially to convert fibrinogen into fibrin.The fibrin strands cross-link together to form a polymer mesh that causes blood flow to slow and eventually cease at the wound site. However, without external intervention the natural clotting process is too slow to prevent excessive hemorrhage and death when bleeding is severe. Proteins in some snake venoms have the ability to act as thrombin analogues and induce the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin at an accelerated rate, bypassing the regulatory pathway. The increased concentration of fibrin causes clots to form quickly within the bloodstream. Our goal is to utilize recombinant protein from Cerastes cerastes venom to prevent fatal hemorrhage and minimize thrombosis in cases of traumatic injury.
https://teams.igem.org/2125	WIKI	Currently, the biotechnologically relevant model strain of cyanobacteria, Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, lacks resilience to cold temperature perturbations. If large-scale operations for photosynthetic production of industrial compounds are to be realized, robustness to unpredictable weather conditions must be considered. Two complementary approaches are being proposed to increase cold adaptation and resistance to freezing in S. elongatus. Previously, it was shown the expression of lipid desaturase desA increases the cold-growth tolerance of S. elongatus. We now aim to improve this range by fine-tuning the expression of a riboswitch-controlled desA. We also hypothesize that introduction of SFR2 from Arabidopsis thaliana—responsible for remodeling the outer chloroplast membrane for increased freezing tolerance—will increase cellular viability to freezing events. Through this two-pronged approach, we aspire to engineer a cyanobacterial strain that ultimately could be used for the production of industrially-relevant products in unreliable environment conditions.

https://teams.igem.org/2127	Village	Our project seeks to manufacture nanostructures. By bridging the two opposite approaches together we have devised a method to create a modular nanowires. With DNA Origami, self assembling properties organize the DNA strand into patterns by using the local forces to find the lowest energy configuration, which is an Bottom-Up approach. To fold the DNA strand into a well defined structure using DNA staples is an example of Top-Down approach. DNA has many advantages over traditional materials such as biological compatibility, low manufacturing cost and the information regarding shape and size is carried over upon replication. Individual modules are 30-40 nm long 3D Structures with hollow cavity that acts as scaffold for the Gold nanowires. They self assemble into long nanowires and we attached photosystem II protein from the Synechocystis 6803 at one end of the wire to create a high efficiency machinery to harvest solar energy.
https://teams.igem.org/2128	WIKI	Tardigrades, also known as water bears, survive extreme cold and dry conditions through an ability known as cryptobiosis. This process is mediated by a class of intrinsically disordered proteins called the Late Embryonic Abundant (LEA) proteins that become ordered when desiccated, thereby stabilizing DNA and protein cell components. Our team expressed tardigrade proteins in E. coli to investigate their utility as stabilizing agents for biological products, including live cells and purified proteins. Additionally, tardigrades have several properties like small size, transparent bodies, and constant cell number that make them a promising model for the study of developmental processes. To test their genetic tractability for use in such a model, we generated a CRISPR protocol for both knocking out tardigrade genes and heterologously expressing non-tardigrade genes within the tardigrade genome. Overall, our results show promise for the study of tardigrades for their resilience and developmental processes.
https://teams.igem.org/2129	Manufacturing	Bacterial Microcompartments (BMCs) are naturally occurring, protein-based containers within bacteria that sequester enzymes for particular reaction pathways. BMCs have numerous potential applications, including increasing flux of desired reactions or as targeted drug delivery vehicles. We have re-engineered the ethanolamine utilization BMC with a light inducible open/close switch by introducing the non-canonical amino acid azobenzene into the coat protein of the compartment, enabling the BMC to switch conformation upon light induction. Structural modeling combined with site-directed mutagenesis enabled predictive placement of azobenzene within the structure to induce large-scale rearrangements of the protein shell that allows the compartment to break apart and re-form in response to a “light switch”. This work expands the synthetic biology toolkit by presenting an outline for the engineering of synthetic BMCs that respond to external stimuli, enabling future biologists to utilize these compartments for controlled synthetic reactions.
https://teams.igem.org/2130	Measurement	Our project this summer aims to improve the CRISPR/Cas9 Tool Box for genome engineering and regulation. The Cas9/Cpf1 protein is widely adopted for it’s easy programmability to generate a targeted double strand break. The cell’s repair machinery would then mend the breaks which allows us to make edits to the DNA. To date, several question regarding this technology have been left unanswered. Firstly, despite the variety of Cas9/Cpf1 protein discovered, we still do not know the efficiency of each protein when compared to each other. Furthermore, the cutting efficiency for different cut sites varies. The populaity of this technology come from it's ability to enhance the rate of knock-ins. However, it's efficiency still remains to be improved as efficiencies varied between target sites. <br><br> The goal for our team is to make a thorough comparison among different Cas9 proteins and improve it's efficiency in genomic editing.

https://teams.igem.org/2132	Village	The biofilm bacteria live in is often a nasty element in many areas such as bio-fermentation industry and waste treatment, since the tangled biofilm usually coheres to surfaces rather firmly. However, its tight cohesion can be exploited as an immobilization platform for biological interactions. Our project chooses CsgA, the self-assembling monomer of the curli fiber in E. Coli biofilm to immobilize quantum dots and hydrogenase. Quantum dots transform photons into electrons, which is consumed by hydrogenase to produce hydrogen. To realize the platform, we add tags, Spy-catcher and His-tag to the CsgA subunit, and Spy-tag to hydrogenase. The Spy system creates binding between the biofilm and the enzyme, while the His-tag on the biofilm binds quantum dots. The tangled biofilm builds the proximity that the two parts need to interact. Furthermore, in terms of efficiency, we established different variations of the system to find the most suitable enzyme-semiconductor hybrid network.

https://teams.igem.org/2134	Software	For biologists, it is quite frustrating to find suitable BioBricks and collect useful genetic information in large volumes of literature. Now with BioDesigner Coral, biologists can search BioBricks, design with the help of recommendations and obtain genetic information of BioBricks in a more comprehensive way. It can analyze user’s design, then give recommendations about parts they may need. Through analysis of massive literature, we find useful information about genes, BioBricks, and the relations between genes. All genetic information will be exhibited in a network graph through visualization method to help users understand and use them better. Clicking on the nodes in the network, which represent genes or BioBricks, users can obtain relatively accurate information about related genes, corresponding protein, and relevant literature. We hope BioDesigner Coral can relieve the arduous work in labs and give inspirations to synthetic biologists.
https://teams.igem.org/2135	Environment	The Nitrogen Project, of which this iGEM team is a part, seeks to drastically reduce the quantity of nitrogen-based fertilizers used in agriculture. Soluble nitrates can “runoff” into water systems with environmental consequences such as algal blooms and human illnesses like methemoglobinemia. If nitrogenase, the enzyme in soil bacteria that “fixes” nitrogen gas into usable nitrates, can be inserted into plants, it would eliminate the need for artificial fertilization. Before this can be done, nitrogenase must first be expressed non-diazotrophic bacteria like E. coli. For proper expression, however, E. coli must have an excess of intracellular ATP and reduced electron donors. We worked to overexpress glycolytic kinases to increase ATP production and overexpress native and foreign electron donors to produce more reduced electron donors. Besides nitrogenase, however, the intracellular environment of our “super cells” may help produce other recombinant proteins.
https://teams.igem.org/2136	Manufacturing	The objective of this project is to produce a biomaterial for immobilizing proteins initially directed to application on burns, using immobilized enzibiotics. The term enzibiotics" refers to the junction of the words "enzyme" and "antibiotic this is enzymes exhibiting antimicrobian activity. For immobilizing these biomolecules will be used gene recombination techniques, adding the polymerization domains in the enzibiotic molecule, compatible with the spider silk proteins. Both will be produced in recombinant microalgae by nuclear transformation of model microorganism Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The project will be executed by group of undergraduates and graduate students in the context of iGEM. It is expected to achieve spider silk fiber production and its initial characterization for antimicrobial activity and mechanical properties, as well as the productivity evaluation in the proposed system. From these results, we can evaluate the application of this immobilizer in other biotechnological applications such as biotransformation, biosensors, biomaterials and textile industry.
https://teams.igem.org/2137	WIKI	Prions, or “zombie proteins,” are infectious agents that lead to a variety of neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs). They sicken cells by aggregating with each other and prevent proper protein folding leading to cell death from the accumulated damage. We propose a synthetic biology approach to better study prion propagation in the model organism S. cerevisiae. Our system involves inserting a premature stop codon into a protein open reading frame of interest or into dCas9 to respectively overexpress or knock-down protein levels during a [PSI+] response. We use Hsp104, a chaperone protein in S. cerevisiae, to demonstrate that our set-up phenotypically responds to the stop codon readthrough. This research is useful for continuously observing a phenotypic output during prion propagation in yeast and may have implications for helping to identify protein targets for both prevention and treatment of NDDs in the future.
https://teams.igem.org/2138	Foundational Advance	Much like proteins, solitary strands of RNA develop secondary structures due to the bonding between nucleotides which comprise the RNA strand. The secondary structures can inhibit ribosomal binding and translation initiation, preventing synthesis of amino acids and proteins. Through the introduction of heat, the bonds between nucleotides can be separated creating a linear strand of RNA which may be translated. This temperature-controlled gene expression may be used in any variety of applications given further foundational research in quantifying protein production whilst knowing the secondary structure and melting temperatures. To allow for such quantification, synthetic RNA sequences of known secondary structure and corresponding melting temperatures will be ligated upstream of reporter fluorescent and chromaprotein genes. The varying levels of color or fluorescence expression based on the temperature of the studied cells will be used to create mathematical models for future use of RNA thermometers.
https://teams.igem.org/2139	Manufacturing	Petroleum-derived chemicals are used as building blocks for a variety of products used in daily life, and while critical, their overuse has had significant negative environmental and societal impacts on the world. Finding alternatives to petro-chemicals is highly desired as we transition to renewable sources. Lignocellulosic biomass represents a sustainable feedstock for energy, chemical, and material production. However, efficient deconstruction and valorization of biomass remains a hindrance to its utilization in next generation biorefineries. To harvest the fermentable sugars and aromatics in plant biomass, a consolidated bioprocessing approach is currently needed to provide a cost effective and efficient scheme for funneling lignocellulose into high-value biochemicals. Here, we have constructed a microbial community of E.coli and Caulobacter crescentus, both synergizing in the degradation of biomass through the display of biomass transforming enzymes on the S-layer of C.crescentus; and the funneling of fermentable sugars and transformed aromatics into high-value biochemicals through E.coli.
https://teams.igem.org/2140	Manufacturing	Our project, StarScaffold, builds on the work of the 2014 Melbourne iGEM team on star-like peptides, a special type of protein backbone with 4 arms. Star-like peptides are an existing concept and have been demonstrated experimentally to have potential uses in augmenting enzyme reaction kinetics and improving performance of antimicrobial peptides. We aim to improve and optimise the design, primarily with the addition of split inteins. These are a special type of protein sequence which allow each arm of the peptide to be ligated to another protein of choice, which could be an enzyme or even other StarScaffold units. We are focusing primarily on two main applications for the StarScaffold; as a hydrogel with uniquely customisable physical and biochemical properties, and as a method of improving enzyme reaction kinetics. These technologies are currently growing in popularity and we hope our project can help improve the current state of the science.
https://teams.igem.org/2141	Diagnostics	Illegal usage of narcotics is one of the worst enemies of society. Throughout the world, many people are suffering from the short and long term effects of these drugs, and the incidence of drug abuse is growing year by year. Among these drugs, methamphetamine (METH) has an increasing role, as also stated in United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reports. As iGEMers from Istanbul Technical University, we believe that solving this world-wide problem is strongly related with the design and production of fast, precise and cheap detection technologies. With that in mind, we are in the process of constructing a fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) based whole-cell biosensor for the detection of METH-based drugs using anti-METH single-chain variable-fragment (ScFv) and fluorescent proteins. We also conducted molecular dynamic simulations with different molecules to verify our designs and planning to use simulation data to complete our biosensor.

https://teams.igem.org/2143	Diagnostics	An active Tuberculosis infection causes various volatile organic compounds (VOC) to be produced. One VOC is 1-Methylnapthlene which can be broken down and used to activate the Naphthalene Regulator transcription factor (NahR) native to Pseudomonas putida. Using two mutants of NahR we can produce a sensitive switch with a positive feedback loop ensuring small traces of VOC found in the breath can be detected. Our device consists of four parts. The Degrader, an operon which breaks 1-Methylnapthelene into 3-Methlysalicylate. The Detector, which contains NahR and Psal, a promoter requiring NahR and 3-Methylsalicylate for activation. The Degrader and Detector work in conjunction to turn on the production of the next two parts. The Feedback loop codes for a mutant of NahR that can activate Psal alone. Lastly, the Reporter produces tyrptophanase which in the presence of enzymes from the Degrader will produce indigo, an insoluble dye compound.

Current treatments rely heavily on antibiotics and debridement of the wound’s biofilm which have proven to be ineffective and contribute to widespread antibiotic resistance. iGEM Team Stockholm 2016 aims to tackle these issues with a novel spider-silk-based wound healing technology. Spider silk, a biodegradable and non-immunogenic material, will serve as a scaffold for attachment of anti-microbial ‘combat enzymes’. They will be conjugated to the silk using a transpeptidase - Sortase A - and are intended to target key components of the biofilm formed by Staphylococcus aureus on wound surfaces. With this multi-targeted approach, we hope to develop a proof-of-concept system for the management of chronic wounds, envisioning future adaptations for a variety of medical and non-medical applications.
https://teams.igem.org/2145	WIKI	Construction of complex circuits is still hampered by ignorance of fundamental principles of genetic circuit design. One key challenge is the isolation of independent genetic components -- genes expressed on the same plasmid (or other DNA molecule) will often unexpectedly interfere with or enhance each others' expression in an orientation-dependent fashion, even if they are nominally isolated by terminators and other motifs. This form of cross-talk may be caused by supercoiling generated during transcription, which has been shown to enhance or repress gene expression depending on the form of supercoiling. To test this hypothesis, we will test whether base pair spacing, terminators, or DNA clamps" (made from DNA-binding proteins) placed between genes on a plasmid can eliminate their cross-talk. If DNA clamps do isolate nearby transcriptional units then those clamps may advance the field of synthetic biology by allowing bioengineers to build more predictable genetic circuitry."
https://teams.igem.org/2146	Foundational Advance	Since its discovery in 1928, bacterial transformation has had a colossal impact on the realm of genetic engineering. Today, the bacterium Escherichia coli remains the model organism in molecular biology. Due to the need for expensive equipment, work is limited to well-funded laboratories. To address this issue and extend research to modestly-funded settings, we propose Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 as an alternative vehicle that harnesses E. coli’s transformative powers while obviating the need for costly apparatus. A reporter gene, E. coli gusA was ligated into each of our shuttle vectors; the ligation mixtures were used to transform A. baylyi. Transformed cells formed blue colonies on media containing histochemical substrate X-gluc, indicating that A. baylyi can be used instead of E. coli particularly when refrigerated centrifuges and ultra-cold freezers are unavailable. We hope our findings can enable genetic engineering in modestly-funded laboratories and bring more diversity to the field of synthetic biology.

Due to their small size, conotoxins could be easily aerosolized and could be used as biological weapons of mass destruction. Our goal of this project has two components. The first is to create a program to mathematically model both normal and conotoxin-affected intracellular ion concentrations. The second is to develop a signaling and responding pathway to detect changes in membrane potential and eliminate the conotoxins.
https://teams.igem.org/2148	Foundational Advance	As the factory floor of the plant cell, the chloroplast can be engineered to produce many important compounds, such as biofuels and vaccine antigens, with yields approximately 50X greater than the rest of the cell. However, little of this potential has been exploited, in the absence of a time-efficient chloroplast transformation protocol. Using the alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii as our chassis, our transformation toolbox aims to shift the focus of plant engineering, by reducing the time needed for a homoplasmic chloroplast transformation from months to 1-2 weeks. We have created a library of Chlamydomonas-optimised parts in the Phytobrick standard, with a view to expressing Cas9 in the Chlamydomonas chloroplast for the first time. We hope to use it to propagate genetic modifications among all copies of the chloroplast genome, within a single generation. We will also develop a low-cost, open source Chlamydomonas growth facility and gene gun to complement our protocol.
https://teams.igem.org/2149	Energy	This project focuses on the production of alkanes with an E. coli resistant to fatty acid. Alkanes are key components of petroleum diesel, however, biodiesel molecules produced by transesterification are oxygen-rich and combustion of these esters cause malfunction and corrosion in regular engines. The development of a biodiesel free of oxygen chemically similar to the petroleum based fuel is essential to expand the lifetime of engines using the concept of drop-in. A membrane resistant to fatty acids is important for using vegetal oils as the source material and this resistance will be provided by tocopherol.

https://teams.igem.org/2150	Environment	The discovery and mass production of antibiotics has saved the life of hundreds of millions of people. However, antibiotic residues in nature and industrial products put people under exposure to varied antibiotics on a daily basis. The impact of such exposure is yet unclear, but some researches have shed light on its role in antibiotic resistance or obesity. UCAS iGEM is devoted to degrading antibiotic residues in exhausted water in waste water treatment plants(WWTPs) or hospitals. We mainly focuses on tetracycline, which is one of the most abundant antibiotic detected in Chinese city rivers. Screen of enzymes including TetX makes the system MORE EFFICIENT, whilst the design of a sensor with a positive feedback and a TA module-based kill-switch makes the system SAFER and SMARTER. Our engineered bacteria will not express degrading enzymes unless antibiotic is presented, and it effectively kills itself after leaking into wrong places.

To combat this deficiency, our project aims to create a yogurt enriched with β-carotene, a precursor to vitamin A. We will insert the required genes to produce β-carotene (four crt genes with a promoter) into S. thermophilus, a lactic acid bacteria used in natural yogurt. We also aim to better characterise S. thermophilus to facilitate its use in synthetic biology. Our conversations with different stakeholders have led us to design a self-inactivating mechanism to ensure the modified bacteria do not survive in the human GI tract. These interactions also encouraged us to create a piece of accessible hardware to enable people in countries most affected by vitamin A deficiency to manufacture their own yogurt from a starter culture.

Hereby, we intend to create a magic agent Gutrio （a combination of GUT and the adventurer MARIO) which will lock on targets, adjust its weapon type and even call reinforcements in order to accomplish its mission. Be specific, we take inflammatory bowel disease as an example, and create an biological agent that is capable of a series of manipulated action, including detection, quorum sensing, healing and terminating themselves after the mission. Then we will send Agent Gutrio to start a remedial journey in fighting human bowel disease. We may shield this agent with designed ‘warship’ if necessary. The molecular bullet in our demo is epidermal growth factor as well as a combination of these molecules and biofilms. We hope this novel approach will be efficient for treating IBD and can be applied as a platform for treating other diseases as well.

In Nova Scotia, softwood waste from the lumber industry is an untapped source for low-cost biofuel feedstock; however, this waste cannot be utilized by traditional biofuel processes due to toxic compounds such as turpentines and unavailable carbon compounds such as cellulose. The porcupine microbiome provides a unique solution as it is capable of digesting bark and toxic products. Working with Schubenacadie Wildlife Park, we aim to not only identify cellulose and/or turpentine-degrading bacteria in the porcupine microbiome, but to also characterize microbial communities found within the Park’s mammal population. To achieve these goals, we are using fecal samples to construct a DNA library of the porcupine and to analyze each mammal’s microbial rRNA. Future experiments include introducing identified cellulose and/or turpentine-degrading pathways into E. coli to produce an economically viable and sustainable biofuel-generating organism.

Spider silk cultivation being a very slow and cumbersome process, we came up with an idea aiming at synthesizing recombinant spider silk protein (MaSp2) and producing it extracellularly in our model bacteria E. coli. Ensuring that the protein is secreted, we can change the nature of the production process from batch to continuous by reusing immobilised cells, and even use it for mass production. We aim at making two constructs for expressing silk outside the cell. We also aim at developing a novel detection system using FRET dye pairs.

Our project aims to reduce the amount of time and effort needed to maintain cultures through the creation of an affordable image analysis system that autonomously reads visual data to measure the current state of a culture and then determines whether to release inducer chemicals based on user input. Our project utilizes the violacein pathway to simulate other metabolic pathways with colored signals. By regulating gene expression in this gene set with two different inducible promoters, we are able to yield up to four different color outputs. These outputs are then measured by an open-sourced Raspberry Pi setup, which captures visual data via camera, measures the culture’s RGB value, and then directs the gradual release of inducer chemicals to maintain or change the culture’s color over time.

A further advantage of using a species native to the skin microbiome would be to ensure the organism was capable of thriving on the target part of the skin. Should a microbe be engineered to overproduce and export proteins that might be used in a therapeutic fashion, the system could be a a boon to those injured in remote and austere environments. Further, the proteins would keep being produced as long as the engineered microbes survived.
https://teams.igem.org/2168	Manufacturing	Bio-manufacturing commonly involves the culturing of genetically engineered microbes that produce product(s) of interest which is followed by separation of the microbes from the growth media and finally isolation and purification of the product(s). The infrastructure and running costs for the downstream processing are significant obstacles to the large scale adoption of bio-manufacturing especially for small-scale start-ups that drive innovation. We have therefore developed a modular set of tools by designing BioBricks<span style="font-size:7pt"><sup>TM</sup></span> for <i>E. coli</i> that firstly cause programmed induction of product synthesis upon reaching a certain tuneable population of cells and secondly autoaggregate the cells upon utilization of most of the nutrients available; these eliminate external induction and centrifugation thereby minimizing costs. This is of special importance in India where financial constraints often bottleneck entrepreneurial efforts in biotechnology which is still a field in the early stages of its development.
https://teams.igem.org/2169	Energy	As renewable, but ecologically and biologically unobjectionable energy becomes more and more important, we decided to prepare semiconducting biofilms for solar cell application. Curli fibers constitute the key element serving as scaffold for the growth and stabilization of ZnO/TiO2 nanoparticles along these wires. We worked on optimization of the structure and thickness of the hybrid layers. To this initial system, absorbing molecules such as organic dyes and fluorescent proteins are applied to expand the spectral range. The result of our research may pave the way to a novel class of solar panels mainly fabricated by living cells, which can lower the overall costs.
https://teams.igem.org/2170	Manufacturing	Living in an aging society and facing the increasing organ shortage, we have developed a game-changing approach to bioprint tissues for biomedical application. Our interdisciplinary work entails creating a novel bioink that exploits the rapid and specific interaction of biotin and its tetrameric binding protein streptavidin. By employing this affinity, we have engineered cells presenting biotin moieties or biotin binding proteins on their surfaces and recombinant biotinylated proteins as spacer molecules, which both co-polymerize upon contact with streptavidin. Furthermore, we have explored different cellular circuits, which allow us to control pancreatic cell lines, induce tissue vascularization, or install biosafety mechanisms for printed tissues. To deliver these cells, we employ a hijacked 3D printer that enables us to manufacture three-dimensional multi-cellular structures in a user-definable manner. Altogether, we are confident that our system provides the necessary means to advance the SynBio community to the next level – the tissue level.
https://teams.igem.org/2171	Food & Nutrition	Production and exportation of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. Bulgaricus as a lyophilized substance is a major activity in the Bulgarian economy. In our project we are developing a novel strain of L. bulgaricus, which is capable of withstanding desiccation and freezing. To achieve that we are introducing exogenous proteins responsible for survival of harsh conditions under the control of inducible promotors. For example, we will utilize IDP’s and LEA proteins from tardigrade responsible for the notorious capacity of that organism to sustain dryness. As another option, we envision to test trehalose production as a method to increase survival rate during lyophilization. Additionally, we will also apply expression of spider silk genes, known for their capacity to improve the capacity of organisms to withstand extreme conditions. For better control and reduction of expression loading of the chassis, we shall utilize inducible promotor such as PLux or PBAD.
https://teams.igem.org/2172	WIKI	Tanshinone is an important pharmacologic chemical extracted from Salvia miltiorrhiza, a famous Chinese medicinal herb. It was reported that tanshinone can effectively cure Cardiovascular diseases. However, content of tanshinone in Salvia miltiorrhiza and its extraction efficiency are very low. Therefore, synthetic biology becomes the ideal way to produce tanshinone artificially. However, until now, the biosynthesis pathway of tanshinone is not clear. In this research, we aimed to produce one of the key enzymes copalyl diphosphate synthase 1 (SmCPS1) which initiate biosynthesis of tanshinone by building up a gene circuit in plasmid of E.coli. Our gene circuit contains a GST for purification of SmCPS1, a thrombin protease site, our target gene SmCPS1 and the reporter gene GFP. Successful biosynthesis of SmCPS1 will lead the way of biological synthesis of all the enzymes in synthesis of tanshinone, accelerate tanshinone production by fermentation, increase its yield and lower the cost effectively.
https://teams.igem.org/2173	Foundational Advance	We aim to construct an oscillator which is a modification of a regular two component oscillator as given by Danino et al. Our project involves modifying this oscillator to make it optogenetically tunable. Once this system is shined upon by green light of wavelength 550nm, it causes a change in the frequency of the oscillations of this Danino oscillator. This de novo oscillator is more robust, and it’s oscillations sychronise spatially over a shorter period of time, and has the advantage of being highly specificly tunable, due to it’s non invasive and non – chemical based induction via light. This is also the first optogenetically controlled oscillator, apart from being a great new tool in the arsenal of synthetic biology, can have a wide range of applications ranging from time based drug delivery, to study correlation of genes, and to create analogues of memory storage in the two different states.
https://teams.igem.org/2175	Environment	In the world, a desertification is one of serious environment problem. A desertification is caused by the loss of a plants that cover the ground and of the water-holding capacity of a soil. To prevent this problem, our team use Bacteria Cellulose (BC) that is produced by Gluconacetobacter (Komagataeibacter). This cellulose produced by microorganism is known as a raw materials of nata de coco and as having high water-holding capacity. We will utilize this high water-holding capacity for prevention of soil erosion. Our object is to improve producing ability of Guluconacetobacter by antisense method. We would like to prevent a soil erosion by increasing of water-holding capacity of soil with use of the improved microorganism.
https://teams.igem.org/2176	WIKI	Disrupted circadian timing plays a role in many human diseases, yet designing interventions that specifically target circadian malfunction remains a challenge. It may be possible to restore circadian timing in animals transgenically using an oscillator network based on the KaiABC system, which consists of three core proteins that generate a 24-hour circadian clock endogenous to the cyanobacterium Synechocococcus elongatus. The Kai oscillator can be reconstituted in vitro with purified proteins, motivating a previous study to transplant it into E. coli (Chen et al, 2014). Successfully transplanting this dynamic system from prokaryotes to eukaryotes would represent an important step towards potential therapeutic treatment. Therefore, as a proof of concept, we aim to establish the KaiABC system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We will attempt to drive cyclic expression of GFP and RFP on alternating 12-hour cycles, thus inducing circadian expression of two temporally separated protein products in a non-circadian eukaryotic organism.

https://teams.igem.org/2179	North America	A Martian colony must make efficient use of the planet’s limited resources. This project was inspired by the movie, “The Martian” and by the work of Davila et al (2013- Intl. J. Astrobiol) who proposed that toxic concentrations of perchlorate (ClO4) in Martian soil was a resource that could be exploited as a source of oxygen (O2), while remediating the soil in the process. Here we build on this work and others by: 1) testing the idea that that ClO4 can be highly enriched and concentrated inexpensively by selective ion exchange chromatography, 2) Converting ClO4 to O2 and Cl- using a strain of E. coli that has been engineered to express perchlorate reductase and chlorite dismutase (two enzymes derived from the soil bacterium Ideonella dechloratans) and, 3) developing a method for the conversion of colony bio-waste into a highly enriched media for bacterial growth.
https://teams.igem.org/2180	Environment	Bees are an important part of our daily life. Recently, they became endangered due to the Colony Collapse disorder (CCD) which itself has multiple causes including pesticides, pathogens and pests. Our goal is to modify Bacillus subtilis so it can detect some factors indicating beehives' health. This would allow beekeepers to take early measures to keep beehives healthy, and bee researchers to have an easy way to study CCD with the possibility of studying correlations between multiple factors. We plan to detect a bee pathogen, Paenibacillus larvae, sugar and heavy metals levels in bees through a color detection system. Once we obtain our proof of concept, this detection system could be used to detect additional factors indicating bees’ health by simply interchanging one biobrick to detect a new factor. Eventually, a “reverse API gallery” system could be set up with multiple factors detection using our “Bee subtilis”.

https://teams.igem.org/2182	Energy	The 2016 Northeastern University team focused on two key problems with modern wastewater treatment: the waste of energy and information. Wastewater treatment consumes an enormous amount of energy, yet the water contains a wealth of reduced molecules that go unharvested. Wastewater is also a reservoir of information about the bacterial communities surrounding treatment centers, currently this information is only accessed through metagenomics. To address the waste of potential energy, we designed and investigated multiple plasmids to resolve issues that plague microbial electrolysis cells. We also designed a conjugative Crispr/Cas plasmid with a built in CFP reporter that can be used to monitor wastewater bacteria in a new way. This allows for the real-time detection of specific bacteria of interest as well as the elimination of pathogenic traits.

Endpoint fluorescent image data is acquired on the BioMark™ System for genetic analysis and data is analyzed using the Fluidigm SNP Genotyping Analysis software, to obtain genotype calls. In addition to saliva collection from students volunteering to participate, after completing their phenotypes forms of response to food tastes, we will generate a synthetic DNA harboring the wildtype and mutant alleles (SNP) for the ability to sense taste which will be used as control for the Taqman assays and for preforming CRISPER on the mutant SNP allele, to convert it to the wildtype allele, as a feasibility test to be able to change people's taste sense for several important targets.

Bacteria resistant to antibiotics emerged shortly after their initial use, and is an increasing problem as pathogenic strains of bacteria evolve resistance to multiple drugs. In an effort to increase antibiotic susceptibility, we will use CRISPR/Cas9 technologies to disrupt intrinsic resistance mechanisms in E. coli. Specifically, we plan to enhance the expression of Omp pores while also inhibiting the functioning of AcrAB-TolC efflux pumps. Mechanism for effective delivery of a functioning CRISPR system in clinical settings will be explored.
https://teams.igem.org/2187	Village	Plastics are a waste product that pollutes the environment we live in, and many solutions have been implemented with little long term success, such as Mr. Trashwheel and laws prohibiting the act of littering. Researchers, in 2014, have found a bacterium, known as Ideonella Sakaiensis, that is able degrade poly ethylene terephthalate (PET) plastics entirely using two enzymes. The Baltimore BioCrew wanted to design a bacteria that is able to degrade the plastics in our marine ecosystems at a rapid rate without harming the creatures within it. In order to investigate if this is possible, we obtained the two enzymes used in Ideonella Sakaiensis, PETase and MHETase, and inserted the enzymes into E. coli plasmids. We hope the E. coli bacteria degrades PET plastic within 1-3 weeks and produces a by-product that is benign to organisms and a possible energy source.

https://teams.igem.org/2194	Environment	A recent analysis of Americas drinking water for carcinogenic hexavalent chromium (CrVI) revealed over 218 million Americans consume CrVI at levels exceeding a de minimis lifetime cancer risk. Our team attempted to solve this problem by engineering Shewanella oneidensis to reduce CrVI to its less toxic form (CrIII) in contaminated wastewater. We enhanced reduction via expression of a mutated chromate reductase enzyme (chrR6) and increased chromate permeability via over-expression of sulfate transporter and binding proteins (cysP,U,W,A and sbp). Addressing biocontainment, we included a kill switch where low CrVI levels signaled expression of a toxin (BamHI). Laboratory work has been completed in model organism Escherichia coli; future work includes characterizing the circuit in S. oneidensis. To assess real-world feasibility, we developed bioreactor- and cell-scale simulations of our engineered bacteria in an activated sludge secondary treatment system aimed at determining the kinetics of Cr(VI) remediation and cell death.
https://teams.igem.org/2195	Environment	Due to numerous climate effects, photosynthetic organisms are being damaged due to increased levels of harmful UV-B radiation. Luckily, many organisms exist that have a natural resistance to this kind of radiation. Using genes from the tardigrade species Ramazzottius Varieornatus, the bacteria species Deinococcus Radiodurans, and a strain of cyanobacteria, we hope to induce resistance to UV-B radiation damage. In order to demonstrate proof of these genes’ utility, our first step was to transform the genes into E. Coli. From there, we planned to test these transformed cells in our Environmental Simulation System by irradiating the cells and comparing their growth to that of a control. So far, we have found that E. Coli cells with Dsup are substantially more resistant to UV-B radiation, and we have also recorded preliminary data on uvsE as well. Currently, we are transforming the four genes into cyanobacteria and testing them under UV-B light.
https://teams.igem.org/2196	Therapeutics	MRSA is a prevalent threat due to its high resistance against multiple antibiotics, prompting health professionals to find alternative treatment options. Bacteriocins are ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides produced by bacteria to selectively kill other strains of bacteria in their surrounding environment. Our study involves creating a hybrid of the bacteriocins, Lacticin Z and Aureocin A53 (or Epidermicin NI01) by connecting them with three glycine residues. These bacteriocins have shown effective inhibitory activity against MRSA strains; they form pores to penetrate the membrane of the pathogenic strain. We tested if the hybrid bacteriocins will have a synergistic effect and compared their cytotoxicity over time to that of the individual bacteriocins against MRSA. This was done by conducting two assays: minimum inhibitory concentration and the spot-on-lawn. Through development of hybrids, we aim to optimize the activity of bacteriocins and treat bacterial infections, particularly those with antibiotic resistance.

Gout is formed due to uric acid crystallizes and accumulated at synovial fluid. Thus, we wish to develop a rapid detection method to confirm whether he is suffering from gout by measuring the concentration of uric acid in their blood. The cure or relieve gout by preventing the increase of uric acid concentration to a certain threshold is also in progress. Several parts have been designed to achieve the above goals.

https://teams.igem.org/2198	Environment	Indoor air pollution is a worldwide threat and existing solutions are limited as stated by experts we met. Our aim is to design an air purifying device. Not only will it capture toxic compounds present in the air, but it will also degrade them using enzymes. As a proof of concept, we have chosen Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) as targets, since they are some of the most dangerous volatile air pollutants. The enzymatic pathway we have elaborated will degrade PAHs into pyruvate, a physiological compound. Our system and its coating will not release any GMOs. After meetings and discussions with the general public, health specialists, air quality regulators, law and political actors, we have designed an affordable and user-friendly device, æther. Indeed, it consists of an energetically autonomous DIY kit based on simple materials, so that people with low income and restricted access to electricity can also benefit from it.
https://teams.igem.org/2199	Village	Intercellular communication in biofilm microbial communities is a well-known natural phenomenon. Recently, it has been reported that cells in biofilms may also communicate long distances via ion gradients, mimicking neuronal networks. We believe such electrical communication could be important in pathogenicity of air-borne environmental toxicants if they interfere with natural ion fluxes in the human respiratory microbiome. If a microorganism were engineered to respond to an ionic change, the respiratory microbiome could detect and respond to an environmental toxicant exposure in real-time. Our project will demonstrate a cation responsive genetic sensor by regulating expression of GFP using the sodium responsive transcriptional regulator, NhaR. We will use the ionophore monensin, known to create a change in Na+ equilibrium across the cell membrane, as a proxy to imitate an ionic response within a biofilm. This will ultimately provide bioengineers a method to create alternate probiotic sensors for cell-communication and possibly ion homeostasis.
https://teams.igem.org/2200	High School	Melanoma is the most malignant type of skin cancer with high metastasis potential and a low survival rate. It is reported that about 60% of melanomas contain a mutation in the v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF), and V600E (1799T>A) variation in BRAF is the main type of mutations in the cancer tissues, which plays a critical role in carcinogenesis of melanoma. In our project, we aim to disrupt the mutant BRAF in the two melanoma cell lines (A375 and G361) by CRISPR/Cas9 technology. The data showed that the system significantly inhibited the proliferation and migration, and induced apoptosis in the two cell lines, which suggest that we could target a specific oncogene and achieve personalized therapy for different types of cancer only by simply changing the sequence of a sgRNA.
https://teams.igem.org/2201	Foundational Advance	We are exploring the application of unnatural base pairs as an expansion of the genetic code. To prevent loss of unnatural base pairs during replication, we will utilize several systems including CRISPR/Cas9. The expanded genetic code allows for the ribosomal incorporation of multiple non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs) into peptides. With their broad chemical and functional diversity, ncAAs provide a variety of promising applications including protein labeling, photocaging, structure analysis, and specific protein interactions. Therefore, our innovative toolkit for the translational incorporation of ncAAs in E. coli is a valuable contribution to iGEM. Directed evolution of tRNA/aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase pairs enables the site-specific incorporation of ncAAs into peptides. This approach results in an optimal orthogonality to the autologous translation apparatus and a high flexibility concerning the incorporation of multiple ncAAs. As proof of concept, we are developing a rapid test for prions and a new chromatography method for mild protein elution.

DNA diagnostic nanodevices are produced using the predictable and programmable properties of DNA binding. In our project, we will produce biobricks encoding a 3D nano device which detects diseases, like Huntington's disease and cancers, that produces mRNA biomarkers. The presence of target would induce a conformational change of our nanostructure, which we can be assessed through gel electrophoresis, colorimetric and fluorescence assay. Lastly, we will transform the construct with our biobrick , consisting of our oligos, and reverse transcriptase into E. coli that can facilitate the synthesis of our nanostructure inside the cell. By using E. coli, this will help us to mass produce a diagnostic tool for a specified disease.
https://teams.igem.org/2203	Diagnostics	The emerging field of cell-free synthetic biology promises to significantly improve molecular diagnostics. Cell-free systems for engineering and implementation allows for fast testing cycles, ready-to-use detection devices, better biosafety, as well as cheap and easy transport and storage. Previously, Pardee et al. developed a cell-free system for detecting viral RNA in patients by engineering toehold switches coupled to lacZ for signal generation. Since many clinical tests rely on the detection of protein biomarkers, we developed a novel scheme for detecting proteins by coupling aptamer based affinity reagents to the toehold-switch concept in cell-free system. We furthermore improved on various aspects of the original Pardee cell-free system to create a tool that is more effective, cheaper and easier to use. Because the system can be rapidly engineered and deployed, and all parts can be modified to recognize different protein or RNA molecules, its a highly modular and novel diagnostic tool.
https://teams.igem.org/2204	Village	Research done in the last 50 years or so has forced humanity to reconsider its gluttonous appetite for petrol based products and energy. The effects of this "appetite" have been profound, scientifically undeniable, and perhaps the biggest threat humanity has faced. The answer; synthetic biology. Like any emerging field, synthetic biology is experiencing an explosion of novel methods and ideas. We have focused our efforts on altering the metabolic process of the archaea Thermococcus kodakarensis to produce pragmatic amounts of the well-known terpenoid, limonene. Limonene is of great interest due to its myriad of industrial uses, namely as a biofuel. Usage of an archaeal organism's mevalonate pathway allows for a simple incursion of one extra enzyme (limonene synthase) to convert GPP into limonene. Gas chromatography and western blot methods were used to quantify limonene concentration and detect gene expression respectively, in the altered T. kodakarensis.
https://teams.igem.org/2205	WIKI	Biosensor applications are wide-reaching, but their development is complex, inefficient, and uptake limited. We propose a new foundational paradigm for biosensor development; a modular, multicellular development platform, Sensynova. Biosensor designs were reviewed, identifying design-patterns of commonly used subcomponents and configurations. Separating biosensor subcomponents as modules, in different bacterial cells, promotes off-the-shelf reuse. New sensors are developed simply by mixing proportions of these cells which communicate using small molecules. A synthetic biology dialogue helped derive designs for new modules (adaptors, detectors, processors, and reporters), and a proof-of-concept system. Cell-free, automation, developer requirements, target-specific knowledge, robustness, legislation, and end-user uptake were also investigated.
https://teams.igem.org/2206	High School	Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has a high mortality and no cheap screening test for early diagnosis. MicroRNA (miRNA) levels in body fluids are postulated to be effective, non-invasive biomarkers for many diseases. miRNAs hsa-mir-15b-5p and hsa-mir-27b-3p are differentially expressed in serum early in NSCLC. We designed two sequence specific sensors to quantify serum levels of these miRNAs using toehold switches, which regulate protein synthesis post-transcriptionally. Binding of an arbitrary RNA sequence to the toehold switch activates translation, producing a fluorescent reporter protein. Fluorescence intensity therefore indicates miRNA levels. This may enable miRNA level detection using toehold switches as a simple detection method for NSCLC. In future, we propose multiple switches used in tandem to detect differentially expressed miRNAs in multiple diseases simultaneously, or even several reporters with different emission peaks to create a multiplexing assay. This would allow for rapid and cheap diagnosis of many diseases from one sample.

Trichoderma.atroviride is our selected guardian,we use it as our chassis, making it can respond to specified volatile organic compounds(VOC) and then synthesize new VOC to realize the communication between guardians just like QS in bacteria.We further build a hardware to detect the healthy condition of plants based on machine learning. We also express ferritin and TRPV1 proteins to try to make the guardians respond to medium waves emitted by the hardware when it estimates the plants are attacked, and then our guardians will protect the plants from phytopathogen,nematodes,or even herbivores.We use tobaccos and its nature enemy Phytopathora nicotianae to elaborate our works.
https://teams.igem.org/2208	Therapeutics	Obesity has become increasingly disturbing and common these years. However, a perfect treatment of obesity has not appeared so far. The goal of our project is to develop a strategy to treat obesity, with building a transplantable system targeting a specific molecule that functions in white fat tissue. We packed siRNA into exosomes (nano-sized vesicles secreted by human cells). Then we modified our exosome with a certain peptide to act as white-fat-tissue-specific targeting tool. The siRNA will function to bring out the apoptosis of fat tissue. Our validation experiments will be carried out at the level of cells and animals (mice) to prove both the targeting and function of siRNA. Eventually, we expect to see a specific accumulation of the siRNA in the mices white fat tissue and the decrease of mices fat and their weights. This project may provide new insights into future treatment of obesity.
https://teams.igem.org/2209	High School	The biodegradation solution to toxic substances in the environment has received general consent and considerable attention. Our project aims at the biodegradation of toxic aniline and its compounds (a type of chemical raw material and the intermediate metabolite of aniline herbicides). Currently the spectrum for aniline biodegradation genes is too narrow to effectively recover polluted soil and waterbody environments. Based on previously discovered relevant genes, we attempt to search for crucial genes for aniline degradation in Acinetobacter sp. strain YAA, and perform gene recombination and expression, meanwhile construct recombinant genetic engineering bacteria, and test the bioremediation effects in contaminated waterbodies and soil samples. Results show that recombined target gene could efficiently express in E. coli, and that the engineered bacteria acquired from three-parent hybridization express a wider range of substrate spectrum, thus laying the foundation for further bioremediation research.
https://teams.igem.org/2210	High School	Soil contamination due to crude oil causes environmental and health-related problems. Our project engineers Bacillus subtilis that function as surfactin producing units to remediate contaminated soils. Surfactin is a biosurfactant that can emulsify hydrophobic organic compounds and, in turn, enhance the biodegradation process. To synthesize and export surfactin more efficiently, we overexpress sfp, the 4-phosphopantetheinyl-transferase, and YerP, a surfactin efflux pump. In addition, lmrA, a multidrug resistance transporter from Lactococcus lactis, is mutated and tested for higher surfactin specificity. We want our product to provide a greener and safer alternative to methods such as heat treatment and leaching. Biosurfactants and the introduction of Bacillus subtilis should have fewer impacts on soil microbiome, and should be more effective than relying on bioremediation alone. We hope that our project can contribute to the use of B. subtilis as a chassis in synthetic biology, and explore new methods of utilizing multi-drug resistance factors.

Thus we have developed a web application named BAT(BiobrickAssist Technology) with Node.js. BAT mainly functions as a search and evaluation engine for biobricks. We are aimed to create a platform for researchers to learn and evaluate. Based on our work in 2016, BAT can do evaluation at different levels and evaluate completely new biobricks, and this year we do some optimization for the scoring algorithm. Users may search biobricks by categories, submission time etc. Considering the auto-evaluation may not be perfect all the time, we have been developing a small but useful community like Q/A for users to manually select best biobricks. If a researcher has used a biobrick, he(she) can score it on our site and leave a short comment.
https://teams.igem.org/2212	WIKI	Currently, the biofuel industry uses glucose as feedstock for E. coli. Methods to prevent contamination require expensive process sterilization or excess antibiotics dosage which become ineffective over time by promoting antibiotic resistance. In our project, we use a xenobiotic approach to engineer autotrophic cyanobacteria, Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, to produce the rare sugar D-tagatose in a five-step enzymatic pathway. After detecting tagatose via HPLC, we will seek to engineer a transporter for tagatose secretion, a mechanism that is currently not known. The cyanobacteria will be harnessed in conjunction with genetically engineered E. coli that can metabolize tagatose; by using a multifaceted approach, we could leverage xenobiotic technology in a unique way to create a novel production platform that uses tagatose as a nutrient source and an anti-contamination agent. Because our system utilizes photosynthetic cyanobacteria to cheaply produce the rare sugar carbon source, our co-culture system is both self-sustainable and cost-effective.

However, phosphate runoff from fields often causes eutrophication, leading to the deterioration of aquatic ecosystems. Moreover phosphate rock is a finite and increasingly scarce resource. Together, these two issues suggest a closed-loop solution. IGEM Manchester aims to address this issue using a bioengineered device: Phosphostore, genetically-modified bacteria that accumulate phosphate from wastewater in protein-based microcompartments for future recycling. In interviews with a wide range of stakeholders, we explore the economic and regulatory constraints that would influence the implementation of this system in real-world water treatment plants, as well as utilize a Design of Experiments approach to design a system with the required properties (e.g. the correct shell protein ratios for proper microcompartment formation) that would make our solution feasible on a larger scale.

Finally, the mathematical performance of circuits design will be simulated by our platform.
https://teams.igem.org/2215	Village	Corals are responsible for sustaining a quarter of the ocean’s biodiversity. However, due to natural biochemical processes and human activities, ocean temperatures are rising by 1-2% every year. This results in coral bleaching, the loss or expulsion of zooxanthellae from its tissue, due to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced from photosystem I. ROSs can be converted to less toxic chemicals by superoxide dismutases (SODs), however it does not react as quickly with ROSs as does other chemicals in the cell. Our research aims to reduce the production of ROSs by characterizing three SODs. We will determine which SOD is most efficient based on its placement in the cell under abiotic stresses, such as light and heat. We will also create a chassis for Symbiodinium and construct biobricks for each individual part. In addition, a controlled water tank will be created to simulate environmental conditions.

The illegal practice returning this recycled waste oil back into the food industry can result in the ingestion of unsafe quantities of MDA. Malondialdehyde can be broken down into benign metabolites via the sequential enzymatic action of aldehyde dehydrogenase (specifically mitochondrial ALDH2) and malonic semialdehyde oxidative decarboxylase. The products of the reaction are acetyl-CoA with the release of CO2. We designed a genetic circuit which expresses these two enzymes in equal amounts and is supports the expression system of E.coli, rendering our device useful for the development of a biological treatment system which could form part of standard protocols relating to the treatment of waste oil in industrial oil refinery plants.
https://teams.igem.org/2217	Therapeutics	Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide & ranked first among cancers in males and next to breast cancer among females in Egypt - based upon results of National Cancer Registry Program of Egypt-. "Grabbing the problem from the roots" is the best way to decently describe the use of CRISPR, a special gene editing technique that we will be using to modulate a certain circRNA and adjust its gene expression, which is down-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma. This in consequence modifies miRNA expression thus amending the mRNA gene expression; which is the visible problem in our trials. This will lead us to adopt a novel strategy for miRNA suppression by using circRNAs. This is accomplished by utilizing a synthetic circuit to give rise to a springboard in our battle against cancer.

https://teams.igem.org/2219	High School	DNA is always used a genetic material for information transfer over generations. It's programmability also allows the application in fabricating various objects for diagnostics and therapeutics as the field of DNA nanotechnology. This year, we used DNA to fabricate a three-dimensional cube that is responsive to the presence of H3N2 influenza mRNA biomarker. We used DNA and RNA oligos of the same sequence of the target for detection. From the result, we found that the DNA nanocube specifically responses to the presence of target leading to the opening of the lid. This results in the disassemble of the quadruplex formation and reduction in hemin-mediated peroxidase activity. We proved that a three-dimensional nanodevice can be used for quick diagnosis within 30 minutes and it is applicable for the detection of different biomarkers and we wish to largely produce this diagnostic device with engineered bacteria.
https://teams.igem.org/2220	Foundational Advance	Our project aims to improve the loading capacity of yeast surface display system by displaying the microtubules and the flagellar filaments, respectively, onto the yeast surface. To start with, By using the agglutinin system, we anchored subunits of fibrous polymers which are represented here by microtubulin subunits or FilC, on the cell wall of yeast. Since the particular polymers self-assembly can take place outside cell membrane, we provide the engineered yeast with an environment rich of pre-secreted polymers subunits. In this way, an extracellular tridimensional display system could be formed, which can enlarge the loading capacity by roughly an order of magnitudes. Moreover, we remodify the structure of FliC, substituting its D3 domain by the particular enzyme. By means of display and assemble specific combination of FilC-enzymes, the co-display ability can be greatly enhanced. As a result, a highly efficient, whole-cell biocatalyst system would be established at the meantime.
https://teams.igem.org/2221	Energy	During industrial production of alcohols, large-scale bacterial fermentation is often used to yield more product. However, when the alcohol level in the growth medium nears the toxic concentration for the bacteria, the bacteria will start to break down the alcohol they have created. Therefore, the toxic threshold determines the maximum alcohol production. This year, we have started a new project to increase alcohol resistance in bacteria, which should also increase the toxic threshold. This, in turn, would allow the bacteria to produce higher concentrations of the desired alcohol. E.coli is a good platform for biofuel production because the pathways to produce alcohols such as ethanol, isobutanol and isopropanol already exist. We plan to clone several genes in E.coli, such as GlmY and GlmZ, that are associated with alcohol resistance.
https://teams.igem.org/2222	Diagnostics	Current state-of-the-art inorganic hardware sensors for biological and chemical agent detection are highly tailored for specific chemicals and find difficulty when used to detect compounds outside of a highly defined analyte set. Olfactory receptors are G Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) that discriminate thousands of odorants based on genetic sequences that in the presence of a ligand cause cells to generate an electric potential that is measurable using microelectrode arrays (MEAs). Here, we modify HT-22 cells by adding individual olfactory receptors plasmids via nucleofection. A bioreactor was designed with a peristaltic pump system allowing for media to flow across a MEA cultured with neurons which enables the controlled addition of liquid samples for action potential measurement. Analysis of modified neurons serve as a representative model for exploiting the sensitivity and selectivity of native olfactory systems to be used as rapid detection systems for applications in security and medical & health capacities.
https://teams.igem.org/2223	Manufacturing	Much of the world struggles with inadequate access to essential medicines and nutrition due to high pharmaceutical prices and unreliable distribution. Our solution is to decentralize production of these resources by engineering the robust cyanobacterium, Arthrospira platensis, to produce essential medicines and supplements self-sustainably, photosynthetically, and on-site at healthcare facilities. However, due to insufficient research into the genetics of A. platensis, we have undertaken two separate engineering endeavors in the metabolically similar Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 to produce acetaminophen and human-usable vitamin B12. The genes for acetaminophen production, 4ABH and nhoA, and those for B12 production, ssuE and bluB, have been transformed into PCC 7942 with the aim of method validation and subsequent migration to A. platensis, once a genetic system has been established. In addition, we are performing a whole genome sequencing of A. platensis UTEX 2340 to further this research and its potential medical applications.
https://teams.igem.org/2224	High School	This year, SMS_Shenzhen develops a pesticide mate which can reduce copious quantities of pesticides using and is free from side effects to the environment. Scale insects are pests which threaten agriculture and gardening industry. Because of its harmfulness and tenacity, a large amount of contact pesticide is used yearly to repress its outbreak. In this project, E. coli was applied to selectivity degrade the thick shell of scale insects. Three kinds of enzymes are expressed in E. coli to degrade the chitin, protein and wax shell, which make it possible for pesticide to penetrate the shell. To avoid hurting plantswax-protein surface, a sucrose-induced enzyme release system is introduced, which utilizes the insect's honeydew secretion. Though pests may not be killed directly by E. coli, there is a huge decrease in pesticides needed in the killing process, which saves much money and brings numerous benefits to environment.
https://teams.igem.org/2225	Environment	Decreasing fresh water availability is not only a problem for desert climate regions like North-Africa and the Middle East, but also for European countries like Germany or the Netherlands, where water pollution is mainly caused by industry. We are modifying the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to increase the uptake of various ions into the cell and store these inside its vacuole. This will be achieved by upregulation of native (vacuolar) ion importers and knock-out of ion exporters. Furthermore, we are expressing heterologous genes from the plant Arabidopsis thaliana in yeast to improve vacuolar ion accumulation, thus creating a microbial dustbin. With this newly generated library of genetically engineered yeasts, we hope to offer a novel way of treating water contaminated by industrial processes and store pollutants in our intracellular reservoir, the Salt Vault. Then this concept can be employed by industries facing problems with high pollution in their process water.
https://teams.igem.org/2226	High School	Colorectal cancer is the second most lethal cancer in the United States, often beginning as benign polyps in the colon and rectum. Despite ease of treatment, cases of CRC are usually detected in its late stages, rendering care difficult. CRC results from the mutation of multiple genes involved with the regulation of cell proliferation and DNA repair, with the ASIJ iGEM team focusing on the Wnt pathway. The activation of the Wnt pathway inhibits the degradation of beta-catenin, a protein that triggers the mutation of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Through detection of these mutated genes and subsequent downstream proteins, our team aims to develop an early screening method that can be adapted to a home detection kit. Building off of a rapamycin induced split-luciferase system characterized by the 2015 Peking iGEM team, our construct consists of a promoter reporter system that looks at two downstream products, C-myc and COX-2.

https://teams.igem.org/2228	Therapeutics	Benzene, an inhaled carcinogen linked to leukemia and lymphoma, is found in consumer goods and industrial byproducts. To reduce exposure-related illnesses, we engineered bacteria to degrade benzene into safe metabolites in a nine-enzyme pathway. This prophylactic Benzene REduction THERapy (BREaTHER) may be introduced to the lung microbiome. As proof-of-concept we evaluated the ability of engineered E. coli to degrade benzene via gas chromatography and measured improvements in the benzene tolerance of engineered strains. We also demonstrated that nebulizers can efficiently deliver BREaTHER into the lungs. To define the conditions under which BREaTHER is safe and effective, we developed a mathematical model. We envision BREaTHER using a variety of lung microbes and have designed universal promoters and ribosome binding sites via analysis of various Gram positive and negative bacteria. BREaTHER may one day provide additional protection for concerned individuals and reduce the occupational exposure of high risk workers such as firefighters.
https://teams.igem.org/2229	High School	The small size of nanoparticles is both an advantage and a problem. Their high surface-area-to-volume ratio enables novel medical, industrial, and commercial applications. However, their small size also allows them to evade conventional filtration during water treatment, posing health risks to humans, plants, and aquatic life. Our project aims to remove nanoparticles using two approaches: 1) bind citrate-capped nanoparticles with the membrane protein proteorhodopsin and 2) trap nanoparticles using E. coli biofilm produced by overexpressing two regulators -- OmpR234 and CsgD. We envision integrating our trapping system in both rural and urban wastewater treatment plants to efficiently capture all nanoparticles before treated water is released into the environment.
https://teams.igem.org/2230	High School	According to research, in 2015, about 7 adults in 10 suffer the problem of overweight or even obesity, and it is expected that more people are going to get into this kind of unhealthy problem. One of the most major factors that lead to obesity is sugar, which could be easily found in beverages, dessert, and almost any kind of food. Thus, it is quite difficult not to absorb too much amount of sugar in our daily lives. In hope of preventing our bodies from absorbing too much glucose, our team aims to engineer bacteria that absorb glucose more efficiently. Our team constructed glucose active transporters on the membrane of E.coli, enabling the glucose uptake to become faster than intestine cells. On the other hand, our team has designed a suicide circuit ensuring the bacteria dont absorb all the sugar and the body can get adequate amount of sugar.

https://teams.igem.org/2232	Manufacturing	This year we designed a self-healing system for concrete. When there is a microcrack our system can be switched on and concrete can start to heal themselves. We transfered gerA gene to be our biosensor. When there is liquid L-alanine. GerA receptor can be induced so the whole chain can be started. we improved the alkali resistance by transfer nhaC. We put the spores of our Bacillus subtilis into microcapsules, along with nutrients and L-alanine powder. And mix the microcapsule with concrete. When there is a microcrack, the tension of the wall breaking will also break the microcapsule and the water will infiltrate, after the germination that induced by L-alanine. The Carbonic anhydrase gene that we transfered will let CO2 hydrate to produce CO32-, which then binds with free Ca + in the environment to form calcium carbonate sediment,so the microcracks are filled.The rebars inside won't rust.
https://teams.igem.org/2233	Food & Nutrition	The aim of our project is to create a biosensor for evaluating the concentration of L-theanine. Theanine is an amino acid primarily found in particular plants, especially in tea plant (Camellia sinensis). Theanine boosts alpha brain waves, promoting relaxation. In addition, theanine is one of the taste ingredients of green tea, which is called as umami in Japanese, meaning pleasant savory taste. For these reasons, green tea containing the more theanine is considered to have the higher quality. Currently, the theanine content in green tea is measured by instrumental analysis depending on the expensive equipment. To reduce the cost and special technique required for the measurement, we aimed at developing a bacterial sensor to evaluate the theanine content in green tea based on identification of the genes in Bacillus subtillis that are induced in the presence of theanine.
https://teams.igem.org/2234	WIKI	Cancer is one of the most common and lethal disease in the world and it is always highlighted that early diagnosis is crucial in terms of cancer treatment. It can often be invasive and painful to diagnose cancer and harmful to the body with the existing methods. At this point, breath test appears as a promising non-invasive and real-time technique which allows the monitoring of metabolic status. Volatile organic compounds(VOCs) in the exhaled breath could provide in vitro detection, classification and discrimination of diseases and microorganisms which can alter the metabolic activities of the body. So that, concentration of VOCs in the exhaled breath changes. Due to metabolic changes that cancer causes, concentration of some specific VOCs increases in the breath of patients and our aim is to have bacteria sensed those VOCs to detect four most common cancer types: lung, breast, colorectal and prostate.
https://teams.igem.org/2235	Therapeutics	Until recently, the mucus layer of our lungs has remained unexplored. Many respiratory diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cystic fibrosis are characterized by an excessive accumulation of thick mucus. Afflicted people suffer repeated lung infections and breathing difficulties caused by clogged airways, resulting in severely reduced quality of life. We address this issue by developing an unprecedented probiotic approach that self-regulates mucus thickness to protect and promote respiratory health. Our engineered bacteria sense the pathologically altered osmotic pressure caused by thickened mucus, thus triggering the expression of mucus degrading enzymes. For a proof-of-concept we degrade mucus, envisioning to clear the airways and consequentially remove entrapped pathogens and harmful particles. As pioneers in the field of lung probiotics, we challenge conventional treatments by exploring the lung microbiome as a potential solution to manage mucus-related respiratory diseases.
https://teams.igem.org/2236	Therapeutics	Antibiotic resistance is one of the largest issues facing modern medicine today. Of particular importance is the lethal Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA. We propose to use sRNA-mediated gene silencing as a substitute for antibiotics to target an array of essential genes in MRSA: mecA, secA, glmM, and ddl. First, we identified a dsRNA-binding chaperone, Hfq, which acts to stabilize the sRNA-mRNA duplex in order to recruit RNase III to degrade the dsRNA. We then designed complimentary sRNAs for each mRNA target and tested the affinity of Hfq to our custom designed (AU)7A binding region on the sRNAs using a fluorescence polarization assay. The number of ribonucleotides cleaved from the binding region of Hfq via RNase III was determined via alkaline hydrolysis and long-format PAGE. Finally, Hfq and sRNA were co-transformed on a single vector to test gene knockdown efficiency.

First, we stably express the MtrCAB operon from Shewanella oneidensis, an electric bacterium, in E. coli. MtrCAB is responsible for the production of membrane bound cytochromes and known to generate bacterial nanowires. We anticipate that the MtrCAB system will allow for an electric E. coli that produces nanowire connections between the anode and bacterium for direct electron transfer. Second, we utilize variants of the Aspergillus niger enzyme, glucose oxidase (GOx), that are engineered for stability and affinity to gold (via the addition of thiol fusion tags). Finally, we synthesized a gold nanowire anode to increase the surface area for GOx affinity, bacterial nanowire connections and electron deposition. We envision a system that utilizes each approach concurrently in an effort to increase the electron shuttling of a biofuel cell at the anode.

In order to find an alternative for extracting bile from living Asian black bear, our team works on the biological synthesis of UDCA( Ursodeoxycholic Acid, the effective ingredient of bear bile). By employing CBD(cellulous binding domain) to immobilize enzymes (7&#945;-HSDH, 7&#946;-HSDH, GDH, and LDH) on cellulous, we are able to convert CDCA(Chenodeoxycholic Acid), found in goose bile, into UDCA. Furthermore, we have designed a machine equipped with reaction efficiency measuring system and enzyme-adding controlling system. Our automatic biological synthesis will not only be more efficient but also be cheaper than the tradition extraction and the chemical approach. This approach relieves the pain of patients and the bile bears.
https://teams.igem.org/2240	Village	Unintentional release of genetically engineered organisms (GMOs) has always been a major safety concern in the field of synthetic biology. Different approaches of genetic containment strategy such as kill-switches and auxotrophic mutants pose some issues of horizontal gene transfer of modified genes and metabolic cross-feeding that may limit the effectiveness of those approaches. To circumvent the shortcomings, we present an alternative safety circuit which is capable of sensing and amplifying a signalling molecule under a time-delay mechanism. After the time-delay, the circuit will trigger the production of a recombinase that splices out the genetically modified segment from the origin of replication (ORI) of the carrier vector, thus preventing replication of the genetically modified segment in the host. Through this genetic containment approach, we hope to create a standardized design to lower the risk of leakage of genetically modified materials to the environment and alleviate public concerns.

However, it can’t be scaled up and put into practice so easily mainly due to the unstable productivity. So, to make bio-manufacturing a more practical technology for synthesis, we build up a more stable and efficient synthesis platform based on bio-cathode. There are 3 systems in our project. To enable E.coli to transfer the extracellular electrons into the cytoplasm as NADH, we construct the Mtr CAB system, the first system we have. Mtr CAB, a protein complex located on the outer membrane, can transfer electrons from the outside of the membrane into the periplasm. The second system is a photoelectric system, generating high energy electrons with CdS nanoparticles as a light harvester. Lastly, we introduce an enzyme as an indicator to demonstrate our project’s flexibility and efficiency.
https://teams.igem.org/2243	Information Processing	Complex gene regulation requires responses that depend not only on the current levels of input but also on signals received in the past, enabling temporal variation in cell behavior. In digital circuit theory, this information-processing paradigm refers to sequential logic. We developed recombinase parts that can stably edit DNA sequences and demonstrated their capability of implementing sequential logic in cell. The core of sequential logic is the memory module to store past events. We built a bio-flip-flop with similar function as its electronic counterpart, which can store one bit of memory. By incorporating repressilator into the system, we aim to trigger cell state transition with an intracellular oscillation clock signal. We also developed an automated method to generate genetic sequential logic circuits according to customized specification of inputs and responses in different temporal states, namely the 3D truth table.

We employed a novel light inducible/repressive system that can efficiently overexpress heterogenous hydrolases that are able to degrade chemical pesticides organophosphorus and parathion-methyl residues in soil . By using light control gene expression system, protein products can be produced without the need of using toxic and expensive chemical inducers (i.e. IPTG). In addition, we plan to develop a device that integrates monitoring and data-sharing functions that help applying this system to on-site pesticide residue detection and degradation. We hope to achieve a microbial degradation method with low toxicity, low cost and high efficiency that serve a positive role in maintaining ecological balance and sustaining development in China .
https://teams.igem.org/2245	High School	We are aiming to genetically engineer E.coli to detect iron concentrations in saliva as a biological sensor for iron deficiency and overdose. This would ultimately be developed into a cell-free, paper based system. According to the WHO, it is estimated that 1 billion people worldwide as well as over 50% of pregnant women in LEDCs are iron deficient. Iron supplementation programmes exist in 90 countries worldwide; however, most of these are not systematically monitored, implemented or evaluated. Excess iron supplementation can result in an increased risk of developing chronic conditions such as diabetes and arthritis. Monitoring these conditions requires a time consuming method involving expensive equipment and trained personnel which are difficult to find in LEDCs. Our construct will change colour depending on the iron levels in patients saliva samples. This would make our test inexpensive, unobtrusive and easy to use to help monitor these conditions across the globe.
https://teams.igem.org/2246	New Application	Huanglongbing disease (HLB) is caused by Candidatus liberibacter asiaticus (CLas), a phloem-limited bacteria, transmitted by the Asian citrus psyllid Diaphorina citri (ACP). Current HLB control methods include insecticides and antibiotics that present short-term solutions, that are not specific and may cause a negative impact in plants and the final product. The use of RNAi technology has been widely used in research of gene silencing. Team TEC CEM designed siRNAs targeting four different D. citri genes: Abnormal wing disc (Awd), Wingless (WNT), Superoxide dismutase 1 (CSD1) and Rac-like GTP-binding protein 1 (RacI) to prevent CLas infection and the spread of HLB. RNAi has been proposed as a control mechanism for D. citri, but has only been tested using long dsRNA, therefore we developed siRNAs to maximize the specificity, reducing off-targeting. To ensure effective delivery, siRNAs will be encapsulated using nanotechnology for their direct application to citrus plants.
https://teams.igem.org/2247	Food & Nutrition	We engineered yeasts to be biosensors of aflatoxin (AFT), a carcinogen to human. Often produced by molds when foods decay, AFT is easily found in everyday foods such as grains, oil and milk. However, its detection remains expensive and inconvenient, requiring special equipment. We developed a biosensor of aflatoxin easy for household use which gives a warning of AFT levels beyond safety limit in oil and milk. Utilizing the yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assay, we fused two partial antibodies (single-chain variable fragments) targeting aflatoxin with Y2H elements to drive the expression of the reporter gene in response to AFT. The reporter is a hexose transporter gene linking the level of AFT detected to the concentration of glucose in medium, easily read out by a glucometer. Thus we combine the sensitivity of antibody reaction, flexibility of Y2H assay and convenience of glucometer readout to facilitate household detection of AFT in everyday foods.
https://teams.igem.org/2248	Environment	Arsenic is a toxic chemical that can be naturally occurring or a result of industrial contamination. The identification of dangerous arsenic concentrations in groundwater and soil is important because arsenic poses a serious health risk to living organisms. Unfortunately, arsenic testing is expensive, time consuming, and requires sophisticated equipment. This is especially relevant to soldiers deployed to resource-scarce, field environments. Our team is using synthetic biology to develop a more affordable, portable, and accessible means of testing. We designed a plasmid that uses ArsR, a negative transcriptional repressor, to regulate the expression of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). In the presence of arsenic, ArsR will undergo a conformational change that allows GFP expression. The assay is performed using a low cost paper ticket made by Edgewood Chemical Biological Center and analyzed with ultraviolet light. The development of this circuit would provide an inexpensive way to evaluate arsenic contamination.
https://teams.igem.org/2249	Therapeutics	The ability to control the compartmentalization of enzymes and biologics is needed for drug discovery. Bacterial Microcompartments BMCs are naturally occurring protein structures that act to either sequester harmful metabolic intermediates or concentrate critical cytosolic substrates. Light triggered release of toxic therapeutics from molecular compartments would activate them only where needed and potentially minimize their side effects. We have engineered a BMC with a light activated open/close switch that could be used for drug delivery. We did this by incorporating the light-sensitive compound azobenzene as a non-canonical amino acid into the structure of a BMC coat protein. This allows us to induce the disassembly of the BMC and release its enclosed cargo via photo-stimulation. Our work developing the first light activated BMC expands the synthetic biology toolkit and has the potential to help precisely deliver future therapeutics.

Here we devise an interesting interactive system with E.coli from different sides, with each of them incorporated with functionally independent roles including warrior, farmer and beggar, based on certain gene circuit and the mechanism of quorum sensing. By combining experimenting and modeling, we monitor the ratio and capability of each category of individuals to obtain the factors to facilitate the victory of a group. With our efforts to explore synthetic biology as our tool, more ecological rules will be tested and more stories about inter- and inner-species cooperation and competition will be uncovered. From these, we can have a better understanding at the rules of competition or warfare in the ecosystem as well as in the human society.

It has been demonstrated that functional peptide domains can be fused to the self-polymerizing units of curli to form a variety of functional materials. Thus, curli fibers present a promising platform for the scalable production of programmable materials. Our project focuses on optimizing curli production on two fronts. First, we aim to increase curli export efficiency by optimizing the stoichiometric ratio of proteins involved in the curli pathway. Second, we aim to optimize the conditions for protein-producing cell cultures by growing them in a bioreactor. Our work along these two lines will inform the further development of the curli system as a feasible biosynthetic platform for producing materials at industrially relevant yields.

We will engineer E. coli with a gold specific FRET probe using a donor part which is made up of a gold binding protein (golB) attached to a green fluorescent protein (nowGFP) and an acceptor part made up of golB a red fluorescent protein (mRuby2). In the presence of free gold, the two parts will be in close proximity and thus an energy transfer can take place between the donor and acceptor proteins and the red protein will be excited giving off a fluorescent signal. Using calibration experiments we can relate the amount of fluorescence to the amount the gold present, and liberated by the organism from the ore.

Our project is aimed at designing a probiotic (specifically Lactobacillus plantarum) capable of producing high levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) to treat patients with anxiety and bowel disorders. To make our probiotic overproduce GABA, we intend to overexpress gadB, which encodes glutamate decarboxylase, the enzyme that converts L-glutamate into GABA. Overexpression of gadB will be accomplished by placing it under the control of a Lactococcus lactis constitutive promoter. The efficacy of our probiotic in the human gut will be modeled using the gut of Apis mellifera. Additionally, we have created the Broad Host Range Plasmid Kit, a genetic toolset composed of part plasmids that can be quickly assembled into cassette plasmids, which can then be used to easily genetically modify Lactobacillus plantarum and other non-model organisms.

However, nowadays influenza A subtyping method rely greatly on RT-PCR, which requires long time, expertise and laboratory space. Meanwhile, a novel type of riboswitch, namely toehold switch, shows its potential in subtyping Influenza A with quicker detection and lower production cost.

https://teams.igem.org/2256	Food & Nutrition	Our team wants to make nutritious foods that can be stored for a long time to help people suffering from hunger. Starvation is caused by the fact that not only calories but also nutrients such as protein are short. Therefore, we propose nutritious food that can be stored for a long time by fermentation mainly using fish which is a protein source which does not cost money to raise. We focused on the fermented food called Funazushi which rooted in the area where we live in. We will develop nutritious food by recombining yeast which was dominant species of Funazushi and making yeast produces nutrients lacking in the area. Because Funazushi is high salt concentration and low pH state during fermentation ,we will try to create yeast which make necessary nutrients for nation which is troubled by starvation while have resistance to high salt concentration and low pH.

Traditional methods for detecting them are mainly based on irreversible redox reactions in expensive devices with short life spans, whereas whole-cell bacterial biosensors have major advantages over traditional analyses with regard to specificity, sensitivity and portability. We attempt to develop whole-cell systems detecting these gases. We have managed to transfer gene clusters encoding translational suppressors or activator into E. coli to respond to different gas molecules by up regulation of specific downstream genes. In order to visualize the gases existence and concentration, FP genes are inserted in the expression system after the promoter influenced by the suppressor or activator. At present, results have shown sensibility at a µM level. As long as proper containers are designed, we will be able to construct portable sensors by which users can perform instant on-site monitoring with higher sensitivity, stability but lower costs.

Coupled with transcriptional and translational regulation, copy number control would offer an effective coordination and increased dynamic range of multiple gene expression. Therefore, we modified the ColE1 replicon to develop a synthetic origin of replication - SynORI - which enables the alteration of plasmid copy number. SynORI framework also incorporates a multi-plasmid regulation system based on uniquely barcoded regulatory RNA molecules, allowing to co-maintain different-group plasmids at preselected copy numbers in a standardized manner. In case certain plasmids are chosen to have a low copy number, an active partitioning system will minimize the risk of plasmid loss and increase the stability of our system. SynORI enables the creation of more complex metabolic pathways, smart assembly of protein complexes and a more precise information processing in synthetic biology.
https://teams.igem.org/2260	Manufacturing	Governments and private enterprises alike are gearing up for exploration and colonization of Mars. Two ecological and economical challenges to interplanetary travel arise: the sustainable management of waste produced on a spaceship and the astronomical cost of shipping materials to space. The iGEM Calgary 2017 team used genetically engineered E. coli (expressing genes from Ralstonia eutropha and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) to turn human waste into poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB), a bioplastic. Our engineered E. coli also secrete the PHB they produce, which improves the efficiency of the system. Our project is a start-to-finish integrated system that can be used in space to generate items useful to astronauts during early Mars missions. This will solve the problem of waste management by upcycling solid human waste into a usable product. It will also reduce astronautical costs, as fuel typically used to ship materials to space can be saved.

https://teams.igem.org/2262	Software	In the era of explosive information, the power of using a huge quantity of information is pivotal, so comes in the genesis of Parabase, which integrates A.I. based on Scoring Card Method into databases to achieve drug repurposing by the cross match of collection data and the quick prediction of the unknown in vast data sets. The system can be highly applicable in different topics, and we take fungal diseases for example. We have discovered new antifungal peptides and done experiments to validate their functions. After the antifungal peptides are set, IoT then gathers weather information responsible for the changing situation of reality and tallies out the spore germination prediction model. With the Parabase system composed of Database and IoT, farmers can easily opt for the antifungal peptides to eradicate the pathogens and the exact spraying timing.
https://teams.igem.org/2263	New Application	Lack of continuous therapeutic drug monitoring is associated with increased health costs, morbidity and mortality. A more dynamic sensing system could improve the therapy and quality of life of patients taking drugs with a narrow therapeutic range. Here, an electrically oscillating system consisting of genetically modified Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) cells is proposed. After transfecting HEK cells with genes encoding key ion channels, an intrinsic rhythm of subsequent de- and repolarization was obtained. Molecular substrates, such as drugs, can open or close these ion channels and thus affect the frequency of the rhythm. This change in frequency can then be measured in vivo by use of a multi-electrode array and correlated to the concentration of the drugs in the blood. Additionally, substrate specificity can be chosen by integration of a certain substrate-sensitive ion channel into the oscillating system. This multipurpose sensor could be developed for medical and biotechnological applications.

https://teams.igem.org/2265	Village	Antibiotic resistance is poised to become one of the greatest dangers of our time. Widespread overuse of antibiotics coupled with minimal investment in new treatments have allowed pathogenic bacteria to develop resistances to many antibiotics. Our team sought to develop a platform that utilizes genetically modified E. coli DH5&#945; to quickly evolve bacteriophages (phages). These phages should be capable of infecting the target bacteria in our coupled chemostat system. We have created a cheap, fast and simple system as well as a mathematical model for understanding its regulation. Photosensors capable of measuring real-time concentration of bacteria and phages were constructed. A plasmid to increase the mutation rate of host bacteria and thus also of invasive phages was designed. Additionally, a protocol for selecting and purifying phages from environmental samples has been developed by our team.
https://teams.igem.org/2266	Environment	In light of the recent discussions regarding the realisation of the UN development goal number 14 concerning the conservation and sustainable use of marine resources, iGEM Lund has set out to aid in the world-wide engagement against microplastic pollution. Microplastic pollution is an ever-growing problem that stems from wasteful lifestyles with propagating adverse effects throughout the entire food chain. Upwards of 10 million metric tons of plastic has been estimated to enter the ocean every year. Participating in the iGEM competition for the first time, team Lund intends to rapidly and accurately determine the presence of microplastics through the design and implementation of a genetic circuit into E. coli. A logic AND-gate will be constructed utilising the conformational change of a heterologously expressed hER-alpha to associate a split fluorescent reporter.
https://teams.igem.org/2267	Manufacturing	Bacterial cellulose is a novel nano-material synthesized by microbiology. BC has a unique three-dimensional net structure with high degree of biological histocompatibility and degradability. Therefore, it has a wide range of application.However,low yield and high cost of producing BC makes it way behind reaching practical need of production and application.Hence, we intended to implement synthetic biology to improve the yield of bacterial cellulose. 1.Refinement of fermentation conditions. It has been proved by research that G.xylinus can reach its highest yield of bacterial cellulose when pH=4.8.Therefore, we intend to control the continually descending pH of the environment during fermentation and maintain its pH to around 4.8. 2.Partial alternation of carbon flux distribution. We hope we can redirect and improve the carbon flux distribution to the pathway of producing bacterial cellulose via over-expressing some key enzymes during the fermetation of G.xylinus.
https://teams.igem.org/2268	Village	In synthetic biology, its essential to implement control mechanisms that disable microbes that are unintentionally released into the enviroment. Teams have developed 'kill-switches', or toxic genes are activated under selected conditions. We decided to create a light-inducible kill-switch, based on the design by Wageningen 2016. This complements our previous project (which we are continuing to explore); enhancing E. coli metabolism for wastewater treatment, in dark conditions. The kill-switch is based upon the pDawn system, activating transcription in the presence of blue light. It features MazF, a mRNA-targeting endonuclease. We have designed controls to verify the expression pattern. Furthermore, we introduced additional layers of regulation to prevent premature cell death. Completion of our previous work, together with our kill-switch, is a step towards an environmentally friendly and safe bacterium for nitrogen removal. Moreover, the creation of an effective light inducible kill-switch is a useful addition to the synthetic biology toolkit.

Ensuring season-less, accessible and local food production promotes a sustainable agriculture. Valencia_UPV provides a whole new system to control plant physiology at both genetic and environmental level. ChatterPlant is a SynBio-based solution that works as plant-human interface allowing a bidirectional communication. First, a root-specific modular optogenetic circuit enables control on plants´ endogenous gene expression (e.g flowering). Then, a sensor circuit with color coded output provides specific information of stress conditions, accelerating corrective measures. The genetic setup is complemented with a hardware device, ChatterBox, specially designed to control plant’s growth conditions. ChatterPlant’s possibilities can be improved gathering Plant SynBio knowledge. PlantLabCo is an open-access online platform which aims to unify Plant SynBio researchers’ work.

https://teams.igem.org/2270	Therapeutics	Our project was inspired on the alarming and increasing number of diabetic people, especially diabetes mellitus type 1 patients, who are insulin dependent. The lack of less invasive treatments has motivated us to develop a new treatment based on the probiotic bacteria Lactococcus lactis, that was engineered to produce a single-chain analog insulin in human diabetics microbiota. The bacteria will be able to produce the insulin associated with a secretion signal sequence and cell-penetrating peptides, to ensure its uptake. Moreover, the synthesis of the insulin will be controlled by the natural bacteria system of catabolite repression with regulation by a sRNA. At the presence of glucose, the insulin gene expression will be activated, and then, it will be ready to be secreted and absorbed, reaching the blood and performing its biological function. The final product could be a fermented milk or a lyophilized that could be easily ingested by patients.
https://teams.igem.org/2271	Foundational Advance	Unknown, unpredictable reactions inside cells pose a major problem in synthetic biological designs as they are affecting the purposed applications. Nature solves the problems of unavoidable interactions or toxification by intermediates and by-products by separating enzymatic reactions through compartmentalization. The integration of pathways into organelles leads to the concentration of enzymes and metabolites, sustains unstable intermediates and enables naturally incompatible reactions to take place simultaneously. We intend to follow natures example and engineer yeasts peroxisomes to create an intracellular space with customized properties. To do so we establish an open source toolbox and enable booting up a compartment perfectly tailored for a specific application. To demonstrate the potential of this approach we relocate the nootkatone and violacein pathway into peroxisomes, modify the compartments characteristics using our toolbox applications and thereby create an artificial compartment with optimal reaction conditions.
https://teams.igem.org/2272	WIKI	Current wastewater treatment methods are complex and often difficult to maintain. During the biological nutrient removal process, sludge composed of co-cultures of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria converts ammonia and nitrites into inert nitrogen gas. Proper treatment of wastewater is important because the release of ammonia and nitrites poses health risks to humans. These toxic chemicals also fuel detrimental water eutrophication. Unfortunately, reaching optimal efficiency of the predominant nitrifier, Nitrosomonas europaea, requires aeration, which is costly for treatment facilities. Here we present a biological device that reduces aeration requirements and eliminates the need for co-cultures. We use a denitrifying bacterium Paracoccus denitrificans as a chassis for a device that contains a nitrification circuit taken from the genome of N. europaea. The addition of amoCAB, haoA, and the associated cytochrome genes creates a complete nitrogen removal system. Upon implementation, our device reduces the operating costs of wastewater treatment plants.
https://teams.igem.org/2273	Foundational Advance	Synthetic biology wants to go beyond the pure biological by integrating concepts from chemistry or physics into the living world. At this interphase, our project wants to introduce Peptidosomes as a new fundamental approach for generating and applying encapsulated bacteria. These spheres possess advantageous properties like stability in different media and a mesh-like structure that allows for the selective exchange of compounds via diffusion. Therefore, we are able to benefit from the entrapped cells’ abilities, while ensuring that they are not released into their surroundings. Using the powerful genetics of <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> and its secretory capabilities we demonstrate communication and cooperation between separately encapsulated bacterial populations as well as the environment. Peptidosomes can be further enhanced by incorporating magnetic or biological beads – which can be functionalized with proteins – into their peptide-based shell. With this unique setup, we provide a whole new universe of applications to the iGEM community.
https://teams.igem.org/2274	Village	Choosing apt and reliable protocols for new experiments is a problem that wet labs routinely face due to the difficulty in anticipating which protocols will produce the best results. Experimental practices may differ immensely across laboratories and precise details of these practices may be lost or forgotten as skilled faculty or students leave the lab to pursue other endeavors. Furthermore, there are few well-defined protocols that are generally agreed upon by the scientific community, in part due to the lack of a system that can supply a measure of a protocols acceptance. In order to address these problems, we set out to build a database that integrates a crowd-sourced ratings and comments system to serve as a protocol curator that enables lab investigators to compare various protocol efficacies, quantify a protocols acceptance within the scientific community, and provide an avenue through which experiential knowledge can be communicated and shared.
https://teams.igem.org/2275	Environment	Aquaculture is expected to become major fishery consumption for human upon the depletion of ocean resources, and to reach USD 202 billions by 2020 in a commercial sight. Keeping water unpolluted is crucial to aquaculture industry, with Nitrate the main target when monitoring water condition. Nevertheless, as to control its concentration, changing water continuously, the most common and affordable way for fish-farmers, is undoubtedly a burden for earth. So how to make monitoring and controlling of Nitrate inexpensive, precisely sensitive and with less manpower? Now, NCKU_Tainan brings a new idea  "NO Problem: A Biological Approach to Nitrate Sensing and Regulation." With a plasmid composed of PyeaR promoter and GFP for nitrate sensing, genes constructed for four enzymes  by which Nitrate transformed into glutamine, a harmless and valuable amino acid  and our own device for both sensing and regulation process, we turn traditional aquaculture into a sustainable industry.

According to NIH reports, around 50-70 million U.S. adults are suffering from sleep insufficiency and poor-quality sleep. The circadian rhythm in human is predominantly under the regulation of melatonin, a hormone produced by pineal gland periodically. This year we want to use engineered E.coli to mimic this process in human. We propose to construct a melatonin biosynthesis pathway in E.coli to produce melatonin, while simultaneously couple this process with periodically-optimized repressilator, a synthetic genetic oscillator with higher precision, with the intention to render melatonin production resemble mammalian periodicity in E.coli.
https://teams.igem.org/2277	Manufacturing	In fermentation industry, numerous valuable products are intracellular metabolites. Thus, the cell disruption step is essential for product extraction. However, traditional cell disruption methods (including sonication and homogenization) usually need additional equipments and are laborious/time-consuming. To improve the efficiency of cell disruption and intracellular products extraction, a lysozyme-encoding gene was successfully integrated into a modified blue-light-controlled gene switch which was evaluated through eGFP gene expression. Subsequently, self-lysis of E. coli cells was assessed under blue light. To control the expression of lysis gene regulated by blue light, a model of light-emitting device was constructed and a layout of fermentor with light-emitting device was designed. Moreover, we made an economic analysis after consulting several bio-factories. It indicated that our design not only reduce the cost in cell disruption but also simplify operation process. Taken together, our project showed an exciting potential for cell disruption and intracellular products extraction in fermentation industry.
https://teams.igem.org/2278	Information Processing	Synthetic biology projects are usually based on a unique strain of microorganism. New exciting possibilities are expected to emerge by using synthetic microbial consortia. This way, the most interesting properties of microorganisms (e.g. detection, production, resistance) can be combined and modified to achieve new desired tasks. This is what we did in our iGEM project. As a proof of concept, we create a synthetic microbial consortium to fight against cholera disease. The players are modified strains of (1) Escherichia coli producing a quorum sensing (QS) molecule to mimic the presence of pathogenic Vibrio cholerae bacteria; (2) Vibrio harveyi producing diacetyl in response to QS molecule; and (3) Pichia pastoris yeast producing antimicrobial crocodile peptides in response to diacetyl. By crossing the border of the cell-to-cell communication between prokaryote-eukaryote, our project brings not only new perspectives to circumvent cholera epidemia but also to design new synthetic biology approaches using microbial consortia.

Quorum sensing (QS) system can play diverse roles in response to bacteria population density, which makes it an intriguing tool for synthetic biologists. Most of the QS systems are relied on the N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) based QS tool kit of Gram-negative bacteria, however, QS tool kit for Gram-positive bacteria has rarely reported. In this project, we want to develope a QS tool kit for Gram-positive bacteria. We will build this tool kit based on the Agr system from S.aureus, the PlcR-PapR system from Bacillus cereus, and the AimR-AimP system from the Bacillus subtilis bacteriophage Phi3T. We are going to test the utility of this tool kit in Bacillus subtilis and Lactococcus lactis. This QS tool kit will facilitate synthetic biologists to construct more sophisticated systems, both in Gram-positive bacteria and mixed microbial consortia.
https://teams.igem.org/2280	WIKI	In the process of oil recovery by water injection, large water channels will be formed. Water mainly flows through these channels, avoiding brushing the oil stuck in the minor channels, so that the oil remains unexplored. Our project is aiming to engineer Enterobacter sp. FY-07 (which is separated from oilfield produced water and able to produce cellulose in anaerobic conditions) using toggle switch, so as to produce rhamnolipid and cellulose in an controllable way. The engineered Enterobacter sp. FY-07 acts as the traffic police controlling the oil flux. In large channels, cellulose is produced to clog the flowing water and help it enter into the minor channels and wash out the oil within them. In minor channels, rhamnolipid is produced to emulsify oil, so the oil can be easily washed out. Our project aims at improving oil recovery rate in the oil harvesting process using the engineered bacteria.
https://teams.igem.org/2281	High School	Mosquitos are capable of transmitting severe diseases to human beings (e.g. malaria, yellow fever&#65292;and microcephaly, etc). Consequently many countries have suffered disasters caused by these epidemics, and there were roughly 1.5 million people killed in 2016. Even worse, most mosquito repellents currently used contain DEET which is detrimental to both humans and environment. Thus, our team, CIEI-BJ, decided to design a biosynthesis pathway to produce a special substance, Citronellol, which is nontoxic to human beings, environmental friendly, and can repel mosquitoes effectively. One of the most significant concern during production is to ensure that neither pollution nor toxin will be released. Therefore, our team transferred geraniol synthase gene (GES) and old yellow enzyme gene (OYE) to E.coli and yeast, then let them help us convert glucose into citronellol. Through this method, we can produce citronellol massively with high efficiency, low cost and zero toxic byproducts.

The appearance of extreme temperature events threatens the agricultural economy and farmers have to deal with the unsatisfactory current solutions. Using synthetic biology, we are developing a thermo-adaptive biological product SofterShock for protecting grapevines against climatic hazards. We are engineering a microorganism to make it respond differently according to the temperatures. Below 15°C, anti-freeze proteins will prevent ice-crystal growth and above 37°C, light-reflecting compounds will limit evapotranspiration. Once applied on crops, our solution will possess a double protection: anti-drought and anti-frost. We elaborate a killswitch strategy to limit microorganism dissemination and DNA transfer. In order to not alter plant biodiversity or wine characteristics, we will select the best chassis to combine with novel properties and bring an innovative approach to global crop protection.

Companies are increasingly turning to physical strategies, involving biometric and digital keys, to secure client accounts. Synthetic biology offers significant unprecedented security opportunities through synthetically generated biometrics. Consequently, we have developed a randomly assorting, fluorescent bacterial key. Separate genes encoding three distinct fluorescent proteins are expressed using different promoters that are capable of inhibition by dCas9. Null and functional sgRNA DNA modules were endowed with identical sticky ends to compete with one another during ligation, generating an ON/OFF fluorescent state and variance for distinguishable keys. Each combination is modelled from lab data, illustrating discernibility. We have designed a safe, portable device for storage of E. coli, paired to a streamlined authentication procedure tailored to be immune to current hacking frameworks. This system is scalable to include any type of protein, synonymously expanding the number of combinations and improving security.

We choose chromoproteins to provide rich colors for indication of multiple signals. Furthermore, by mixing two types of chromoproteins, we can create a third color taken as the characterization of the relative abundance of two signal molecules. We employed small transcription activating RNAs (STAR) to decrease the leaky expression of chromoproteins which we found in our experiment. We also introduced test paper and smartphone into our project to make our system more user friendly. With these designs, even ordinary people can easily tell the concentration of target substances. To test the system, we choose heavy metal ions as an example. Since heavy metal pollution is an urgent problem, we hope our application can be used widely.

Three kind of enzymes,DhaA in Rhodococcus sp, HheC and EchA derived from Agrobacterium radiobacter AD1,are transformed into tobacco to degrade the TCP into non-toxic and harmless glycerin in the soil and sewage,and to achieve the sustained environmental remediation.
https://teams.igem.org/2287	Food & Nutrition	Aquatic products provide Chinese people with gourmet foods as well as high-quality proteins. In China, freshwater aquaculture products contribute up to 68% to total aquaculture products. Nevertheless, in freshwater aquaculture, there exists a major problem of excessive ammonia nitrogen in pond water, which is toxic to aquatic creatures. Although ammonia nitrogen concentration is critical in water quality evaluation, few farming ponds in China are equipped with ammonia monitoring systems, causing fish diseases and reduced aquaculture production. This year, UCAS iGEM team engineered E.coli to sense ammonia in pond water and alert farmers to high ammonia concentration. Furthermore, to remove the excess nitrogen from water, we introduced human xanthine oxidase to transfer ammonia into uric acid precipitation. Consequently, breeding density can be raised and farming water can be recycled, thus reducing costs and increasing benefits. Our uric acid-producing microorganism can also serve as a platform to select effective drugs for gout.
https://teams.igem.org/2288	WIKI	Odor molecule can be sensed via the specific binding with its cognate olfactory receptors and the following elicited signaling cascade within the cell. Our research aims to build a mammalian cell-based biological odor detection system (iSmeller, intensified Smeller) with enhanced sensitivity by employing the CRISPR/Cas9 activation technology. Once an odor binds to the specific olfactory receptors on the cell membrane, it leads to a series of signaling rally and consequently generates a flux of cAMP (cyclic AMP) which could be detected by a cAMP-activated reporter gene system. We implement CRISPR activation apparatus to simultaneously amplify several core components endogenously along the olfactory signal cascade to enhance power and sensitivity of the cellular odor sensor. We will evaluate the performance of iSmeller with two odor/receptor pairs: &#946;-citronellol/OR1A1 and bourgeonal/OR1D2. The iSmeller holds great promise in various applications such as cancer diagnosis, environmental pollution evaluation and food quality control.
https://teams.igem.org/2289	Environment	BiMaTox is a biosensor that detects marine toxins that are produced during harmful algal blooms, also known as red tides. Of these toxins, saxitoxin is the most-deadly, as it attacks the human nervous system impeding synapse formation. The biosensor consists of a cell-free cellulose matrix device that displays a color in the presence of the toxin. This color is produced by the aptazymes which are contained within the device. The aptazyme consist of a specific toxin aptamer connected to a DNAzyme. When the toxin binds to its specific aptamer, the peroxidase activity of DNAzyme is triggered and produces the oxidation of a compound called ABTS, which generates a color that is readily visible to the human eye. The device is constructed in such a way that it is easy and simple to use, with the aim that, for example, fishermen can know when there are toxins in their fishing area.
https://teams.igem.org/2290	Village	Most water sources in developing countries are decentralized. Consequently, drinking water is prone to high levels of fluoride from geological sources, corresponding to endemic fluorosis and may lead to developmental or reproductive defects. Underdeveloped regions in rapidly developing countries, such as China and India, have triple the recommended WHO limit of fluoride in their groundwater. Our project seeks to develop the fluoride riboswitch, an mRNA that can bind to fluoride and regulate the expression of downstream genes, as a technology to combat fluoride contamination in water. We developed a system where the fluoride riboswitch controls the expression of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, allowing bacteria to grow on the antibiotic chloramphenicol in the presence of fluoride. We will use this operon to screen and select riboswitches with higher responsiveness to fluoride. We envision using engineered fluoride riboswitch systems as tools to sequester, bioremediate, or detect fluoride in a cost effective manner.
https://teams.igem.org/2291	Food & Nutrition	With an ever-growing world population, having sustainable and reliable crops for food production is becoming increasingly important. However, every year millions of dollars worth of produce is damaged, lost, or never produced because of frosts. Frost damages new shoots and buds of crop plants through the formation of ice crystals within the tissues, which rupture the surrounding cells. As a result, new plant and fruit growth is severely inhibited. Despite promising research into frost resistance mechanisms, the majority of producers still utilise costly, and often ineffective, traditional methods of frost avoidance. Our team seeks to introduce a variety of frost resistance genes into the model organisms Arabidopsis thaliana and Escherichia coli for characterisation. This will provide insight into the varying ability of frost resistance genes to protect model organisms at sub-zero temperatures, ultimately leading to the production of frost tolerant crops.
https://teams.igem.org/2292	New Application	The WHO estimates that nearly all adults will have dental caries at some point, and the actual dental caries rate in Taiwan is 99.2%. Dental caries are easily ignored by patients since they do not hurt until they become serious. In the worst case, treatment requires tooth implantation, a painful and costly procedure. Carindex, a system designated to evaluate the risk of dental caries through saliva, is here to solve these problems. Three parameters that correlated with dental caries: lactate level, competence stimulating peptide (CSP) concentration, pH value, will be detected in the engineered E. coli, B. subtilis and test paper, respectively. Then, machine learning will use these values to generate a prediction model. Ultimately, Carindex utilizes this model along with the detection devices to alert users to their risk of dental caries, and raise public awareness of dental caries. Expectedly, Carindex can decrease dental caries rate significantly in Taiwan.

Produced predominantly by car emissions, NOx causes significant morbidity and mortality; it exacerbates lung disease and in Bristol alone kills 300 people per year (8.5% of deaths). NOx is also the third most detrimental greenhouse gas. We aim to engineer E. coli to metabolise NOx using the cytochrome c nitrite reductase (NrfA), which reduces nitrite (NO2-) to ammonia, and the Nap periplasmic nitrate reductase to convert nitrate (NO3-) to nitrite. As NOx dissolves to form both nitrite and nitrate, the use of Nap will improve efficiency. The ammonia produced could be used to make fertiliser, or electricity if incorporated into a microbial fuel cell. An agent-based bacterial model will be adapted to predict system efficiency and behaviour. We aim to contain our bacteria within pods to be strategically placed in the most polluted areas, based on our atmospheric pollution modelling.

Most current approaches, however, are based on globally accelerated mutagenesis inevitably leading to unwanted off-target mutations. D.I.V.E.R.T. represents the concept of a new continuous in vivo evolution strategy that allows full spatial control of mutagenesis by building systems that resemble the retrotransposon life cycle: The gene of interests mRNA is reverse transcribed in an error prone way and reintegrated into the genome at the respective locus replacing the original gene for several cycles. To demonstrate the generalizability of the process we plan on carrying out our proof of concept experiment in yeast and E. coli. By the end of August we are still in the cloning stage. Additionally, we are working on a single plasmid system for CRISPR-enhanced chromosomal integration in E. coli.
https://teams.igem.org/2295	Therapeutics	A new approach to cancer treatment is the chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) therapy, which shows promising results fighting tumors in clinical trials. It consists of autologous isolated T cells modified with a chimeric receptor based on the T-cell receptor combined with the recognition domain of an antibody. Upon reinjection, CAR T-cells exhibit cytotoxicity with high affinity towards cells displaying the antigen. However, clinical trials have shown that as tumor antigens are not solely expressed on tumor cells, but also on healthy tissues, grave off-target effects like the Graft-versus-Host-Disease may occur. In order to avoid such side-effects, we engineer CAR T-cell lines specifically activated by factors of the tumor microenvironment. Controlled by a genetic AND-gate system the T cells need two input signals in order to express CAR. This would allow highly localized cytotoxic activity of T cells and provide safer cell-based cancer immunotherapy especially for solid tumors.
https://teams.igem.org/2296	Food & Nutrition	Hydroponics is a rapidly growing area of agriculture that is projected to be a $400 million market by 2020. Despite its potential, hydroponics farmers face low crop yields due to diseases and nutrient imbalances. It is well-documented that a sufficient level of oxidative stress from reactive oxygen species (ROS) is necessary for and can enhance crop growth. To that end, Cornell iGEM developed a novel redox biosensor in E. coli that uses a redox-sensitive fluorescent protein reporter to couple an optogenetic transcriptional circuit to an external optics system. In addition to offering enhanced sensitivity to ROS, this system optimizes oxidative stress by controlling redox-sensitive transcriptional responses with greater precision through an external LED. We believe that this will be promising platform to overcome the drawbacks of hydroponics with potential applications in general agriculture.

AS is characterized by adhesions in the endometrium, and often associated with dilation and curettage of the intrauterine cavity. Current treatment remains ineffective for severe adhesions, which may lead to infertility, repeated miscarriages, obstetric complications, even endometriosis. Our Woundplast aims at treating AS with MSCs in a safe and effective manner. To target and maintain engineered MSCs to the wound, we use Pluronic F-127, an FDA approved material as supporting matrix. Besides, we engineered MSCs to over-express PVDF, bFGF and VEGF individually or in combination to further promote wound healing. We test our idea in vitro with rat model. More importantly, we believe our project has the potential to be used in other types of wound healing, not just AS.

After extracting DNA from the feces and performing the analysis, a nucleic acid sequence will be detected if the patient is infected with cholera. Once these sequences are introduced into the bacteria, fluorescence will be emitted and captured by the camera of a smartphone. The application that we will design will perform the analysis and do the image processing. Plus, the temperature will continuously be monitored within the kit. The greatest advantage of this device will be its capability to communicate the results to its user and to map the cases of cholera. That way, we will be able to know which area is the most affected by the epidemic. Going forward, this kind of device will be replicable for different pathogens, thus allowing to widen the spectrum of this kits use.

By engineering the photosynthesis system into E.coli, green hydrogen fuel can be produced simply from sunlight and water. To do this, we focused on the assembly of the hydrogenase enzyme complex, the final component of the photosynthesis pathway. We successfully added an [FeFe] Hydrogenase enzyme, from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, ferredoxin, ferredoxin NADP+ reductase (FNR) and maturation enzymes (HydEFG), which together, work cohesively to produce our desired green hydrogen gas product. Our modeling and human practice approaches provided an assessment of the viability of the production of hydrogen on an industrial scale.

Though successful switches exist, most require specific molecular signaling mechanisms, limiting their use. We designed a temperature-controlled kill switch activated below 34C using the temperature-dependent repressor TlpA36. Bacteria are lysed by constitutively expressed holin and endolysin unless counteracted by antiholin, which is under the control of TlpA36 and therefore only expressed in a narrow temperature range. This system should function with any gram-negative bacteria. We implemented our switch in E. coli as proof of concept. Promoters of varying strengths were tested to fine-tune the time until lysis, giving researchers a buffer period to work with cells at low temperatures.
https://teams.igem.org/2302	Environment	Civil sewage contains enriched grease with low biodegradability. To develop a novel approach for grease treatment, we designed a microbial cooperation system based on serine-mediated attraction and leucine-mediated repellent of bacteria. Our system consists of 3 Leaders (LA, LB, LC) and 2 Followers (FD, FE) that are engineered microorganisms. LA inducibly secretes serine, LB constitutively secretes leucine, and LC makes acyl-CoA synthetase long chain (ACSL) to metabolize fatty acids. Serine and leucine produced by Leaders can attract or repel FD/FE, respectively. FD secretes lipase to dissolve sewage grease into fatty acids and FE expresses a fatty acid binding protein on its membrane to carry fatty acids. When Followers are attracted to Leaders, a fatty acid-enriched microenvironment can be built to let ACSL from LC metabolize fatty acids. Thus, we developed a novel grease-degrading system consisting of differentially engineered microbial groups, similar to an assembly line in a human society.

https://teams.igem.org/2304	Environment	China is the world's largest producer and consumer of nickel ions. However, nickel and its compounds are one of the primary pollutants in China. They mainly derive from electroplating, nickel metal processing and battery manufacturing. Nickel and its compounds released from the industry have detrimental effects on the environment and hence threaten human health. Therefore, nickel is one of the heavy metals that are often monitored in the environment and food chains. The traditional nickel detecting method is to implement chemical measurement of nickel-containing samples in the laboratory, which is time-consuming, expensive, and difficult to operate. Thus, we expect to create a cheap, user-friendly E. coli biosensor, a type of bacterium that produces fluorescence protein when it detects nickel ions in the environment. Consequently, we can find out the amount of nickel ions existing in a certain environment by examining the intensity of fluorescence produced by the probing bacteria.
https://teams.igem.org/2305	Diagnostics	To facilitate early diagnosis, we contrived a biosensor of onset-pathological biomarkers with high sensitivity, affordability, and analyte modifiability. Detection of Alpha Fetal Protein (AFP, a well-studied cancer indicator) is an exemplar demonstration of this device. Here is how it works: first, lysine is attached to DNA segment that is complementary to AFP-bonding aptamers. When AFP is bonded with aptamer, complementary chain is released; then, trypsin detaches lysine, which then enters fluorescents-producing, lysine-deficient E. coli system. Results are recorded, analyzed, visualized by independently designed device. Here are three highlights: first, biosensor (aptamer) is able to be artificially designed aimed at target biomarker; second, bioamplifier (gene knock-out, strong promoter, cycle amplifier and dual-fluorescence) realizes improvement of signal to noise ratio; third, micro-fluidic chip and fluorescence detector make it possible that the assay can work in practical. Therefore, the performance of system indicates it could be a promising assay in in-vitro diagnosis.
https://teams.igem.org/2306	New Application	The existing methods to detect the presence of a specific RNA sequence in a sample are laborious and require both trained personnel and sophisticated lab equipment. Inevitably, these restrictions limit the development of diagnostic detection methods based on specific RNA sequences. Here, we aimed to overcome these limitations by using the CRISPR-Cas protein Cas13a. Once this recently characterized protein binds to its complementary target, it unspecifically cleaves all surrounding RNA. Utilizing this property we designed a system for the detection of antibiotic resistance genes in agricultural pathogens, aiming to combat the global rise of antibiotic resistance. We developed a procedure to extract biological samples and detect RNA sequences of interest by converting the collateral cleavage activity of Cas13a to a read-out visible to the naked eye. Through ongoing interaction with direct stakeholders, we made substantial progress towards making not only durable components but a cheap, safe and reliable detection method.

We can obtain logical gates involving proteins from STAR family and the White Collar Complex which is a photoinducible system. At the same time, a bioinformatic part has been developed in connection with scientific project. This part is intended to create a workflow to streamline the study of the alternative splicing after the use of RNAseq technology. C.elegans is currently a great model used to study many diseases through foundational research.

https://teams.igem.org/2308	Energy	Traditional energy will finally come to exhaustion, and the development of new energy is extremely urgent. To produce hydrogen, which is a clean and efficient source of energy, through microbial photosynthesis is an environmentally friendly and sustainable pathway. However, the facts such as low efficiency of bio-hydrogen production, lack of large-scale application device and others hinder the application prospect of bio-hydrogen production. Therefore, this project aims to expand the absorption spectrum of photosynthetic bacteria by the way of forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) in order to improve the efficiency of the photoreaction. On top of that, we will also design a photo-reactor special for bio-hydrogen production to solve the problem of applying it on a large scale.
https://teams.igem.org/2309	Therapeutics	Staphylococcus aureus develops resistance to various antibiotics and becomes increasingly difficult to be eliminated due to antibiotic overuse. Patients with intestinal S. aureus colonization tend to suffer from fecal incontinence, diarrhea and so on. Hence, our project aims to make the most of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), which have a reputation for their efficient antimicrobial activity against bacteria, as new therapeutics. We genetically engineer Lactococcus lactis (Grenadier Guards) to closely detect the presence of S. aureus and throw AMPs (grenades) to eradicate them within a short time after infection. The mechanism includes utilizing the S. aureus’s own quorum sensing system as a sensor, or using the cells’ osmoregulatory system to control the expression of the AMP genes in tandem repeats, which can produce a relatively high quantity level, subsequently Lactococcus lactis will undergo autolysis controlled by a toggle switch to release AMPs to attack S. aureus, thus relieving the symptoms.
https://teams.igem.org/2310	Environment	With the increasing amount of industrial wasted water being discharged into water areas, various kinds of harmful ions have had a great impact on the ecological environment and daily drinking water, but the degree of detection of these ions is limited in some special institutions and instruments, which cannot be portable, real-time and general. Thus, we plan to develop a miniature instrument to achieve these goals. To achieve a trace detection, we designed a genetic system which can amplify electrochemical signals or optical signals. At the same time, we designed a device based on micro-fluid chip to concentrate our engineered bacteria on improving the sensitivity of detection following the principles of modularity, cheapness and easy operation. Last but not least, our system provides an innovative and satisfying platform of detection for other molecules by simply changing corresponding promoters.

But this loop will be open because of its background expression. The AiiA, which can hydrolyze the AHL, will be control the background expression, together with the Lac operon being the system main switch. Furthermore, the input defined by user will have a negative correlation to the opening time. Hence, there need a model to describe this relation and even realize quantitative determination.

The periodically outbreak of Enteromorpha on the coastline has been a stubborn environmental problem in ShanDong, China. Here, we aim to utilize the cellobiose and xylose from waste algae and turn them into ethanol as healthy and tasty algae wine with resveratrol. Additionally, we achieved a new synthetic biology platform for artificial interspecific cooperation. E.coli and S. cerevisiae are engineered to organize together as multi-cell device. The co-cultured E. coli works as surface-display system of S. cerevisiae for enhancing its biological function. Simultaneously, we built a mini transcriptional unit of standardized promoters and terminators with concise structure in Yeast, providing more potential for large-scale SynBio operations. Our project can contribute to local environmental issue and enrich synthetic biology toolbox by novel interspecific cooperation platform and transcription regulatory elements.
https://teams.igem.org/2315	Foundational Advance	In synthetic biology, building complex logic circuits are often difficult, especially in a single cell population. It requires many non-crosstalking information processing units such as quorum sensing (QS) factors, to work within a cell without significant interference. However, these non-crosstalking QS factors are very limited. Furthermore, even for simple circuits, one has to create de novo which can be difficult for beginners. It would be ideal to use modularized parts assemble directly into circuits. Therefore, we aimed to create a multilayer signal-processing system by using compartmentalized QS factors. We have provided proof-of-concept data and modeling to show that our system would allow faithful information flow between bacterial population. Also, we aimed to build QS part libraries to allow easily switching of parts, changing signal inputs and outputs without de novo cloning. Thus, our system may not only increase signal-processing power, but also make it more friendly to synthetic biologists.

Originally functioning as bacterial adaptive immune systems, CRISPR-Cas-based technologies have been extensively studied and improved upon in recent years. Our team is interested in overcoming current limitations of CRISPR-Cas technologies, which may hinder their efficiency and deployment in living cells and organisms. There are three projects that we are working on. First, we are interested in enhancing the efficiency of HDR repair, which is utilized by scientists to precisely edit certain genes of their interest, by fusing the Cas9 enzyme with a HDR protein. Second, we are trying to deploy the enhanced design to correct a non-small-cell lung cancer mutation. Third, we are optimizing the dCas9 DNA-targeting scaffold by exploring potential deletions and introducing several mutations that will render it to be more compact and better than the traditional dCas9.
https://teams.igem.org/2317	Environment	2017Jilin_China takes biosafety into our major concern. Our research interst has been attracted to Chlorophenol, one important raw material in organic synthesis. Though widely used in industrial and agricultural production, the water pollution resulted from the leakage or non-compliance of the emissions becomes a huge threaten to human health. Therefore, we designed a self-regulated circuit with the protein DmpR as the sensor to identify chlorophenol signals and its derivation, and to initiate expression of the two critical enzymes-- monooxygenase and dioxygenase in two E.coli strains for degradation of chlorophenol in water. Additionally, we added a toxin-antitoxin (TA) system for the self-regulation of E.coli growth. In the absence of pollutants, the engineered bacteria will express toxin that can inhibit their own growth. When exposed to contaminants, the expressing of antitoxin will be initiated and block the toxicity, bringing bacteria back to normal, so that the purification mission will be completed.
https://teams.igem.org/2318	Software	With regard to construction of synthetic biological systems, it is observed in several iGEM projects and literature that E. coli could not express quite a number of interesting phenotypes that are native to specific organisms. In such cases it is advantageous to use those organisms and introduce synthetic circuits into them. Hence, it is desirable to have a catalogue of alternative host organisms with specific characters, and a database of protocols, parts and software tools to work with them. Our database will consist of a collection of organisms used as hosts, their physical attributes, protocols involved in culturing and transformation, and host-wise listing of biobrick parts and other vectors. It shall serve as a platform for synthetic biologists to exchange all relevant information about host organisms. Along with the database, a set of necessary computational tools such as codon optimisation will also be developed.
https://teams.igem.org/2319	New Application	Gas vesicles (GVs) are hollow protein nanostructures synthesized by phototrophic haloarchaea and cyanobacteria to regulate their flotation in aquatic habitats. Bioengineered GVs have been genetically modified for diverse purposes including ultrasonic molecular imaging, gauging cellular turgor pressures, and vaccine delivery  harnessing unique acoustic, mechanical, and surface properties of GVs  but none of their current applications exploits their most fundamental characteristic: buoyancy. Our modelling indicates that clusters of GVs float several orders of magnitude better than individual GVs, as buoyancy scales with volume while Stokes drag scales with effective radius. Our project iFLOAT aims to improve the flotation of gas vesicles by clustering them using three distinct methods  charge-based flocculation, biotin-streptavidin interaction, and SpyCatcher-SpyTag heterodimerization  and simultaneously develop robust, reproducible flotation assays. Potential future applications of buoyant clusters of bioengineered gas vesicles include bioremediation of oil spills and flotation-based separation and purification of specific targets from mixtures.

According to WHO database, more than 80% of the people around the world are exposed to pollutants. These are measured by instruments like GC-FID, PTRMS which are costly and cumbersome to install. Therefore, alternative and cost effective approaches are required. So, we would like to develop a detector and capture system for pollutants by designing synthetic circuit in E. coli. For detecting and reducing/capturing salicylate, we designed a synthetic circuit and simulated it for its feasibility based upon kinetic equations. From simulation results, bacteria is showing color gradation from yellow to green on the basis of levels of salicylate present in the environment. We cloned a part of circuit for producing yellow color in bacteria. The cloning of other part for producing gradation of color and developing it as a paper based system is going on.
https://teams.igem.org/2321	Therapeutics	Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer-related death among the world with low overall survival rate. In NSCLC, immunotherapy has been indicated as a potential therapy for treating in situ solid tumor. Previous research has indicated that tumor cells can express programmed death-1 ligand (PD-L1) to diminish T-cell effector functions and therefore to achieve immune escape. In our project, gene edition will be incorporated with immunotherapy to eradicate the immune escape occurred in NSCLC. By constructing plasmid with Crispr-Cas 9 system targeting the gene coding for PD-L1, the expression of PD-L1 will be inhibited to restore immune system supervision. To ensure the biosafety, another plasmid with Crsipr-Cas 9 system to cut off the housekeeping gene of two plasmids will be also constructed to suicide both plasmids when PD-L1 expression was not detectable. Better therapeutic effects of immunotherapy to conquer the NSCLC are hoped to be achieved.

Considering the high salt concentration in food waste, which greatly influences the efficiency when we use microbes to decompose the waste, our team aims to transfer salt resistant genes into the functional microbes. In this research, we decided to modify the yeast, specifically saccharomycetes cerevisiae, by inserting the E.coli glutamate synthase (gltB) gene and trehalose synthesis related genes (ScTPS1 and SpTPS1) into it, to make the yeast not only decompose the food waste efficiently but resist high salinity. These genes help produce small molecular substances (glutamate and trehalose), which enable the cells to automatically adjust the osmotic pressure in high salinity environments. In this way, we can better take care of the troublesome food waste in a more cost-effective and environmentally friendly way.

Recently, the RNA-targeting protein CRISPR-Cas13a has been used for highly sensitive DNA and RNA detection, promising diverse applications in point-of-care diagnostics. We integrated Cas13a in the detection unit of CascAID, our GMO-free diagnostic platform. CascAID combines an automated microfluidic device for rapid lysis and extraction of nucleic acids with a paper-based readout system. We demonstrated the performance of our device by targeting the 16S RNA from E. coli. We improved the detection limit of our platform, using simulations to optimize our amplification scheme and the final readout. Conceived as a distributable platform for rapid point-of-care diagnostics, CascAID can be used to distinguish between bacterial and viral infections, thus minimizing the widespread use of antibiotics. Furthermore, Cas13a allows the fast design of target sequences, making our system adaptive to the emergence of new viral outbreaks or fast mutating pathogens.

Pili are hair-like structures found on bacteria that attach to cell surface mannose molecules, using their terminal pili protein, FimH. Our aim is to fuse a variety of metal binding proteins to the FimH protein by modification of the fimH gene. The modified bacteria will be contained in a fluidised media reactor filter system used in conjunction with a hydrocyclone to prevent GMO release. Our modular cloning strategy, allows us to develop a toolkit for a wide number of pili applications and further future developments.
https://teams.igem.org/2325	New Application	Microbial fermentation is an important component of industrial biotechnology and is increasingly popular, with products ranging from bulk chemicals to bioactive molecules. However, despite advance in biotechnology and improvement in fermentation control, microbial contamination and phages infection during fermentation process still remain major concerns worldwide. This is due to the widespread distribution of microorganism as well as phages and the consequent negative economic impact caused by frequent sterilization. In an effort to avoid fermentation failure and even to make these processes more economical, we try to introduce a robust strain for developing the fermentation process in the open (unsterile) culture. Here, we introduce the metabolic pathways of formamide and phosphite into the host to fit our special designed medium so that the unexpected microorganism could not exist. Additionally, applying CRISPR/Cas9 system makes the host attain phage resistance ability. Eventually, an open fermentative process can be achieved.

Our project aims to develop GABA-enriched probiotics including species such as Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. Bulgaricus ATCC11482 and Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 through synthetic biology methods that may simplify the process of GABA production. In the bacterial way of GABA synthesis, two proteins, the glutamate: GABA antiporter (gadC) and the glutamate decarboxylase (gadA), form the glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) system. Though many bacteria incorporate these two genes, we select these genes from Lactobacillus brevis NCL912, a Lactic Acid Bacteria that is able to produce high amount of GABA with unique GAD sequences. In addition, we try to optimize the production of GABA in the two probiotics by adjusting the transcriptional rate between gadA and gadC.
https://teams.igem.org/2327	Foundational Advance	Despite the fundamental role transcription factors play, they place many constraints on experimental designs due to limited types available. Synthetic guide RNA can be modulated to match existing promoters, allowing for targeted regulation without the need for DNA manipulation. Inspired by Gander’s study, “Digital logic circuits in yeast with CRISPR-dCas9 NOR gates”, we have decided to build a NOR gate, whose output is controlled via inducible production of gRNA-complexed dCas9. First, we will create four different strains of yeast, each representing a stationary state. The system has two different gRNA; the expression of either results in the inhibition or transcription of yeGFP. Finally, we will create another strain containing a NOR gate, whose different output states can be modified by controlling the production of both gRNAs using different inducible promoters. Thus, our project verifies regulated recruitment using synthetic guide RNA as a viable alternative to conventional transcriptional regulatory modules.

Several important enteropathogens and probiotics are on our list, including facultative anaerobe and obligate anaerobe, like EHEC O157:H7, Bifidobacterium longum and so on. We construct different shuttle vectors to express this fluorescent system and successfully prove that it works well. Through the expression system, bacteria with fluorescence can be detected in a living body, making in vivo imaging come true.
https://teams.igem.org/2329	Diagnostics	Lung cancer is the cancer form with the highest death toll. Late occurring symptoms and limited expensive detection methods leads to late detection of the disease, which is the most important reason to the high death toll. Specific Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC)s are molecules that have been found in the breath of lung cancer patients. In our project we are creating a biosensor for two of these VOCs. Receptors natively present in the membrane of yeast are replaced with xenogeneic receptors that are able to recognize the VOCs. When the VOCs are sensed the pheromone pathway is initiated and a detection system triggered, ultimately leading to that the yeast cells turns red through interruption of the ADE2 gene. The goal of this project is to create a simple, cheap and harmless method enabling detection of lung cancer in an early stage, leading to more lives being saved.
https://teams.igem.org/2330	Therapeutics	The threat posed by antibiotic resistant bacteria is a pressing issue which must be addressed. It is difficult and expensive to develop new antibiotics, so our project is designed to make currently available antibiotics useful again. Our aim is to create a toolkit to re-sensitise pathogens to antibiotics using CRISPR and a two-phage system, based on work by Yosef et al. (2015). An engineered lysogenic phage will transfer a CRISPR system to its host bacterium, designed to cleave resistance genes and also confer protection from an engineered lytic phage. When this lytic phage is added to the population, it kills any bacteria that have not been successfully re-sensitised. We chose to target genes found in the highly-resistant ESKAPE pathogens, and worked with 4 different phages - P1, lambda, T4 and T7. Our system was modelled in silico and tested empirically on a specially designed E. coli testing platform.
https://teams.igem.org/2331	WIKI	Lignocellulose, a component of a plant cell wall, is a largely untapped source for low-cost cellulosic biofuel production. First, lignocellulose must be broken down into component sugars by cellulases, hemicellulases, and various debranching enzymes. Because the primary diet of porcupines is lignified plant material, we reasoned that the porcupine microbiome would be filled with enzymes required to degrade lignocellulose. Using in silico metagenomic analysis, we mined the porcupine microbiome to identify, synthesize and characterize microbial enzymes required for cellulose and hemi-cellulose degradation. Using an orthogonal approach, we created a metagenomic library in E. coli from the porcupine microbiome, to be screened for the ability to grow on lignocellulose, or other pathway intermediates, as a sole carbon source. This work provides a solid foundation for future development of a bioreactor utilizing enzymes from the porcupine microbiome to convert lignocellulose into biofuel.

In contrast to current mechanical and chemical methods for gene control, our light-based strategies allow for the precise spatiotemporal and non-invasive control of complex gene circuits. To minimize the usage of electricity for illumination and fossil fuels for building materials, we are testing the feasibility of optogenetics to provide an eco-friendly and sustainable alternative. We are engineering bacterial cells that i) control their bioluminescence in response to day/night cycles and ii) can be directed by light to form physical structures out of biodegradable plastic. Additionally, to address the scalability and speed issues in tissue engineering, we are developing an optical guidance system for inter-cell adhesion and directed gene expression of mammalian cells for tissue generation. This will enable fast in situ cell adhesion for tissue-specific organ healing.
https://teams.igem.org/2333	Village	It has become apparent that a fundamental principle of cellular signal processing is the encoding of information within the temporal dynamics of regulatory circuits. For synthetic circuits to achieve the versatility and effectiveness of endogenous circuits, it is necessary to develop simple, effective methods to control a circuit’s speed. Current approaches to speed control are too complex for widespread use— we lack a modular system that allows one to “swap out” a sequence to predictably change a gene’s speed just as swapping an RBS can change the gene’s expression strength. To address this need, we developed a BioBrick suite of degradation tags associated with an E. coli-orthogonal protease, providing the parts and characterization necessary for controlling genetic circuit speed in a simple, modular, and predictable way. Additionally, we created a searchable database of previous iGEM teams’ outreach projects, designed to better enable future teams to build upon previous outreach efforts.

In addition, we built a dialysis-like device combined with modified bacteria to utilize the urate directly in the blood.

About 20% of the population currently suffer from this type of seasonal hay fever in Japan. The general symptoms are, sneezing, runny nose, nasal congestion and itchy eyes. There is an opinion that the balancing of helper T cells which controls the immune system is involved. Helper T cells transmit&#65363; antigen information to B cells, which are antibody-producing cells. And depending on the type of cytokine produced, it is roughly divided into type 1(Th1) and type 2(Th 2).

Here we have proposed REEBOT, the REE robot, which could sense lanthanide ions by its membrane protein, and then catch those ions with the artificial peptides on its surface. After its enriching process, REEBOT would be adsorbed to silicon with the help of Si-tag, enabling us to recycle it. To enhance its efficiency and specificity, we have also designed an awakening system: only under the presence of rare earth elements could REEBOT start its enriching and recycling system, which could also ensure its safety.

However, it is difficult for people in poor areas to continuously obtain protein rich foods. Therefore, in addition to these ingredients, we propose "air" anyone can easily take it into the body. We got the idea from Papuans living in Papua New Guinea. Despite their low-protein diets, they have muscular bodies. It is thought that nitrogen fixing bacteria in their intestines are influencing on protein nutrition. We thought to construct a pathway to synthesize amino acids from nitrogen in E.coli, introduce it into the intestine in the future. To synthesize amino acids, we first express nitrogenase to convert nitrogen to ammonia. We then express amino acid dehydrogenases to synthesize glutamate and phenylalanine from accumulated ammonia. This makes it possible to make people available to protein sources by breathing the air. This will contribute to the solution of protein shortage.

Antimicrobial peptides have found a meteoric acclamation amongst research scientists owing to their lineament of resisting the resilience of bacteria. Latarcins are antimicrobial peptides found in spider venom. Latarcin-2a(M-Zodatoxin) is a 26 amino acid, highly cationic peptide that lyses microbes via a discrete, membrane-specific carpet mechanism. A proposed mutation to its native form eliminates its existing haemolytic and cytolytic activity thus rendering it innocuous to humans. In an attempt to overcome the lethal effects of Latarcin on our chassis itself, a quorum sensing mechanism will be incorporated into our host. Having identified a niche in the food preservative sector, we plan to enclose this engineered strain in a food wrapper to extend the shelf life of food.

https://teams.igem.org/2340	New Application	Cas13a is a RNA guided endonuclease which degrades RNAs based on alignment of its CRISPR derived guide RNA. To determine the sub-cellular localization of messenger RNA (mRNA) we fluorescently tagged a Cas13a that cannot cleave its target RNA (dCas13a). This was achieved by using four mutations, two in HEPN1 and two in the HEPN2 domains, which although ablating nuclease activity, still permitted dCAS13a to bind the target RNA sequence. In tandem we designed guide RNAs for targeting mRNA of four cytosolic proteins. Visualization of the dCAS13a was achieved by fusion with a GFP, and to enhance target detection, a nuclear localization sequence sequestered the dCas13a-GFP in the nucleus until needed in the cytosol, thus reducing background noise. We have performed verification tests, constructed mathematical models and developed multiple tools for public engagement. Our findings will lead to the development of a new tool for research and potentially in diagnostic laboratories.

Our aim is to design a biobadge detecting excessive UV exposure and therefore warn us to seek sun protection should it become necessary. This badge would work as a capsule holding E. coli cells, changing colours as the UV intensity increases. Therefore, we investigated two approaches using photocaged tyrosine (o-nitrobenzyl tyrosine). In both cases, UV-rays will release the tyrosine and enhance a reporter signal. (1) Starting with a tyrosine auxotroph E. coli strain, a reporter RFP will be synthetized once tyrosine is liberated from its cage. (2) Using a photocaged peptide and a specific transcription factor called ComR, we also aim at UV-controlling the expression of the reporter gene. The capsule would also work as a safe and reliable containment, destroying the engineered microorganisms once the biobadge is discarded.

Currently, antibiotics are among the most common acne treatments. However, 50% of bacteria associated with acne are already resistant to the antibiotics used. Our project aims to develop a novel treatment for acne using an antimicrobial peptide, dermcidin, naturally found in human sweat. Dermcidin has shown to be active against Propionibacterium acnes, the bacterium associated with acne. Patients with acne also have reduced expression of dermcidin, which suggests that it might contribute to the condition. We aim to produce dermcidin tied to a cellulose-binding domain, which would enable the immobilization of the peptide on a cellulose surface. This would allow the usage of dermcidin in various skin care products, such as hydrogel masks and exfoliation pads.

We make use of bacterial oscillator related to quorum sensing molecules. In particular the idea is to create three E. coli strains, expressing three fluorescent proteins under an oscillating gene regulation circuit controlled by three molecular inducers. The patterns of the emitted fluorescence by the co-culture will be used as input signal for a colour-to-sound translation software. The end will be a son et lumière" show which will serve as demonstration of the complexity and beauty of the fascinating biomolecular world. We want to demonstrate that such hidden beauty can be disclosed only by the use of biotechnological tools.
https://teams.igem.org/2344	Food & Nutrition	To ensure consumer safety, all processed food and beverages are subject to rigorous testing for contaminants that are hazardous to human health. This testing can be expensive, inaccessible and time-consuming. Since these sophisticated tests are often limited to large-scale producers, local dairy farmers, microbreweries and home-brewers remain vulnerable to penalties and poisoning should the level of contaminants in their products fall outside the regulatory guidelines. Our iGEM project aims to create a biosensor, specifically to detect antibiotic residues in milk and methanol in alcohol. The universal readout will incorporate a blue chromoprotein, AmilCP, which will correlate with the concentration of the contaminant and be quantified with a portable colourimetric device linked to smartphones. A cell-free system will be utilised to circumvent the risks associated with the use of genetically-modified live bacteria outside the laboratory.

https://teams.igem.org/2346	Village	Pickles have long been an important part in the worldwide diet. But the nitrite generated in the production of pickles has always been a concerning problem to health and food safety, due to its conversion to carcinogenic nitrosamine once taken up by humans. Currently, most industrial production of pickles relies on the natural decomposing process of nitrite, which is inefficient and often takes months to complete. To make an improvement, we designed a bio-device to make the degradation of nitrite more rapid and environmental-friendly. Our device consists of a positive feedback loop device followed by a fusion enzyme which can reduce nitrite to nitrogen and oxygen. The feedback loop is regulated by a nitrite/nitrate specific promoter to ensure the expression of downstream function proteins only in pickles environment. Our solution drastically shorten the production period and increases profit margin for the multibillion-dollar pickled vegetables industry.
https://teams.igem.org/2347	Manufacturing	Acrylic acid is a bulk chemical raw material,whose excellent polymerization capacity is widely used in many fields.This year, we chose to use glycerol as carbon source to achieve the all green production of acrylic acid. Based on the core enzyme Ceas2, high-yield acrylic acid cell factory was built through the Part,Pathway,System and Process. We designed the Ceas2 mutant by utilizing the AEMD platform. HPLC and HTS techniques were applied in screening for Ceas2 mutants of high catalytic efficiency.We devised GDC pathway, achieving complete synthesis from glycerol to acrylic acid. In addition, we add a reduction power module for this pathway.We constructed a new pathway in E. coli and S. cerevisiae respectively,and after prediction via metabolic flux modeling,we optimized the cell metabolism by using the RED and CRISPR-Cas9 technique. The cell production process was hereby bolstered by optimizing the fermentation process and screening the carbon source,Buffer,temperature,pH and other experimental conditions.
https://teams.igem.org/2348	Information Processing	The aim of project ColiBot is to create a robot-bacteria interface in which information processing is done by a bacterial culture that forms a feedback loop with a mobile robot. Escherichia coli is cultivated in a bioreactor, which provides stable conditions. Communication from bacterial cells to robot, the output signal, is achieved by fluorescence proteins. The expression of those proteins is influenced by certain environmental conditions. For measurement, a small culture sample will be transported through a modular system to a measurement chamber that detects the fluorescence wavelengths of the culture. This procedure is repeated over and over again, while the robot moves accordingly through an arena. Our first approach of this project is based on thermosensitive bacteria for information processing. Until now, this project already shows satisfactory results. Now, we are primary focusing on the second part of our project, trying to achieve information processing by pH shift.
https://teams.igem.org/2349	Manufacturing	Ethylene is the building block of many chemical compounds. Its polymer, polyethylene, is the main component in numerous plastic materials. Due to its versatility, the demand for ethylene has been increasing during the last decade. As it is derived from petroleum, which is a non-renewable source, it is necessary to find an environmentally friendly way of producing ethylene to satisfy this demand. In this project, two yeast strains with completely different roles will be genetically modified to produce ethylene from sucrose. The focus of the project is set to make those strains dependent on each-other and to provide a balanced growth. This approach represents a more efficient method than cloning the whole pathway into one population, especially when longer heterologous pathways will be used in the future to produce more complex chemicals. Energy gain due to lower metabolic burden and balanced co-factor metabolism will result in higher production rates.
https://teams.igem.org/2350	Energy	Facing the threatening energy crisis, scientists are craving for alternative energy sources. Taking both clean energy productivity and other factors under consideration, we have decided to target our project on increasing the oil accumulation in microalgae by multiple approaches. On the one hand, we have determined to make microalgae undergo nitrogen starvation to increase its oil accumulation by creating a co-culturing system of microalgae and NrtA-transformed Escherichia coli that can deprive microalgae of nitrogen source. On the other hand, we have changed the color of microalgae by transforming pigmentation functions from other species into microalgae cells to enhance its efficiency of photosynthesis. By combining these two approaches, we can develop a new intelligent system which can enhance bio-energy production and contribute to the needs of renewable clean energy.
https://teams.igem.org/2351	WIKI	We aim to create a DNA detection kit for diagnosis of diseases caused by microorganisms, such as Chagas disease. Current test-kits for Chagas disease lack in specificity or sensitivity and require trained personnel and a well-equipped laboratory, which are often not available in rural areas. Our system, called OUTCASST, detects pathogen DNA, allowing for direct diagnosis in a simple, robust and inexpensive manner that can be used in absence of laboratory equipment. It works through DNA binding and colocalization of catalytically inactive Cas9 and Cpf1 fused to membrane proteins and exposed to the extracellular medium. To assemble OUTCASST, we generated inactive Cas9 and Cpf1 variants and checked for functionality. In parallel, several modelling techniques were employed to identify venues for optimization. OUTCASST can be adapted easily to detect any desired DNA sequence and is therefore a valuable addition to the pool of toolkits for disease diagnosis.
https://teams.igem.org/2352	Environment	Amphibian populations worldwide are threatened by the disease Chytridiomycosis, which is caused by the aquatic fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). Chytridiomycosis often leads to death; however, a few species of amphibians are resistant to the Chytridiomycosis infection. The resistance is conferred by symbiotic bacteria present on their skin that produce antifungal metabolites. The UFlorida iGEM team seeks to develop a new treatment for Chytridiomycosis based on these antifungal metabolites. One such antifungal compound, tryptophol, has been shown to be effective at combating Bd at low doses. Tryptophan is converted to tryptophol by three enzymes, Aromatic Amino Acid Aminotransferase II, 2-oxo Acid Decarboxylase, and Alcohol Dehydrogenase I. Our team modified E.coli with the genes comprising the pathway for tryptophol synthesis. The UFlorida team expects to demonstrate that the tryptophol from the genetically modified E. coli will show antifungal activity against the Chytridiomycota family as an antifungal treatment for amphibians.
https://teams.igem.org/2353	High School	In the development of genetic circuits, researchers often face issues with the overlap of protein expression. As a result, the 2017 Lambert iGEM team aimed to develop a clean way to switch off protein expression by further characterizing a proteolytic mechanism known as ClpXP. An inducible genetic construct was made to express tsPurple (a chromoprotein) and degrade via ClpXP upon induction of varying levels of IPTG, resulting in correlating amounts of protein degradation. Data was collected on the teams engineered Chrom-Q, a 3-D printed camera-device that supports a constant light source for centrifuged cells; in turn the data was analyzed using Lambert iGEM's self-constructed software app to determine HSL values. The purpose and goal for this technology was to promote scientific research under any financial circumstance to quantify data in standardized conditions. Measuring relative strengths of protein degradation using self-engineered products will allow an economic approach in characterizing non-lysosomal proteolysis.
https://teams.igem.org/2354	Environment	This year, our goal is to build a system that can detect and degrade EDCs. In many developing countries, factories spew toxic water into rivers, and farmers nearby may accidentally utilize it. EDCs can interfere with endocrine systems, causing harmful effect on organisms. In our project, we focus on two common kinds of EDCs, BPA and NP. For detection, we modified E.coli to express EDC receptor, ER&#945; and GFP. Next, we assembled monobodies on gold surface. We can measure the fluorescent intensity of GFP or information of SPR via interaction between ER&#945; and monobody, thus estimate the concentration of EDCs. For degradation, we modified E.coli to produce target enzymes which can degrade BPA and NP. We integrated target enzymes with activated carbon and bioreactor system to eliminate EDCs. In conclusion, our project aims to solve water safety issue for farmers in developing countries and create a more healthy agricultural environment.
https://teams.igem.org/2355	WIKI	Envenomation by snakebite is one of the most neglected diseases with an estimated 5 million cases each year. These result in an estimated 100,000 deaths and 400,000 disabilities annually. The only effective treatment is animal derived antivenoms, which frequently causes adverse reactions. As a result, they are often only administered as a last resort. We aim to develop a detection-assay that enables us to determine what type of snake a victim is envenomed by. The strategy is to target distinguishable enzymatic features in the different snake venoms by developing suitable substrate-based diagnostics. Our diagnostic tool can be useful in identifying the relative composition of specific venom components in a blood sample and thereby allow for the safest course of treatment.
https://teams.igem.org/2356	New Application	Cancer is a major cause of death worldwide. With our project, GUPPI, we hope to set the basics of a system that can encapsulate the cancerous tissue to prevent metastasis in an early stage. GUPPI utilizes Protein Protein Interactions and is inspired by the formation of membraneless organelles by multivalent interactions. A designed protein scaffold and its binding partner, both having sequential repeating units, will respond to an inducer and form a gel-like structure. We envision that later on, GUPPI can respond to extracellular conditions that will act as an inducer of the gelation to specifically target and encapsulate the desired tissue. The GUPPI system has some major advantages, such as the tunability of the proteins multivalency and the possible adaptation of interactions. Furthermore, a rule-base-model is developed to predict, verify and characterize the wet-lab experiments and act as an additional support.
https://teams.igem.org/2357	WIKI	Homoserine lactones (HSLs) are a family of small molecules used to coordinate behavior in some bacteria. Group regulation is known as quorum sensing (QS) and is responsible for behaviors such as bacterial virulence, growth, and bioluminescence. Genetic components from QS systems have been modularized by synthetic biologists and incorporated into synthetic circuits. A significant hurdle to using HSLs in synthetic systems is cross-reactivity between a sender and non-target receivers. Crosstalk can be mitigated by orthogonal systems that do not communicate with each other. Our project characterizes interactions between HSL-producing sender cells and our newly developed receivers (LasR, TraR, and RpaR) using an HSL-induced GFP reporter system. We expect to add 3 new well-characterized receivers to build upon foundational advances such as the work with LuxR (BBa_F2620) by B. Canton. Our work also builds upon important research in biosafety (from our 2016 project) by using ethyl alcohol eliminate HSL bioactivity.
https://teams.igem.org/2358	High School	Cancer mortality rate is very high. The biggest characteristic of cancer cells is rapid cell division, resulting in the hypoxia microenvironment of solid tumor. Our project is to construct three plasmids, which are transported to the solid tumor using the probiotics Nissle 1917 as gene delivery carrier. When the extracellular environment lacks of oxygen, a plasmid in Nissle 1917 can express invasin and Hyl proteins, making the Nisssle 1917 invade into tumor cells, and avoid cell lysosomes endocytosis. After the Nissle 1917 enter solid tumor cells, another plasmid will express TAT protein, inducing cell apoptosis. The specialty of our project is that if the Nissle 1917 enter the nontumorous cells by mistake, the third plasmid will start suicide program, which will not pose a threat to normal cells, achieving the safety of gene therapy.

Subsequently, we will link some specific inducible promoters of heavy metal ions to this reporter and transform these devices into Escherichia coli BL21 to verify the feasibility of the reporter and construct engineering bacteria that can rapidly detect heavy metal ions in aqueous solution.
https://teams.igem.org/2361	Food & Nutrition	During the fermentation process of dairy products, such as cheese and yogurt, fermentation bacteria are under constant threat of bacteriophages. Severe infections can result in inferior product quality, wasted processing time and expensive countermeasures. Our team has developed IMPACT: Integrated Modular Phage-Activated CRISPR Tracer. Built in Lactococcus lactis, this bacteriophage detection system consists of two specialized orthogonal CRISPR mechanisms. The first continuously surveys incoming bacteriophage DNA and isolates spacers from it, while the other enables transcription of a signal-gene when a spacer is matched to the pre-programmed target array. To facilitate use, we have developed a closed detection cartridge and bioinformatic algorithms for determining new target sequences. Our product offers rapid on-site detection without techniques that require highly trained personnel. Our goal is to have a positive impact on industries all over the world that depend on fermentation processes and contribute to a better understanding of bacteriophage infections in general.
https://teams.igem.org/2362	Environment	Plant-based biosensors have immense benefits over analytical chemistry or potentiometric techniques because they continuously sample a large volume of the environment, provide warning to laypeople, and achieve the amazing specificity and sensitivity of biomolecules. We are developing two approaches to biosensing contaminants with plants. Both systems are based on important developments in biosensors, namely the creation of synthetic signal transduction systems in bacteria and plants and the redesign of natural periplasmic binding proteins for the detection of new ligands. Taken together, these advances could allow a computationally-designed periplasmic binding protein which binds a contaminant of interest extracellularly to transfer the signal through a phosphorylation cascade and produce a transcriptional response. We will create circuits to implement these synthetic signal transduction systems, attempt to computationally design periplasmic binding proteins for new ligands, and test the efficacy of our two biosensing approaches.
https://teams.igem.org/2363	WIKI	Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are a class of man-made organic chlorine contaminants. Although their manufacture has been banned, they remain in the environment today. PCBs are probable carcinogens and toxic; cause immune system and thyroid defects; and its biomagnification up the food chain in the Puget Sound has been particularly detrimental to orcas. Though they persist because they are highly nonreactive, it has been known for several decades that PCBs slowly degrade in the environment. Recently, it was discovered that the bacterium Dehalococcoides mccartyi can break them down with a variety of enzymes, the genes for which were sequenced in 2014 by Wang. However, D. maccartyi is anaerobic and obtains energy through organohalide respiration. We planned to transform these genes into easier-to-work-with E. coli for potential PCB cleanup operations. The end goal was a process using the produced enzymes or technology containing the genetic pathway for use in PCB clean-up operations.
https://teams.igem.org/2364	Therapeutics	Engineering of transcriptional/post-transcriptional synthetic circuits and optimization of delivery systems to transfer them into mammalian cells could revolutionize the development of programmable cellular responses towards a plethora of applications in health and disease. We are developing pANDORRA, an assembly platform for modular RNAi-based logic circuits, capable of integrating multiple endogenous inputs to classify a cell by its miRNA expression profile and trigger a biological actuation. As a proof-of-principle, we are employing this strategy to build a cell-type classifier for colorectal cancer cells inducing fluorescence and/or triggering apoptosis. Simultaneously, in order to design a multi-pronged treatment approach for colorectal neoplasia, we are engineering a novel anti-cancer E.coli agent, facilitating selective adhesion and cell density-dependent invasion into cancer cells, as the delivery module for our classifier circuit. In the future, we envision our system to be employed in a variety of pathological conditions generating reporter signals or protein outputs of therapeutic potential.

Fusarium Graminearum predominates among several Fusarium species that can cause FHB. Deoxynivalenol (DON) and zearalenone (ZEN) compounds, produced by Fusarium that are common contaminants which pose a threat to human and animal health. So the main purpose of our project is to prevent FHB&#65292;not only inhibit growth of the F. graminearum&#65292;but also degrade DON and ZEN . We choose to have mass production of biological pesticidesantifungal peptide using yeast system and engineer Yeast-based biosensor to detect. Considering biosafety&#65292;our project also includes a kill switch, which is responsible for preventing gene contamination. The mammalian Bax protein will confer a lethal phenotype when expressed in yeast. This reassures that the yeast removes itself when it was exposed to the environment.

It could be a self-fixed co-cartelized system for industry,cell 3D culture for research and even 3D printing tissue for medication.
https://teams.igem.org/2367	Therapeutics	Celiac Disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder that affects approximately 75,000,000 people around the world. The disease is triggered by the ingestion of gluten, a protein found in wheat. Common symptoms are abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, and malnutrition. The current practice for treating Celiac Disease is strict adherence to a gluten-free diet. Gluten-free diets are difficult to maintain, diminish the quality of life of CD patients, and on average are 242% more expensive than diets that contain gluten. We are proposing a new approach in the prevention and management of CD where patients are able to enjoy foods that contain gluten through population of the gut with engineered therapeutic cells. The cells will be able to: 1) Degrade gliadin, a peptide in gluten that elicits an inflammatory response 2) Sequester gliadin by binding it to the surface of the therapeutic cells 3) Sequester zonulin, a hormone responsible for enhancing inflammation.

Sweet receptor brothers, T1R2 and T1R3 are living in a galaxy that is under the threat of sweet monsters who want to rule the galaxy. The sweeter sweet monsters are, the more powerful they are. So the sweetness of every one of them is essential information. Although the brothers are born with the ability to swallow sweet things, they are too weak to fight with so many enemies. So they ask a battle master SC84117 who lives in planet JB486 for help. And they send their gene sequence to SC84117. After reading the sequence, SC84117 transforms into a spaceship with T1R2 and T1R3 brothers. Since then, they travel all around the galaxy to swallow sweet monsters and measure the sweetness of them. They are regard as heroes and there is a name for them, which is Sugar Hunter.
https://teams.igem.org/2369	High School	Cancer, a genetic disease resulting in uncontrollable cell growth, is mostly caused by somatic mutations acquired throughout an individuals lifetime. Because it induces the increased expression of growth related genes, oncogene amplification is one of the driving forces of cancer cell replication. Recently, it was discovered that some oncogenes resided on extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA). Like the DNA on chromosomes, ecDNAs are double stranded. A key difference, however, is the circular shape of ecDNAs; they are able to randomly distribute because they do not have centromeres, which increases heterogeneity in daughter cells. This can cause the cancerous tumors to develop faster resistance to current treatments. To target the ecDNA, we used CRISPR technology to create double strand breaks specifically in the ecDNA. Because ecDNA causes oncogene copy number to increase exponentially, utilizing CRISPR to create breaks in ecDNA decreases cancer cells replication speed.

https://teams.igem.org/2371	High School	Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death worldwide. The technique of liquid biopsy is much better than the popular biopsy as it obviates pain and complication incurred to patients by detecting various tumor markup, including short strand circulating tumor DNA (CtDNA) in the blood. However, it still requires laboratory apparatus such as PCR instrument.Thus, our project uses paired dCas9 protein links with split T7 RNA polymerase, guided by SgRNA to carry out the procedure. DCasentry not only deals with low CtDNA concentration in blood but also capable of producing various kinds of signal output. We adopt freeze-dried paper chip as our vector of detecting system to simplify its operation as well as storage. The product will be presented as a kit containing all items necessary for detection and can be widely use on the medical field.
https://teams.igem.org/2372	Therapeutics	The rising amount of microbial resistances urge for innovation and new therapeutics. Many substances already available in the lab are potent as antibiotics but cannot be used in humans due to toxicity or problems in delivery. Therefore, we used aminocoumarins and created a new derivative via a semi-biosynthetic synthesis approach. The introduction of specific modifications changes the pattern of interaction with proteins while also improving the chemical properties of aminocoumarins. Our modification specifically targets ß-lactam resistant pathogens. For proof of principle, we developed a suitable test system consisting of an E.coli-based pathogen model and a toxicity assay. Additionally, we performed an in silico prediction of changes in binding affinity to target proteins. In conclusion, we created an antibiotic that is only activated by ß-lactam resistant pathogens itself via enzymatic cleavage while not affecting other cells in the human body - the advanced Trojan horse is set free.

And many pests also have a negative impact on agricultural production. Our project is focusing on addressing the growing number of pest-induced disasters and outbreaks by changing sexual orientation. We use Drosophila melanogaster as chassis organisms, and use the classic UAS/Gal4 system to regulate this character. Whats more, we also build models to simulate the effects. Compared to other traditional ways, this method is heritable and continuable, and causes less impact on the ecosystem. In addition, the gene will be activated in summer, when pests thrived. We hope that our project will provide a new way to solve the problems caused by pest.
https://teams.igem.org/2375	Environment	Zebra mussels have a large impact locally in Minnesota as well as nationally. Zequanox is a new effective treatment composed of heat-killed Pseudomonas fluorescens, and it is very expensive. The Minnesota iGEM team has proposed a novel synthetic system that is based upon a toxin released by this Pseudomonas fluorescens strain, cytolysin FitD, that could be released into lakes. This designed system entails the creation of a modified Escherichia coli strain that expresses FitD and a biomolecular control system to allow for the release of live bacteria into the lake. With the continuous production of the FitD toxin, an increased number of zebra mussels will be killed, limiting the number of treatments needed. Minnesota iGEM experimented with several biocontainment strategies, including a thymidine auxotrophy system, purine auxotrophy system, SacB control system, and toxin activation system. These control mechanisms help to create robust and safe engineered biological systems for environmental applications.
https://teams.igem.org/2376	Environment	Reprocessing paper is very important for reducing deforestation, but the current manufacturing process causes chemical pollution and substantial paper fiber losses. After extensive discussions with paper-making experts, we have devised a plan to replace the chemicals used in traditional paper reprocessing and to increase recovery of paper fibers. In our model, the paper sheets undergo image analysis to determine which spots have ink printed on top and will be sprayed with Saccharomyces cerevisiae which has been engineered to express deinking enzymes upon light induction. Instead of treating all paper pulp, only the spots with ink is shone with light to induce localized deinking. This procedure can remove ink efficiently while protecting most of the paper fibers from being digested. This design extends the lifetime of the paper fibers and reduces wood-logging for making paper.

In addressing this challenge we focus on RNA interference (RNAi), a novel molecular technology that used for gene knockdown, which has been showing great potential in agriculture field especially for insects control, Meanwhile we notice that many weeds are the hosts or intermediate hosts of pests. Based on these two observations, we are aimed at using synthetic biology to control weeds and pests at the same time. We selected model organism Arabidopsis as basic plant verification system which has clear genetic background and field pests Aphidoidea are chosen to be discussed as well in our experiment.
https://teams.igem.org/2378	Environment	Polyethylene terephthalate (PET)-based plastic pollution in the ocean is a very concerning environmental issue. These plastics are extremely difficult to degrade. Moreover, harsh ocean environment breaks down these plastics into tiny fragments called microplastics. Microplastics are commonly ingested by marine life, causing poisoning which could lead to deaths. While larger-sized plastics are easy to collect for recycling, microplastics are impossible to collect, making them an untreatable pollution. ITB_Indonesia team will create a synthetic bacterium which has the ability to remove plastic pollution from the ocean efficiently. This bacterial machine will do its action in four main steps: 1. detection of microplastics; 2. attachment to the microplastics through biofilm formation; 3. plastic degradation using PETase enzyme; 4. conversion of PET-degradation products into nutrition source. Additionally, this bacterium will be designed to survive marine conditions. Through this breakthrough, microplastic pollution would be treated and marine wildlife would be saved.
https://teams.igem.org/2379	Foundational Advance	Synthetic biologists over the years have regulated protein expression using two types of regulators - transcriptional and translational. While transcriptional regulators are easily composable and are capable of regulating multiple genes(operons) and complex genetic circuits, they are difficult to engineer. On the other hand, translational regulators are not capable of regulating multiple genes and complex genetic circuits but can be easily engineered de novo using predictive thermodynamic models. Hence an ideal regulator is found wanting, one which is capable of regulating multiple genes simultaneously and at the same time easily engineerable. ReguloGEM provides such a regulator based on the tnaC operon. This regulator termed the Adaptor is capable of converting the translational regulatory property of riboswitches into transcriptional regulation. The Adaptor will be tested using temperature and pH sensitive riboswitches. We have also built a machine learning based tool that is capable of predicting the strength of sigma 70 promoters.
https://teams.igem.org/2380	Manufacturing	Over the course of the last decades wound infections have become a major issue in daily medical routine. In this context we present a method combining continuous wound screening with next generation wound care. To accomplish fast wound screening, we introduce a tool to detect individual bacterial proteases. Here, non-toxic fluorophores are linked to chitosan oligomers by sequence-specific peptide linkers within a hydrogel matrix. This method excels by being painless, quick and non-invasive. Chitosans show antimicrobial and wound-healing supportive properties, making chitosan oligomers excellent plaster materials and fluorophor-carriers. De novo biosynthesis in E. coli makes it possible to produce chitosan oligomers with different defined deacetylation patterns which differ in their bioactivity and are therefore useful for various applications for instance plant protection and medical materials. For this purpose different chitindeacetylases, with unique deacetylation patterns can be individually expressed in E. coli by orthogonal regulation via a split-T7-RNAP regulation system.

In this project, we proposed a cell synchronization approach based on a synthetic circuit of light-controlled CRISPR system targeted at OriC to block the initiation of chromosome replication in E. coli cells. Under the control of computer, the cell cycles can be synchronized with tuned lightening patterns. Our synthetic biological approach of cell synchronization has multiple advantages than traditional methods and may become a fundamental tool for biological research.

We would create a device which could detect the amount of aflatoxin inside the food, then transmit the information on to the internet. Therefore both the public and private sector could use the device and mobile application to track contaminated food throughout the nation. Secondly, we would like to create a enzyme-encoded yeast to eliminate the aflatoxin in the patients intestine.We would create a yeast that could produce enzymes that eliminate the aflatoxin inside the human intestine. This can help people suffering from the diarrhoea caused by aflatoxin. Additionally it can also be applied to animal foods, getting rid of the aflatoxin in the animals bodies that could potentially contaminate our food.

The detection should be visualized by discriminating the alteration of three chromoproteins (cjBlue, RFP, BFP) expressed by E. coli with the regulatory circuit of temperature and UV light. We aim to build up a quantitative experiment for observing the color of E. coli. For the practical application we aim to place E.coli on stickers and attach the stickers on the product before delivery, thus able to monitor the whole process of transportation. DETECOLI alerts consumers to possible deterioration or contamination by changing color, and serves as a guarantee of quality.

Phosphate-solubilizing bacteria have important functions. In our project, we used the mechanism of the alliance between microbe and plant, by manufacturing Bacillus megatherium, which is a kind of phosphate-solubilizing microorganism exists in the root system, forcing it enhance the plant remediation from two aspects, accumulating heavy metals and defend adversity stress. To achieve the goal of spatial specificity, we make most of the expression system which is regulated by root organic acid. We also used MBP (metal binding peptide) to make accumulation of heavy metal in root systems soil success. Finally, heavy metals will transfer to plant itself. A series of transformation we made in Phosphate-solubilizing microorganism in our project will solve the weakness of hyper-accumulators, therefore, the remediation method will be put into use widely.

We have been depleting the worlds resources and filling the atmosphere with abnormal levels of CO2 for too long. Our team has decided to take on this challenge by creating photosynthetic cell factories, to directly use the pollutant CO2 as a resource for synthesizing fumarate - a versatile chemical traditionally manufactured from petroleum. We aim to stably produce, sense and export fumarate under conditions mimicking industrial settings. Stable production is achieved by activating and evolving different metabolic modules in response to natural day/night cycles. To detect fumarate, we developed a biosensor suitable for high-throughput screening. Finally, to allow optimal fumarate export, we investigate its transport mechanism. These efforts attracted attention from beyond academia, as our cell factories may help in taking CO2 out of thin air and into a bio-based economy.

Previous methods of fuel harvest have relied on destructive means of extraction, but we aim to upregulate the excretion of lipids, allowing for potential harvest by physical separation. Our goal is to enhance the algal lipid production and extracellular transport in Nannochloropsis oceanica, a well characterized species with high lipid content. This will be achieved by upregulating the endogenous lipid production enzymes of the cell with high expression promoters and transfecting algae with an ATP binding cassette transporter from Arabdopsis thaliana. Next steps will include developing a system to physically separate excreted lipid from the algal biomass, while maintaining a productive continuous culture.
https://teams.igem.org/2387	Village	Over the last two decades epidemics of infectious diseases have caused major harm to the world population. These outbreaks often originate from developing countries, where diagnosis can be problematic. The Mantis project aims to detect antigens in blood samples of patients using an in vivo bacterial system, allowing for efficient diagnosis even in rural areas. Mantis is fast, robust, modular, and requires little equipment. Moreover, the whole-cell system allows for more affordable production and longer storage compared to current systems. Detection is based on affinity bodies, an antibody mimetic that can be produced by bacteria. Through rational design, the system can be adapted to detect a wide range of pathogens. The addition of the affinity body to a bacterial receptor will rapidly generate a clear fluorescent signal, measured by our portable, 3D-printed diagnostic device directly in the field. This way, Mantis will help diseases come to light.

https://teams.igem.org/2389	WIKI	Protein therapeutics are a front line approach to treatments for cancer, infections, autoimmune disorders, and other diseases. Developing new protein-based therapeutics require methodologies, particularly directed evolution, that enable the engineering of protein-protein interactions with high specificity and affinity. Due to the iterative mutagenesis required for directed evolution, optimizing protein interactions can become tedious. To enhance enrichment of desired variants Team UAlberta designed a protein-protein interaction assay based on the reconstitution of adenylate cyclase in Escherichia coli to accelerate screening for successful variants. We have built two constructs to act as reporters for our system. The first contains genes required for gas vesicle formation and bacterial buoyancy while the second encodes for fluorescent proteins. Our current efforts are focused on characterizing and validating our system using well-characterized protein interactions and our reporters.
https://teams.igem.org/2390	Measurement	Enabling the ease of access to proper nutrition is vital for developing a healthy human population. Understanding the elements of nutrition will aid in engineering solutions to current -and future- nutrition concerns. One set of vitamins where deficiencies are presently a concern, especially among pregnant women, are vitamins B9 and B12. The primary goal of this project was to characterize and document riboswitches responsive to vitamins B9 and B12. Five riboswitches regulated by either vitamin B9 or B12 were selected and synthesized. E. coli were engineered to express the mRNA regulating GFP expression constitutively using the well-documented promoter BBa_J23106. The GFP expression when exposed to varied levels of the ligand were measured over time through fluorescence measurements, and the binding affinity of the ligand to each riboswitch was determined through isothermal titration calorimetry. These data and subsequent documentation will aid in providing a usable, documented part for further use.
https://teams.igem.org/2391	New Application	Advances in synthetic biology have lead to new, useful metabolic pathways that can be used to produce metabolites on a commercially-viable scale. However, management of these cultures is time-consuming and labor-intensive, and measuring levels of metabolites often involves prohibitively expensive analytics, such as HPLC. Our project aims to overcome these problems by providing a low-cost, automated turbidostat bioreactor that analyzes a yeast culture in real time and corrects inputs to maintain culture conditions. To test our system, we use the violacein metabolic pathway, regulated with inducible promoters, to yield four visually distinct pigments. An open-source Raspberry Pi computer collects color and opacity information about the culture, and software analyzes the color and gradually introduces the inducers to keep the culture’s production stable. By combining biological, software, and hardware systems, our design can generate previously-unavailable visual data in certain biosynthesis processes, and has a wide range of applications in industrial fermentation.
https://teams.igem.org/2392	Food & Nutrition	The University of Georgia’s 2017 iGEM team aims to engineer a biosensor for the detection of aflatoxin B1, a harmful mycotoxin peanut contaminant. As Georgia produces more peanuts than any other state in the United States, UGA iGEM recognizes that aflatoxin B1 contamination in peanuts is a regionally important issue. While other iGEM teams have developed detection methods for aflatoxin B1, these methods lack high specificity. To achieve a highly-specific biosensor, UGA iGEM has incorporated an aflatoxin B1 aptamer that has previously been used for an in vitro detection assay. By mimicking this system in vivo, UGA iGEM is developing a cost-effective two-component riboswitch aflatoxin biosensor. This technology could be utilized in the manufacturing process to cut costs in recognizing infected peanuts. Moreover, by creating an affordable aptasensor, this will both make peanut crop growth more accessible to developing countries and decrease aflatoxin-related deaths worldwide.

We have furthered this idea to design a four-pointed star-shaped scaffold protein using a single disulphide bond, as well as split inteins which can then be associated with different enzymes to increase modularity and allow a greater application potential. We have improved on the design by Melbourne iGEM 2016 by introducing more stable linkers between inteins and adjusting the DNA sequence to have greater accuracy and precision in expression and purification. We also propose a wide range of possible applications, specifically with respect to increasing the rate of synthesis of chemicals critical in physiological homeostasis, including dopamine, vitamin D and mevalonate.
https://teams.igem.org/2396	WIKI	Inappropriate use of antibiotics has escalated the growing problem of antibiotic resistance in many threatening diseases. In 2014, the World Health Organization classified antibiotic resistance as a global epidemic. Inactivating resistance genes via Cas9 nuclease-mediated cleavage has been shown to be an effective means of combating this epidemic; however, methods of in vivo delivery are currently limited. Our team aims to deliver Cas9 to antibiotic-resistant, pathogenic bacteria through submicron bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) as a companion re-sensitization therapeutic to antibiotic treatment. OMVs are naturally produced by all Gram-negative bacteria and are used for crosstalk, stress responses, and nutrient acquisition. Their ability to be modified and directed with relative ease makes them an ideal carrier of CRISPR-Cas9. Aiding conventional antibiotic treatment, our technology will model a complete protein delivery system and transport functional Cas9 to target cells.
https://teams.igem.org/2397	North America	Perchlorate is a natural toxin that exists on Mars at high concentrations of ~0.5-1% and on Earth at significant concentrations of ~0.15-0.25%. However, perchlorate is also a by-product contaminant of several industrial processes. Certain soil bacteria degrade perchlorate to oxygen and chloride using the enzymes perchlorate reductase and chlorite dismutase. By exploiting this two-step enzyme pathway, our team hopes to bioremediate Martian soil for future human settlement and potential applications on Earth. Last year, our high school team UrbanTundra 2016 successfully expressed chlorite dismutase in E. coli, and showed that it could convert the chlorite intermediate to chloride and oxygen. This year, our plans are two-fold: 1) to complete the pathway by expressing perchlorate reductase, a challenging problem involving a large two-subunit membrane protein requiring multiple cofactors, and 2) the design of a self-contained bioreactor for the enzyme pathway that can be used on both planets.
https://teams.igem.org/2398	WIKI	Darwinian evolution is an enormously powerful concept that drove biology towards astonishing complexity and beauty. This year, the iGEM team Heidelberg aims at harnessing this power to accelerate the engineering of biomolecules for human benefit. To this end, we built upon the PACE (phage-assisted continuous evolution) method: Synthetic biological circuits couple the survival of quickly mutating phages carrying a protein of interest to directed selection within E. coli hosts. Thereby, proteins with improved functions can be evolved within hours. We designed a standardized toolbox that highly simplifies PACE and expands its utility towards various new areas of application, including the development of enzymes for pharmaceutical production. Additionally, we applied machine learning techniques to evaluate and systematically improve protein sequences to serve a desired purpose. Taken together, we provide a new foundational advance by introducing a unique combination of in silico and in vivo directed evolution to Synthetic Biology.
https://teams.igem.org/2399	Environment	Our project for this year is developing a biosensor for alkane. As present methods dealing with oil spill cannot meet the requirement of environmental recovery, our team think that the best way solving oil spill problem is preventing it. We separated oil degradation bacteria from areas contaminated by oil, then we confirmed this bacteria is Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain by measuring its 16S rRNA and named it DN1. For oil degradation is an alternative metabolic pathway in bacteria, there is a manipulator for oil degradation gene, such as GntR. It codes GntR protein, which can bind with promoter on upstream of alkB2. When alkane exists, GntR will unbind with the promoter, and the RFP gene we added on downstream will express to show a signal. We used P.a DN1 and DH5&#945; as our chassis to explore which bacteria will be a better chassis for our device.
https://teams.igem.org/2400	Food & Nutrition	In China and Europe, substitutes for drinking alcohol, known as fake alcohol, have caused dangerous health effects in the community. One such substitute is methanol, known to cause blindness and/or death. The methyltransferase pathway exists in Methanosarcina Acetivorans, converting methanol into methane. By taking advantage of this pathway and two of its essential component, mtaB and corrinoid protein mtaC, methanol may be reduced in fake alcohol solution without affecting the concentration of ethanol. Since methane is a greenhouse gas, we stopped the biological pathway halfway at its intermediate methyl-mtaC. After transforming mtaB and mtaC into DH5&#945; strain of E.coli, the effectiveness of the pathway remained undetermined due to limitations of our gas chromatography equipment and to large fluctuations in our magenta sulfite colorimetric results. Further tests, including clonogenic assay and fluorescence counterstaining, suggest that the possibility of the E.coli being unable to survive in methanol could be ruled out.
https://teams.igem.org/2401	WIKI	Estimates from the World Health Organization predict a resurgence of bacteria to their long-lost top spot among the most devastating human diseases. How did it come to that? Since the discovery of Alexander Fleming, the first scientist that invented and proved the concept of antibiotics, over the years scientists have discovered a vast number of antibiotics to effectively treat bacterial infections. We could fight most bacterial threats for a long time which lead to a notion of false comfort that everything is under control! However, with the current overuse of antibiotics and acquired resistances among bacteria we are about to enter a new era, the post antibiotic era. We are now reaching the tipping point, at which new strategies are required to overcome multiresistance and prevent a resurgence of devastating infections. Our Project will help to combat multiresistant-infections with a Trojan-Horse-Approach utilizing gallium-loaded siderophores as a resistance-resistant therapy.

It is time for a new innovative approach in the fight against caries.

We will perform SELEX on these proteins to obtain aptamers, which specifically bind to S. mutans and prevent the formation of biofilm. And thus the formation of Caries.
https://teams.igem.org/2403	Environment	Pine-wilt disease caused by Bursaphelenchus xylophilus causes tremendous damage to pines in Asia and Europe. However, the existing counter-measures are not only insufficient, but also cause environmental and ecological damage. We engineered a solution to killing nematodes effectively and specifically by focusing on the nematode's diet: yeast living inside pines. We selected target genes which were both nematode-specific and predicted to be essential for survival. We then engineered yeast which express dsRNA targeting these genes, with the goal of feeding the engineered yeast to the nematodes to knock down their genes (feeding RNAi). Furthermore, we predict that engineered yeast may be used to colonize healthy pines, functioning as a preventive measure against nematode infestation. The behavior of dsRNA in yeast is still not well understood, and establishment of a feeding RNAi system in pine-wood nematodes is unprecedented. Thus, our method will also support fundamental research on RNAi and pine-wood nematodes.
https://teams.igem.org/2404	WIKI	Our project involves expressing the human thyroid stimulating hormone antagonist (TSHantag) protein in the tobacco Nicotiana benthamiana. Using golden gate cloning, we are generating transcriptional units for transient expression of TSHantag after agrobacterium-mediated transformation in tobacco leaves. TSHantag has been used to treat hyperthyroid disorders such as Graves Disease, but has not been produced in large amounts appropriate for therapeutic use. The TSHantag protein works by inhibiting autoimmune autoantibodies, which in turn decreases elevated thyroxine levels and reduces pathologic symptoms. In addition, we are expanding the set of tools available for regulating gene expression in plant synthetic biology. Currently, only a small number of regulatory elements have been introduced into the iGEM Phytobrick standard. Therefore, we are generating novel inducible promoter Phytobricks that are responsive to jasmonic acid, salicylic acid and damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). The efficacy of these regulatory elements will be measured using a luciferase reporter system.
https://teams.igem.org/2405	Environment	Pollutants in fresh water such as pharmaceuticals, hormones and heavy metals are rarely monitored and the need to detect and remove these compounds in an inexpensive way is what motivates this project. The marine bacterium Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 could be a part of the solution through its unique ability to transport electrons to an external acceptor such as an anode through its external electron transport chain (Mtr pathway). This can be utilized in bioelectrochemical systems to make a biosensor by removing the mtrB gene which allows electricity production then turning this gene back on in the presence of water contaminants. This biosensor will be engineered to be manufactured on a large scale to be used for research, education, humanitarian efforts and even consumer use. Although the proof of concept is currently tested in a single chambered bioelectrochemical system, an affordable and portable paper microbial fuel cell system is being developed.
https://teams.igem.org/2406	Foundational Advance	Site-specific recombination is widely utilized for genetic engineering; however, a synthetic biology approach is needed to facilitate its use in a rational and bottom-up way. Therefore, we created SMORE, a toolkit containing well-characterized recombinases, their respective target sites, and recombinase activity assay constructs, with their utility demonstrated by three constructs: a gene randomizer, logic gates, and a pulse generator. Among other applications, these could be applied to metabolic engineering to improve the industrial production of high-value compounds. Our human practices concerns the accessibility of SMORE, making it easier to use. First, we systematically reviewed iGEM team composition in previous years to determine whether diversified teams enjoyed more success; second, we built a microfluidic device and had its protocols open-sourced to promote its use outside of the discipline of engineering; lastly, we adjusted the readability of our promotional material and created animations to facilitate the understanding of the concept of SMORE.
https://teams.igem.org/2407	Environment	We developed a novel gene switcher based on the mating-type switch and the mating behavior of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, namely Mating Switcher. Two groups of MATa haploid yeast with different functional genes initially work separately. Then by activating the inducible promoter in one group, the MATa yeast in this group will become MAT&#945; yeast to mate with another group. With vika/vox system, the original function can be shut off, and new function can be launched after mating. We applied our mating-type switcher to a controllable system of heavy metal enrichment for further disposal. To realize the separation of different ions in polluted water, we designed a gene circuit enabling the adsorption of different metal ions (Cu2+, Cd2+ ) in chronological order. And thanks to the flexibility and feasibility of our mating-type switcher, there will be more applications waiting us to exploit and develop.

Second, enhancing the health benefits of wine, specifically antioxidant content, by increasing presence of reservatrol. Third, lowering the glycemic index of wine while maintaining its flavor and quality by introducing the Miraculin molecule.

MARS will comprise of designs for nine chips adapted to our low cost system that perform fundamental synthetic biology procedures, as well as video tutorials, PDFs and protocols for using these chips or fabricating your own. Furthermore, MARS includes a troubleshooting and verification framework for microfluidics allowing researchers to quantitatively grade microfluidic chip designs.

Recombinant DNA origami molecules, with hopefully (we don't know yet!) with different resonant frequencies will be bound to the surface of the cells on the mechanical sensing ion channel to control gating. We are hoping to achieve a proof of principle for the rational design of a artificial "stereocillia," the descendant of which could be used to organically restore hearing loss in humans.
https://teams.igem.org/2411	Foundational Advance	The presence of specific RNAs in cells can be indicative of their state. Detecting these RNAs on a small scale allows for identification of viruses such as Zika and Ebola, however measuring larger sets of RNA remains complex. Current methods of RNA detection are time consuming and require expensive machinery and technical expertise. Toehold switches, biological devices that drive the expression of a gene when activated by trigger RNA, present an alternative with high specificity, wide dynamic range, and ease of use. We present a platform whereby trigger RNAs activate toeholds and induce recombinase expression, driving downstream genetic logic. We integrate this RNA-inducible logic within a cell-free transcription translation system to reduce the experimental burden on time and supplies. This work serves to establish functionality of RNA-inducible logic in a cell-free system, and provides a platform for future implementation in applications that require detection of multiple RNAs, including disease diagnostics.
https://teams.igem.org/2412	Therapeutics	RNA interference (RNAi) therapies modulate endogenous gene expression in target cells through introduction of exogenous short interfering RNAs (siRNA) or their precursors, short hairpin RNAs (shRNA). Challenges for efficient and cell-specific RNAi therapies abound, like rapid renal clearance, degradation by serum nucleases, traversing the lipid bilayer and escape from the intracellular endosome. Bacteria innately colonize the hypoxic and immune-privileged cores of tumors and as such have been explored as potent delivery systems for RNAi-based cancer therapeutics. We are engineering an RNAi gene therapy, utilizing recombinant E. coli that invade mammalian cells and deliver an shRNA payload targeting the aberrantly expressed receptor tyrosine kinase EGFR and transcription factor c-Myc. Bacterial uptake by mammalian cells and endosomal breakdown are mediated by a quorum-inducible Invasin-HlyA operon. We are characterizing the circuit via gentamicin protection assays in vitro using HeLa and prostate cancer lines, and assessing target oncogene knockdown through flow cytometry and qRT-PCR.
https://teams.igem.org/2413	Environment	Lead contamination in drinking water is a major problem across the U.S. Our project aims to improve lead testing and treatment by developing a lead biosensor and colorimetric lead assay, as well as a lead-binding probiotic. Our lead biosensor improves the cost and efficiency of lead testing by producing specific chromoproteins that indicate benchmark levels of lead contamination in a sample. These benchmarks were confirmed by our assay. We are conducting proof-of-principle demonstrations of the biosensor in Escherichia coli, and will ultimately transform it into the Generally Recognized As Safe organism Bacillus subtilis. The probiotic, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, offers an emergency prophylactic solution for treatment by absorbing lead from the gastrointestinal tract after consumption of contaminated water. To achieve this, we are using selective pressure to evolve a probiotic with enhanced lead-binding capacity. Our project will improve the accessibility of lead detection and bioremediation for the general population.
https://teams.igem.org/2414	Village	In stock-breeding, animals are fed with grains that contain phytic acids though many livestock are not capable of producing phytase, an enzyme that decomposes phytic acid, and remaining phytic acid is excreted in the excrement. Excreted phytic acid flows into rivers and leads to eutrophication that causes problems such as red tide, which exerts adverse effects on ecosystem and fishery. Under the status quo, people try to cope with this problem by adding phytase to the feed of livestock however, its enzyme activity is thought to be lowered when it is heated during its production. Moreover, the low pH in the stomach of livestock may also lower its activity. In our project, we aim to increase stability against heat and extreme pH by circularizing enzyme using self-assembling peptides (SAPs) which could decrease the amount of phosphate in the excrement and enhance nutrition absorption since phytic acids chelate minerals.

In most of the cases, Aedes and Culex are the major source of suffering, and governments around the world take diminishing Aedes and Culex as priority in mosquito-related diseases control. Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bti) and Bacillus sphaericus (Bs) are natural-occurring biological larvicides that are widely used in urban area because they are environmental-friendly and economical. In our project, two mosquito toxic proteins, Cry4Ba and Mtx1, which are derived from Bti and Bs respectively, are coexpressed via transcriptional and translational fusion. The recombinant protein has higher efficiency in larvae elimination and is more extensive insecticidal spectrum than any single of them. Our project has created a new larvicide that specifically target against the larvae of mosquito, and we hope our product could keep people away from the suffering caused by mosquitoes.

https://teams.igem.org/2418	Village	Methane is a significant substance both in the environment and in the industry, thus indicating its presence has a great importance. Our aim is to develop a methane-biosensor. Our plan is to genetically modify a methanotroph bacterium (Methylococcus capsulatus) to produce lactate from methane or methanol. During its metabolism this bacterium produces pyruvate in the presence of methane. After having inserted the lactate-dehydrogenase gene, pyruvate is converted to have enough lactate for an enzymatic assay to change color when excess amount of methane is present in the environment of the bacteria. In the beginning the bacterium is cultivated in NMS medium containing methanol. For the genetic modification we use the lactate-dehydrogenase gene from Bacillus coagulans. First we transform E. coli with the cloned pMHE conjugation vector, which will transfer the LDH gene into M. capsulatus. The lactate concentration of the transformed bacterial medium will be determined with a lactate-assay.

While robotic devices improve these capabilities for industrial purposes, currently used medical prostheses can only mimic basic functions of the muscular system. Therefore, we will develop biological synthetic muscles to provide ecological friendly tissue compatible with the human body. At first, we will fabricate biopolymers with integrated molecular machines that will form a tissue capable of a muscle-like contraction. Named molecular machines are based on azo dyes, which can contract by light irradiation. These will be attached to the biopolymer matrix fabricated by Escherichia coli via biotin based catcher-tag systems. Another approach is to express both conductive and elastic P-Pili from Geobacter sulfurreducens and Escherichia coli. Alternating layers of these biopolymers form the dielectric elastomer actuator and the resulting biological tissue can respond to an applied voltage.
https://teams.igem.org/2420	Therapeutics	AHL is a quorum-sensing molecule secreted by bacteria and is essential in biofilm formation.

Antibiotic resistance is emerging as a world crisis with the NHS spending roughly £1 billion just on treating nosocomial infections. Multidrug resistant (MDR) gram negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas in particular are emerging as increasingly problematic bacterial species, especially in secondary infections. Therefore, we are aiming to develop strategies to help counter biofilm formation from the molecular level using synthetic biology, with the specific genes ppuR, ppuI and RsaL in Pseudomonas Putida being involved in the formation of the quorum sensing molecule AHL. A Biosensor can be developed to identify and decrease production of AHL, causing decreased biofilm formation and an increased sensitivity of the bacteria to antibiotics.

Current companies engineering bacteria to overproduce 3-HP utilize high-performance liquid chromatography to assay concentrations, which is a precise method for established bioreactors but time-consuming for testing experimental strains. Recent studies identified 3-HP responsive genes in <i>Pseudomonas denitrificans</i> and <i>Pseudomonas putida</i>, which could be used as a viable biosensor for real-time monitoring of 3-HP concentrations in vivo. Our ongoing research project utilizes the 3-HP responsive genes found in <i>P. putida</i> and <i>P. denitrificans</i> as biological reporters which express luciferase in the presence of 3-HP. We will then adapt this system to <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>, which has shown potential as a 3-HP producer for industrial processes due to its high tolerance for concentrations of 3-HP that are toxic in other microorganisms. Our biosensor is a useful tool for metabolic engineering research.

Pichia pastoris, a strain of yeast often used in this field, lacks a centromeric plasmid, which limits the research that can be done with this species. The University of Chicago iGEM Team, GeneHackers, is conducting research to create a centromeric plasmid for Pichia pastoris. Such a plasmid that will be useful for a multitude of purposes, including bioengineering and industrial applications. We aim to find and incorporate the minimal sequence within the genome of Pichia pastoris that allows our modified version of the iGEM plasmid psB1C3 to behave as part of the yeast’s chromosomes. The combination of DNA from both E. coli and Pichia pastoris will lead to the creation of a yeast centromeric plasmid that can act as a shuttle vector between the two organisms.
https://teams.igem.org/2429	Foundational Advance	Alternative splicing is the eukaryotic mechanism that selects which exons will be included in processed mRNA. It increases the diversity of the human proteome by allowing more than one protein isoform to be produced from the same gene. The inclusion or exclusion of particular exons is regulated by splicing factors which bind to specific motifs in the pre-mRNA. Our project aims to control alternative splicing by using the RNA-binding proteins dCas13a and Ms2 to interfere with these splicing factors binding, allowing us to control which exons are included in the final processed mRNA. By choosing between different protein isoforms, this control method may allow synthetic genes to dynamically change functionality. It also has therapeutic potential for diseases that arise from aberrant splicing, including an aggressive form of breast cancer where one splice variant produces a nonfunctional tumor suppressor, contributing to tumor formation.

https://teams.igem.org/2431	Foundational Advance	Production of recombinant proteins has enabled or improved the treatment of numerous diseases including anemia, diabetes, and cystic fibrosis. However, recombinant protein production requires industrial infrastructure and the biologics produced in this manner typically have stringent storage requirements, including refrigeration. Many areas of the world lack infrastructure for local production or cold-chain infrastructure for effective delivery of recombinant proteins. Cell-free manufacturing based on freeze dried protein expression reaction pellets may be a solution. These pellets contain the molecular machinery to manufacture proteins and can withstand variations in temperature and humidity. Cell-free expression in this context has limited ability to produce complex proteins. Our project uses anti-microbial peptides as model molecules in order to characterize limits of cell-free expression of functional molecules. We then attempt to expand the production of functional molecules by introducing proteins for post-translational modification of expressed anti-microbial peptides to rescue functionality and demonstrate improved cell-free expression.
https://teams.igem.org/2432	Foundational Advance	Tremendous potential lies in engineering the microbiome, like recognizing and metabolizing toxic compounds the host cannot. Using the Drosophila gut as our model host and E.coli as our microbiome component, we developed techniques to engineer the gut microbiome. The E. coli was engineered to fluoresce GFP or RFP when induced by arabinose, its localization in the gut confirmed by fluorescent microscopy of dissected gut. To increase uptake of e. coli, it was mixed with bakers yeast, thus coexistence of 3 species was required to deliver the bacteria to fly gut, When continuously fed, the bacteria remained in the gut, but removing bacteria from food led to a gut residence time of E. coli of 24 hours. The work showed the resistance of the host to establish a foreign persistent microbiome; future work would involve engineering a more native bacterial species such as Lactobacillus to increase gut residence time.
https://teams.igem.org/2433	Village	A single species of bacteria is responsible for many plant diseases - Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Infection with this bacteria causes bizarre growths and tumors on plants that repurpose the plant cell to reallocate its nutrients to the bacterial cell, causing plant death and agricultural loss. In Agrobacterium, the ability to infect a plant is contained in a tumour inducing plasmid which can spread through conjugation between cells. Here we have constructed aGROW, a strain of Agrobacterium capable of disarming pathogenic Agrobacterium and remediating infected soil. We have armed aGROW with a stable plasmid carrying a CRISPR/Cas9 system programmed to remove a key virulence region of the tumour inducing plasmid. Our plasmid employs a separate conjugation system to carry itself through a population of Agrobacterium, preventing them from becoming virulent. We envision this system to be adaptable in disarming other virulent plasmids such as those found in Shigella, Salmonella, and E. coli.
https://teams.igem.org/2434	Village	"PHAgave" aims to synthesize polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA), a form of bioplastic naturally produced by bacterial fermentation, from the available carbon sources in residues from the tequila production process through a recombinant E. coli strain. The study compares the metabolic speed for the PHA synthesis between Pseudomonas putida KT2440 and a recombinant E. coli with the genes for PHA synthesis (ACC, fabG, phaG, phaC1 and phaC2) for a continuous bioplastic production. This stage also includes the extraction of the PHAs from the intracellular medium in a more sustainable way than a chemical lysis.The main objective is to make the process efficient, clean, and with a high yield. The obtained bioplastic has multiple applications; for example, it can be used for the creation of disposable laboratory equipment and containers due to its resistance to heat and oils. A business model for the commercialization of our bioplastic is included.
https://teams.igem.org/2435	Energy	Pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) and alcohol dehydrogenase 2 (ADH2) are key enzymes for mediating ethanol production from pyruvate. A particularly well-characterized PDC-ADH system has been found in Zymomonas mobilis, and this pathway has been used to engineer a variety of bacteria for ethanol production. In some cases, this pathway works well, resulting in high levels of ethanol production. In other cases, however, the pathway does not work very well. To understand this, we aim to develop a set of BioBrick compatible expression vectors with different plasmid replicons to allow expression of the PDC-ADH pathway in a range of different bacteria. Organisms expressing the PDC-ADH pathway will be assayed for PDC and ADH activity by enzyme assay and for ethanol production by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). These new expression plasmids will be useful for other groups looking to expand their BioBrick engineering beyond the confines of current model or "chassis organisms.
https://teams.igem.org/2436	High School	The Baltimore BioCrew seeks to eliminate plastic pollution, specifically the pervasive issue of microplastics, through a sustainable, innovative mechanism. In comparison to other efforts, our focus is shifted from the macro to the micro by utilizing microorganisms to degrade polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Prior research has identified a Japanese bacterium, Ideonella sakaiensis, that can degrade PET plastics. We designed, synthesized and expressed two genes from I. sakaiensis encoding the enzymes, PETase and MHET, in E. coli. We are currently examining the activity of these enzymes and the ability of our engineered E. coli to degrade PET and produce benign byproducts with potential industrial uses. We plan to utilize the enzymes secreted by our engineered E. coli to degrade microplastics in controlled environments such as a bioreactor, and in doing so, ridding the Baltimore Inner Harbor of plastic pollution.
https://teams.igem.org/2437	Diagnostics	Everybody poops. A stool analysis is a cheap and useful pre-diagnostic tool for many human diseases by chemical and biological examinations of daily stools. For instance, the colon cancer can be pre-screened by checking the presence of occult blood in feces. However, the procedure of collecting samples and delivering it to the laboratory often makes people cumbersome and therefore causes a delay of the examination. This year at iGEM, team KUAS_Korea presents POO-robiotics, a do-it-yourself (DIY) stool analysis at home. We employ Lactobacillus plantarum L67 as a chassis, a probiotic with antiallergic activity and used as a yogurt starter. The designed genetic circuit will convert bowel conditions into color pigments. As a proof of concept, we focused on the screening of occult blood, pH variation, and bile salt residues. After ingesting our POO-robiotics, individuals can identify their own bowel conditions at home by simply checking the color of their feces.
https://teams.igem.org/2438	Food & Nutrition	Our team will try to make a new technology called LAM (Lactic acid mediated) communication utilizing GAR+ prion. GAR, or glucose associated repression controls the usage of glucose of yeast. In 2016, it was proved that this pathway is managed by the certain amount of lactic acid. Lactic acid produced by lactic acid bacteria, affects the prion formed gar- and induces the formation of GAR+. Considering this mechanism and terminators of fission yeast and regulating the amount of mRNA of GFP and anti-GFP, we will enable yeast to communicate each other beyond the species of gram-negative bacteria and make a biosensor to sense hiochi.
https://teams.igem.org/2440	Foundational Advance	Nowadays, sequence-specific microRNA (miRNA) inhibitors have been extensively demanded in miRNA loss-of-function studies and gene therapies, whereas current developed inhibitors still suffer from high cost and poor scalability. Seen new approaches needed, our project attempts to demonstrate a novel design of miRNA inhibitor, named as miRNA locker, which can be easily assembled using modularized DNA parts from a set of chemically synthetic oligo DNA library. The microRNA lockers we assembled were proven to be able to bind miRNAs in an Ago2 dependent manner, and were able to trigger gene expression and phenotypic changes consistent to commercialized miRNA inhibitors while decreasing costs significantly. We also demonstrate a computer-aided designing software to facilitate the lockers design and optimization. With its unique advantage and potential on multi-targeting and convenience, we believe that our design might provide an alternative approach for miRNA inhibiting for research, diagnostic and therapeutic uses.
https://teams.igem.org/2441	Environment	Heavy metals, also known as trace metals, are one of the most persistent pollutants in waste water. Biological remediation processes are indicated to be very effective in the treatment of heavy metal pollutants in waste water.The over-expression of metal binding proteins has been widely exploited to increase the metal binding capacity, tolerance or accumulation of heavy metals in bacteria and plants. An expression level of transgene/gene of interest depends upon strength of promoter. Hereby in our project we are focusing on over-expressing the "Top-4 metal binder protein" (iGEM part BBa_K1478002) and "Human Metallotheonin 3" by strong synthetic promoter designed by employing bionformatics tools which would be suitable for expression in microbes and plants. We will fabricate bio-beads by immobilizing, bacterial cells which strongly expresses our cloned metallotheonin. Our fabricated beads allows fast, easy and user handy purification of industrial waste water which can be further use for irrigation purpose.
https://teams.igem.org/2442	Food & Nutrition	Food contamination and improper handling of raw poultry is the leading cause of food poisoning in the U.K. Campylobacter jejuni is native to poultry but is highly pathogenic to humans and cross-contamination of surfaces and other foods is common. The current detection methods are time consuming and costly and therefore we aimed to create a new cheaper, faster system for detection of this bacteria using synthetic biology. We designed and engineered a dual input biosensor using sensory aspects including campylobacter-specific sugars and quorum sensing to identify any C. jejuni present on a swabbed surface. We also developed an understanding of the legal aspects of using GMO biosensors within the EU. In the future, our biosensor is a potential solution in reducing the risk of food poisoning from Campylobacter.
https://teams.igem.org/2443	Foundational Advance	We aim to develop a standardized, modular, and open-source ex vivo transcription and translation (TX/TL) system available for research and teaching communities worldwide. Ex vivo systems provide several advantages to cell-based platforms, including: simple input and output, non-proliferation, precise control of molecular interactions, and incorporation of unnatural amino acids. Thus, ex vivo systems are highly useful tools in making synthetic biology accessible to novices, providing enthusiasts with inexpensive cell-free synthesis, and empowering experts with modular control over robust expression systems. With our end-users in mind, we have designed, modelled, and built a plasmid-based multi-protein parts collection for the stoichiometric expression of all required biomachinery for coupled TX/TL reactions, as well as a novel purification method that makes these parts readily available from an inexpensive single-step elution. Lastly, we have created a software tool to preempt biosecurity challenges associated with genetic recoding in ex vivo systems.
https://teams.igem.org/2444	Therapeutics	The gut microbiome is an exciting field of research that has increased exponentially across the past few years. Many studies have found a correlation between imbalances in the gut microbiome and disease states. Can altering the gut microbiome at all change disease state? In order to evaluate this question, methods are currently needed that can allow researchers to make targeted manipulations to modulate the populations of specific microbes within a microbiome. The goal of our project is to overexpress bacteriocin genes (toxins that bacteria produce that affect other bacteria) in E. coli. The rationale for our methodology this year is to answer questions similar to "how much of a specific bacteriocin is needed to reduce the abundance of a single microbe by 60%?" Our intention is to generate data that will be used in computational modeling and future experimental projects towards developing gut microbiome therapeutics.

https://teams.igem.org/2446	Therapeutics	Antigen density on tumor cells surface is heterogeneous, which constrains current solid tumor immunotherapy to target only highly expressed tumor associated antigens (TAAs). We designed an antigen density targeting immunotherapy platform, SwordS (SynNotch-Stripe system), that is capable of generating non-monotonic therapeutic responses. To demonstrate the concept, we took advanced-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), one of the most common malignant tumors and a leading cause of cancer-related death in China, as a potential target of disease treatment by SwordS. In combination with HCC associated antigen responding SynNotch, our genetically engineered cells would generate an antigen density-dependent, triple HCC therapeutic response patterns. Our approach is aimed to reduce the on-target/off-tumor effects and greatly expand the diversification and combined potency of tumor therapy. We believe that SwordS is promising to become a brand new generations customized therapy developing platform for optimizing cellular immunotherapy against cancerous diseases.
https://teams.igem.org/2447	Foundational Advance	Many SynBio groups are engineering microbes that could one day be useful in detecting diseases, fighting cancer and monitoring heavy metals in rivers. However, engineered microbes may leak into non-designated environment, posing threats to our natural ecosystem. This is a major hurdle towards the commercialization of engineered microbes. To address this, we need effective kill switches to prevent engineered microbes from escaping into the environment. However, existing kill switches have limitations and, more importantly, it is difficult to readily tailor make kill switches for different applications. Team NUSgem aims to make engineering of customised, effective kill switches easier. To this end, we are developing a library of characterized sensors, a killing and verification module which can be used in a computer aided design tool (e.g., Cello) and can be readily modelled. As a proof of concept, we focus on developing kill switch for engineered probiotics for human health.
https://teams.igem.org/2448	Food & Nutrition	The World Health Organisation recognized obesity as a serious illness so we decided to consider ways to combat its spread and effects. This is how we came across D-Psicose, which is a non-toxic rare sugar and a sweetener with several measurable health effects. Currently, its industrial production is based on purification from organic matter or on epimerization of more common sugars but it remains difficult and expensive. To improve the bioproduction process, we decided to construct a biosensor to screen the best epimerase for the conversion of Fructose into Psicose and corroborate the fluorescence quantifications with HPLC measurements. To be efficient any bioproduction process requires screening of the most efficient enzyme(s). We are bringing to iGEM a new enzyme screening process based on biosensors, which, in the presence of the compound of interest, emit a fluorescent signal and can be used to identify the enzyme that gives the optimal production.
https://teams.igem.org/2449	WIKI	The PowerLeaf introduces a novel solution for long-term storage of solar energy, thus becoming an alternative to solar cells. This is accomplished without the use of environmentally harmful resources. The device is designed to resemble a plant leaf, which is meant to provide a nature-in-city ambience. This hypothetical implementation of the PowerLeaf in an urban environment, was developed through public engagement and collaboration.The bacterial solar battery is composed of an energy storing unit (1), and an energy converting unit (2). The energy storing unit (1) is defined by a genetically engineered Escherichia Coli, which fixates carbon dioxide into the chemically stable polymer cellulose. A light sensing system activates dormancy during nighttime, to reduce energy lost by metabolism. The energy converting unit (2) uses genetically engineered Geobacter Sulfurreducens to consume the stored cellulose. Retrieved electrons are transferred by optimized nanowires to an anode resulting in an electrical current.
https://teams.igem.org/2450	Diagnostics	Our project seeks to find a synthetic biology solution to the problem of diagnosing Chagas disease, a neglected tropical disease. Caused by the parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi, it is endemic to much of Latin America. Chagas disease claims over 12,000 lives per year, yet remains difficult to diagnose in its treatable acute phase. Existing diagnostics require highly-trained personnel and expensive equipment. Our solution is to develop an accurate, low cost, and portable cell-free diagnostic kit that detects the presence of cruzipain, a protease specific to T. cruzi. We have developed, modelled, and tested two designs: (i) a cell-free DNA circuit-based diagnostic utilising the TetR repressor system and (ii) a protein-based outer membrane vesicle (OMV) diagnostic using the SpyTag/SpyCatcher system for localisation of our parts to the outer membrane and a split-protease-based protein circuit to amplify the signal. We believe this method will be applicable to numerous pathogens with specific proteases.
https://teams.igem.org/2451	WIKI	Crude oil processing produces toxic byproducts, such as benzene, toluene, and xylenes (BTX) capable of contaminating groundwater and soil leading to potentially serious health risks for both humans and wildlife. Thus, the effective removal of these hazardous organic compounds is imperative towards protecting natural resources. While it is possible to manually clean contaminated sites, such efforts are costly and time consuming. Our project seeks to degrade the toluene-based contaminants into valuable aromatic aldehydes by expressing the xyl ortho pathway from Pseudomonas putida in E. coli. As a continuation of our 2016 project, the 2017 UT-Knoxville iGEM team aims to use synthetic biology and metabolic engineering techniques to further develop our bioremediation strain. First, regulatory elements sensitive to the presence of aromatic hydrocarbons are engineered to fine-tune protein production. Second, overexpression of broadly specific efflux pumps intend to increase organic solvent tolerance and alleviate toxic effects. And third, exploring enzymatic homologs can expand our product library. Our project aims to increase production titers and develop a more robust microorganism suitable for manufacturing and bioremediation needs.
https://teams.igem.org/2452	Environment	Escherichia coli infection is a common problem when water resources such as drinking water, beaches, or irrigation systems are contaminated with human waste. Infections by these bacteria can lead to severe gastrointestinal problems and even death if left untreated. Therefore, it is necessary to have water testing methods that can rapidly and accurately determine whether water sources contain these harmful pathogens. The WLC-iGEM team is working on developing a water testing kit that provides fast and accurate results using components of the Lambda Phage tail that are specific for their target bacteria. These bacteriophage tail components have been cloned and will be purified. By attaching a horseradish peroxidase enzyme (that will produce color when a substrate is added) to these bacteriophage components, E. coli should be able to be detected when present in a water sample. The high specificity and high concentration of bacteriophages should provide accurate and rapid results.

We are rewriting nature’s code for endosymbiosis and transforming an evolutionary phenomenon into a technology compatible with standard biological parts. Our vision is to produce synthetic host–endosymbiont systems. We set out with a trinity of experiments intrinsic to the synthetic reconstruction of endosymbiosis. First, creating and sustaining dependence between a host and its endosymbionts by fulfilling the amino acid requirement of an auxotrophic host. Next, to build a modular system of cell-penetrating peptides for protein transport of host nuclear encoded proteins into an endosymbiont, recapitulating a crucial feature of the natural process. Finally, regulating the number of endosymbionts within a host using a CRISPR-Cas system for control of replication. Further ahead we see a safe, customisable, sustainable technology providing biological solutions to present and future challenges in biotechnology, agriculture and medicine.

However, the current market price for such devices creates a high barrier of entry for many institutions. To make this key technology more accessible, the Penn iGEM team (2017) strives to create an open-source and cost-effective solution. The KAM-Spec is a ~$2K dispersion-based plate reader (up to 96 wells), in which full absorbance and emission spectra are rapidly resolved on a CCD line-array camera. KAM-spec automation and analysis is performed in Python. KAM-spec performance will be benchmarked using commercial fluorophores and common fluorescent bacterial strains used in synthetic biology and optogenetics.
https://teams.igem.org/2457	Village	The building block of Synthetic Biology is to turn biological systems easier to engineer. Standardization is a fundamental key to that goal. CRISPR/Cas9 machinery paves the way for precisely edit living cell genomes. Although revolutionary, SynBio community has an obstacle: CRISPR/Cas9 protocol is superficially standardized and requires a considerable amount of wet lab work due to the multi-plasmid system. We aim to build a toolbox for one-step genome engineering based on a standard BioBrick vector. To go further and beyond, we unified human practice with pattern recognition and machine learning in order to overcome boundaries in the way of SynBio advancement. We also bring the concept of computational repository for lab "algorithms", the protocols, developing an open and integrated platform to expand the iGEM experience. Our perspective is to leave a legacy and provide a bacterial genome editing machinery based on BioBrick parts assembly easy to engineer as A-B-C CRISPR.
https://teams.igem.org/2458	Village	While its causes are still unknown, Parkinsons disease is currently associated with the lack of dopamine in particular regions of the brain. Presently, one of the most common treatments for Parkinsons is the prescription of levodopa tablets, which increases dopamine levels by introducing dopamines chemical precursor, levadopa to the body. Our project involves building DNA circuits that produce and regulate levadopa using bacteria rather than pills. One plasmid focuses on the production of levadopa, E. Coli with HpaBC gene, and another regulates and monitors the first plasmid, E. Coli with a multigene assembly that includes a transcriptional factor, PP2551, which will increase levels of levadopa production when IPTG is introduced. We have a Venus fluorescent protein assembled into the sensing plasmid so that we are able to visualize and measure the amount of levadopa produced.
https://teams.igem.org/2459	Information Processing	Our project is based on "The Maze Runner", where Thomas experienced the maze in constant change. How he reached the exit can be abstracted as classics of Graph Theory. Using the theory of biology, we designed experiments for stimulation and through means we found several feasible paths. It's the extension of our project in 2014 and 2016, the difference is: this project is an analogy of the maze, and can be extended to many practical fields. In detail, we combined experimental design with theoretical analysis. Firstly, we used computer processing for theoretical analysis of specifics in the movie. Then, we utilize biology-related instruments and provided materials to process sequence by trail and error. Finally, we extend related methods to other practical fields. The project not only has theoretical values: solving a math problem, but also bears broad application prospects, so it can be considered as an alternative for information processing.
https://teams.igem.org/2460	WIKI	Biological memory can be defined as a sustained cellular response to a transient stimulus. Although the existing memory devices can be highly diverse and delicate, they can only record the static state at the instant the recording action happens, therefore, they do not have the ability to monitor the dynamic changing process of one signal. This year, we want to development the concept of cellular memory, and to realize the monitoring of one changing signal. So, we design a unique memory device with sequential structure using recombinases. After we measure the orthogonality and efficiency of our recombinases, we try to engineer our E.coli population to record several static states of the target signal at different time point. Thus, by putting these results together in the right time order with our recombinase-based sequential system, we can finally get an idea of how the signal changes as time goes by.
https://teams.igem.org/2461	Environment	The excessive production of methane by cattle is harmful to both the environment and the cattle industry. The reduction of nitrate to nitrite by the rumen microbiota has been shown to compete with the methanogenesis process for hydrogen. Nitrate is an effective feed additive, but in large quantities it causes nitrate poisoning. To combat this we have engineered E. coli to express a nitrite reductase protein. When introduced into the cows' gut microbiome, it will make the cows resistant to nitrate poisoning. Seaweed has also been found to effectively reduce methane emissions when used as a cattle feed supplement. Bromoform was found to be the compound in seaweed that inhibits methanogenesis. We studied the possibility of producing bromoform directly in the cows’ gut by engineering E. coli to produce a bromoperoxidase enzyme. In further efforts we hope to replace recurring feed additive purchases with a one-time inoculation of food-grade bacteria.
https://teams.igem.org/2462	Environment	Widely used in agriculture and various industries, synthetic phenolic compounds commonly exist in wastewater and have been troublesome in wastewater treatment due to their remarkable stability and acute toxicity. They can accumulate through food chains and serve as mutagens and carcinogens to people and other organisms. Among them, halogenated phenolic compounds are notablely more toxic and less bio-degradable. Even when the number of halogen atoms increases, the toxicity of the whole molecule is raised as well . To deal with this serious problem, our team aims to construct a Hybrid Membrane Bioreactor to assist the degradation of halogenated phenolic compounds in wastewater. In this device, we intend to apply an engineered Bacillus megaterium which can mainly express an original reductive dehalogenase RdhANP. And we will also make some genetic changes on this B. megaterium to scale up its efficiency in treating the wastewater containing halogenated phenols.
https://teams.igem.org/2463	WIKI	By providing a well-defined, biocompatible surface coating, the risk of bone and dental implant failure will be greatly reduced. We aim to accomplish this by controlling the spatial production of extra-cellular cellulose with light. Our modified E.coli builds on previous teams work, utilising a transmembrane protein complex, which upon exposure to red light, phosphorylates a promoter and initiates the synthesis cascade. Using this technology, our team will be able to build a 3D printer where living bacteria act as the bioink. Our team will then be able to produce cellulose structures, featuring micrometer pores, which mimic the surface of broken bone, for implants. This structure has been shown to promote osseointegration, helping to reduce overall failure rates.
https://teams.igem.org/2464	WIKI	Our project focuses on developing a lateral flow assay-based Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) for inexpensive, early-stage, point-of-care diagnosis of HIV and Zika. Treatment access and public health interventions for these diseases are seriously limited by diagnostics, as current RDTs detect either poorly-conserved viral antigens or the patients own delayed antibody response and thus are unable to reliably diagnose early-stage infection, while more sophisticated tests are not widely accessible where the disease burden is greatest. Our novel approach enables modular, early-stage detection within an inexpensive, scalable RDT format by using a lectin to detect carbohydrates universal to a number of important viral pathogens in combination with antibodies targeting virus-specific conserved sites. Additionally, we have rationally engineered a thermostable variant of the diagnostic lectin to improve manufacturing economics and device robustness. By enabling earlier and larger-scale diagnosis, we hope this approach will help to improve interventions for these critical global health challenges.

Bacteria resistant to antibiotics emerged shortly after their initial use, and is an increasing problem as pathogenic strains of bacteria evolve resistance to multiple drugs. In an effort to increase antibiotic susceptibility, we will use CRISPR/Cas9 technologies to disrupt intrinsic resistance mechanisms in E. coli. Specifically, we plan to enhance the expression of Omp pores while also inhibiting the functioning of AcrAB-TolC efflux pumps. Mechanism for effective delivery of a functioning CRISPR system in clinical settings will be explored.

Search results are classified into different categories so users will acquire various information efficiently on project overview, description, team awards and so on. The searching engine of BioDesigner Dolphin also allows users to find gene information and explore gene relationship. Besides information acquisition, users are also able to design biological parts with the help of recommendation. We hope BioDesigner Dolphin will improve the working efficiency of researchers and give inspirations to iGEM teams when deciding theme and methodology of their projects.
https://teams.igem.org/2467	Environment	Sulfate Reducing Bacteria (SRB) cause significant damage to marine oil pipelines necessitating the use of biocides for reducing the Microbial Induced Corrosion (MIC) and potential for great environmental harm. Our team will focus on developing an eco-friendly approach to limit the use of biocides, which are used for targeting the SRB. SRB require high salt and low oxygen so first we plan to genetically engineer a strain of bacteria that would report the osmolarity in oil pipelines, thus act as a biosensor for salt concentrations. The ratio of salinity in the seawater flowing in versus the seawater flowing out of the well will be used to estimate SRB populations in the pipelines, thus limiting the amount of biocides added in times of high Microbial counts. In order to further reduce the environmental impact, we will inactivate the biocides prior to the oil well water being released back into the ocean.
https://teams.igem.org/2468	Manufacturing	The aim of this project is to lower the cost of a common recombinant DNA technique, the Gibson Assembly. The concept revolves around the construction and expression of plasmids with DNA polymerase and DNA ligase as the insert genes. The constructed plasmids for these two proteins are transformed into DH5α cells for high cloning and then transformed into BL21(DE3) for high gene expression and production of the proteins of interest. Cell lysate from transformed BL21(DE3) cells is used as DNA ligase and DNA polymerase and the base level of exonuclease present naturally in the cell lysate serves as the T5 exonuclease. Using different combinations of the cell lysates for the DNA ligase and DNA polymerase, a plasmid with known sequence and properties is assembled to test the concept. Sequence results obtained after each trial are recorded as a measure of success or a need to modify the lysate ratios.

Using blue light as an input, our tool will enable users to manipulate desired gene outputs. As a proof of the utility of our switch, we propose a system that will permit spatiotemporal control of CRISPR activity using blue light. By integrating anti-CRISPR proteins and sgRNAs as our outputs, we demonstrate the applicability of our design to CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology. Given the foundational nature of our project, we have devised a guide that will aid researchers in considering the ethical, legal and socio-economic implications of the various applications of our system. Using human gene editing as an example, we aim to create a framework that facilitates reflexive dialogue, incorporating feedback from various potential stakeholders.
https://teams.igem.org/2470	Diagnostics	Current point-of-care diagnostics for bacterial infections are costly, time-consuming, and offer limited strain specificity. These challenges contribute to improper antibiotic usage, accelerating the propagation of antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) bacteria. We are developing DNAzymes - catalytically active ssDNA generated via in vitro selection - to serve as inexpensive and sensitive probes for the rapid detection of AMR bacteria. In the presence of targeted strains, the DNAzyme cleaves a fluorophore-RNA-quencher motif at the RNA site, generating fluorescence. As a proof-of-concept, we have adapted a known E. coli K12 DNAzyme for use in a plate-based assay, and are generating a novel DNAzyme to detect resistant strains of C. difficile. Simultaneously, we are leveraging machine learning techniques to predict potential DNAzymes, and are developing kinetic models to describe DNAzyme behaviour. Our project addresses the need for novel approaches within AMR detection and active antimicrobial stewardship  issues widely recognized by the experts in this field.
https://teams.igem.org/2471	Environment	Erwinia amylovora causes fire blight disease worldwide in some important crops such as apple, roses, pear and most Rosaceae's family members. For example, the largest Latin American apple producer has 3,000 hectare from which 50% are estimated to have the disease. This iGEM edition, Tec-Chihuahua presents its proposal to address this environmental/economical issue by using synthetic biology techniques to synthesize three enzymes that might inhibit most, if not all, of the virulence factors. The use of N-Acyl homoserine lactonase would directly affect the AHLs by hydrolyzing the main quorum sensing molecule. Then, the Cyclic-di-GMP phosphodiesterase would linearize the c-di-GMP avoiding the formation of biofilm while encouraging motility. Nevertheless, Tec-Chihuahua proposes to arrest flagellar rotation with a glycosyltransferase. As these are intracellular proteins, the pathogen should be genetically modified and tested hoping for a descent. Afterwards, the commercial and technical viability of a theoretical biocontrol would be developed as real proposal.

And when it comes to application, resilience of these organisms is an important factor that needs our attention. Hence this year, our project seeks to improve the stress resistance ability of engineered organisms. Our solution was built upon Tardigrades, an organism famous for their extraordinary ability to survive in harsh conditions. The resilience comes from some unique protective proteins. We express these proteins in vivo, test its ability to increase the survivability of bacteria under water deficient and radiation conditions, eventually it will be used on eukaryotic cells like yeast, multicellular organisms like nematode or even mammal cells and organs. Our products can be easily used by many teams whose engineered organism have to work in extreme environments, with numerous potential use such as in culture collection and protection of transplant organs.

The second part of the project is to evolve cell permeating peptides specific for skin cancer cells (A375) through phage-surface display random peptide library. We will eventually fuse the novel Bcl-2 mRNA binding peptides and mRNA cleaving DNAzymes with Cell-specific Cell Permeating Peptides (CPPs) to develop Bioconjugates which can target cancer cell through the CPP and inhibit the Bcl-2 protein expression through the novel Bcl-2 mRNA binding peptide and mRNA cleaving DNAzyme to induce apoptosis of the cancer cells. The work has a special significance as we try to boost the global efforts of developing "Complete" Drug molecules/Bio-pharmaceuticals; which can inhibit the target (Drug Action), guided by a CPP to Deliver the Oncogene-Inhibitor inside Cancer cells (Drug Delivery).

The four chaperones called GroEL, GroES, DnaK and Trigger Factor are going to be studied, both on their own and in different combinations. These chaperones will be overexpressed in Escherichia coli together with Tau and Amyloid Beta fused with the fluorescent proteins eGFP and mNeonGreen. These fusion proteins will also be expressed in different conditions where parameters such as temperature, expression time and induction strength is varied.
https://teams.igem.org/2475	WIKI	Prions are perhaps most famous for their implication in neurodegenerative diseases. However, there are also proteins that bear strong similarities to prions while not being associated with an infectious disease. These proteins have been deemed “functional prions.” Here, engineered functional prions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae provide a proof of concept for using prions as a tool in synthetic biology to co-localize different proteins. These engineered proteins have prion-like aggregative behaviour, as well as a fluorescent tag. They will be used to test the viability of using engineered prions to bring and keep proteins in close proximity to each other while maintaining their function.
https://teams.igem.org/2476	WIKI	Real-time controllable nanorobots are an attractive goal of engineering and robotics. However, current nanorobots are limited by the precision of control: most utilize magnetic or electric field based steering. Yet, light-based control through laser technology, offers precise spatial resolution at the diffraction limit. We seek to modify the chemotactic machinery of E. coli by modulating the activity of the critical chemotaxis protein CheY. The GFP-related protein Dronpa has been demonstrated to reversibly block kinase activity through light-induced dimerization [Science 2017, 355, 836-842]. Our team has designed a novel Dronpa-CheY fusion protein to precisely control the movement of E. coli with different wavelengths of light. Since Dronpa controls CheY activity directly, the effects after exposure to light will be rapid, compared to cases controlled by gene regulation. The control of E. coli that can be precisely driven on the micrometer-scale may revolutionize targeted medical treatment, bioanalytical sensing, and nanomanufacturing.
https://teams.igem.org/2477	Environment	Panama disease, caused by the fungus Fusarium oxysporum, poses a major threat to the world's banana population. Experts confirm that the most common banana cultivar could be wiped out, resulting in major agricultural and economic consequences. Our goal is to combat F. oxysporum with transgenic bacteria that sense fusaric acid, a toxin released by F. oxysporum, and respond by producing and secreting thaumatin like protein (TLP), an antifungal agent found in plants. Transferring the final genetic circuitry to Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, a symbiont associated with the roots of the banana plant, will provide a soil additive capable of protecting banana crops from this threatening disease. This system can be tuned with a Cas9 mutagenesis screening method we developed. Finally, to increase awareness of the role of synthetic biology in protecting food and water, we fabricated an inexpensive “lab-in-a-box” system suitable for high schools along with a bacterial based metal detection system.
https://teams.igem.org/2478	Measurement	The most commonly used input signals in iGEM generally include chemicals and light. Temperature-based input signals are not used as frequently and remain a reservoir of potential for future synthetic biology tools. Our project explores the characterization and standardization of thermosensitive ion channels, known as TRPV1, to function as a thermal actuator and regulate calcium-sensitive gene expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. At the activation temperature, gating of the thermal actuator allows for an influx of extracellular calcium ions, which initiate the calmodulin-calcineurin signaling pathway, and promote the expression of genes regulated by Crz1p-sensitive promoters. The characterization of the thermal actuator was conducted in S. cerevisiae because yeast offers an accessible eukaryotic chassis for other iGEM teams to work with. By varying the temperature, the thermal actuator can be used to control genetic circuits that function as temperature-sensitive kill switches, drug delivery devices, or biosensors.
https://teams.igem.org/2479	Environment	Ammonia released from hydrolysis of urine is a major reason for the stench in public toilets. Apart from being a put-off, ammonia is also hazardous. Current approaches to tackle this problem include flushing water, using microbes (BioBlocks®) that break down urea in urine to prevent its hydrolysis, and using air fresheners. The first approach requires using copious amounts of water, which is not abundantly available in many parts of the world, while the second is not cost-effective. Finally, spraying air fresheners is not a solution, as it does not get rid of ammonia. We propose to engineer Escherichia coli to assimilate ammonia and convert it into indigoidine, a blue colored compound. Ammonia from air can be dissolved in an aqueous medium and can act as a nitrogen source for the engineered cells that maybe housed in a cassette; the synthesized indigoidine will indicate when the cassette has to be replaced.

https://teams.igem.org/2481	High School	Printer ink is a commodity that is used on a daily basis. The current pigments used to colour conventional inks are environmentally harmful to produce. Our goal is to produce biological pigments by putting the biosynthesis pathway genes encoding for black, cyan, magenta, and yellow pigments into Escherichia coli. Using synthetic biology to produce pigments may provide a cleaner and safer alternative to conventional pigment manufacturing. Costs of manufacturing methods can be compared and pigment production yields can be modeled mathematically. Pigments purified from bacteria are combined with a solvent and resin to create an ink mixture. Consultation with potential stakeholders indicated that pigments and inks produced by this method would need to be tested for bleaching, bleeding and colour consistency, among other characteristics. Additional human practices include analyzing the environmental impact of standard pigment production versus bacterial production and presenting iGEM and STEAM initiatives to members of our community.
https://teams.igem.org/2482	Village	Infections with the pork tapeworm Taenia solium present without symptoms initially, but may cause severe long-term complications like blindness and epilepsy. The disease is endemic in rural Africa, Latin America, and Asia. Currently there is no suitable diagnostic screening test available to identify patients in need of treatment. We set out to develop such a test using toehold switches that generate a visible color reaction on a paper test-strip upon binding of specific tapeworm RNA. We have established SOPs to screen toehold switches using in silico design, nested PCR, and cell-free expression. First sensor candidates show positive results and we succeeded in immobilizing our detection system on paper strips. We have organized a conference with over 150 participants, providing a forum for leaders from academia, pharmaceutical companies, NGOs, and members of the German Parliament, to raise awareness about neglected tropical diseases and to win scientific and financial support.
https://teams.igem.org/2483	Foundational Advance	With metabolic channeling, the speed of the reaction of a metabolic pathway is raised by putting the enzymes close together, thus the diffusion distances for the intermediates are reduced. Therefor we have two approaches. In the first approach, we are utilizing the DNA-binding property of the dCas9-protein to put the enzymes next to each other on a DNA-scaffold. The proteins bind via Aptamers and specific binding proteins to dCAS9. This approach is tested in E. coli while the second one will be implemented in yeast. The second approach works with liquid-liquid-phase separation. In this process, membraneless organelles are formed, induced by specific variable domains of Ddx4. We want to investigate, whether fusing the enzymes for the pathway with Ddx4 enables droplet formation and thereby induces metabolic channelling.
https://teams.igem.org/2484	Village	Biofilms are often maligned because of their roles in antibiotic-resistant infections and dental plaque. However, biofilms also offer an attractive platform for the design of self-assembling biomaterials programmed for specific functionality. The amyloid protein CsgA accounts for the majority of the proteinaceous component, curli nanofibres, of Escherichia coli biofilms. CsgA has been shown to be tolerant of C-terminal fusions, allowing CsgA endowed with diverse peptide domains to be secreted and self-assembled extracellularly similar to normal curli nanofibres. We present the genetic engineering of CsgA to create a biofilm that binds ice and degrades hydrocarbons. A type I antifreeze protein, AFP8, will be fused to CsgA for ice binding, and a PA-14 adhesin domain will be fused, via the SpyTag-SpyCatcher system, to bind the hydrocarbon-degrading bacterium Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus. Thus, the end-product will be a bifunctional biofilm capable of establishing itself on Arctic ice to degrade toxic hydrocarbons present in oil spills.
https://teams.igem.org/2485	Manufacturing	Planetary exploration requires a balance between preemptive planning and financial feasibility. The risk of mid-mission equipment failure, power shortages, or supply depletion incentivizes precautionary measures, but the financial strain of sending unnecessary mass into space limits this practice. To balance the two, our team explored the advantages of biological solutions, namely the self-sustaining abilities of low-mass organisms, to make planetary exploration more self-sufficient and economical. Prioritizing repair over replacement, we are developing self-healing materials embedded with Bacillus subtilis. For longer-lasting energy, we are designing a biobactery using linearly oriented E. coli to generate power. For renewable materials, we are engineering bacteria to synthesize and degrade rubber. Individually, these projects offer sustainable alternatives for repair, power, and materials. But when combined, these consolidated insights can provide us with the power to get to Mars and resources to sustain us while were there.
https://teams.igem.org/2486	New Application	Paratransgenesis can be defined as a set of strategies to eliminate a pathogen from vector populations through the usage of genetically modified symbionts, thus controlling vector-borne diseases. For our iGEM Project, we have focused on generating a versatile molecular toolkit for endogenous detection and elimination of mosquito-borne pathogens. We have selected Pantoea agglomerans, a ubiquitous bacterium which is enriched in the midgut microbiota of anophelines, as a novel chassis for targeting malarial parasites. Two coupled genetic circuits have been designed (i) for sensing malarial infection biomarkers in the blood ingested by mosquitoes and (ii) for subsequent production/secretion of anti-Plasmodium synthetic peptides. A third module, consisting in an endogenous bacterial killer-switch was designed to control the population dynamics of the genetically engineered symbiont. This is the first study combining the conceptual frameworks of both paratransgenesis and Synthetic Biology, bearing great potential for the generation of novel approaches for combating mosquito-borne diseases.
https://teams.igem.org/2487	Environment	The WaterHub at Emory University is a wastewater treatment plant on campus that utilizes bacteria and plants to recycle 400,000 gallons of water a day for non-potable use. The Emory iGEM team has utilized synthetic biology to try to help optimize their system by developing a phosphate accumulating organism that can help them combat the high orthophosphate levels in their wastewater. We have created a number of experimental strains of bacteria with variations in polyphosphate kinase and exopolyphosphatase expression. Their phosphate assimilation rates and growth rates in waterhub sewage with an added carbon source were tested. We have also created a phosphate sensor that takes advantage of a natural phosphate sensing mechanism regulated by promoters called pho regulon. This sensor will allow the cells to indicate when phosphate rates have been lowered by our engineered bacteria.

As producers serving as capsules for phytase molecules and protecting them from high temperatures we will use Yarrowia lipolytica. In order to protect phytase from degradation when affected by enzymes of yeast cells we will modify the protein attaching another protein  phytochelatin  to one of the ends of the protein chain. Phytochelatin has a very stable and compact structure resistant to yeast enzymes and will serve as a barrier between phytase and such destructive enzymes.
https://teams.igem.org/2489	WIKI	Co-culturing of microorganisms is an extremely promising approach, in Biology, for understanding natural and synthetic cell population interactions, and for applications in Industrial Biotechnology including manufacturing and drug research. However, the maintenance of stable and productive co-cultures is technically challenging, expensive, and can be time consuming. We aim to develop a Digital In-line Holographic Microscope (DIHM), along with associated software, that will be able to monitor co-culture counts in a closed loop, in real time, and inexpensively. To complement the microscope, we will also develop a synthetic co-culture. This comprises Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Escherichia coli, two visually distinct organisms. Chlamydomonas will be engineered to export maltose to feed E. coli, creating a sustainable production platform. We believe that our DIHM and co-culture is a promising start to streamlining the development of co-cultures for industrial applications.
https://teams.igem.org/2490	Manufacturing	The University of Guelph’s project focuses on the development of an enzyme-based cleaning method for the removal of calcium oxalate scale (commonly called beerstone) from the inside of beer brewing vats. Beerstone is incredibly insoluble and difficult to remove, with common cleaning methods involving the use of caustic acids. Our team hopes to use the enzymes Formyl-CoA Transferase (FRC) and Oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase (OXC) from Oxalobacter formigenes’s oxalate degrading metabolism to break down beerstone. This year’s aspect of the project focused on cloning frc and oxc into E.coli DH5a using pET-28a. This required conducting site directed mutagenesis to add the PstI cut site to the pET-28a vector. Future experimentation will include cloning into BL21, expressing and characterizing FRC and OXC, and the development of an enzyme-based cleaning solution.
https://teams.igem.org/2491	High School	Crude oil is composed of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), compounds that are difficult to degrade and environmentally harmful. It is crucial to find a time and cost effective procedure that will catabolize some of the most prevalent, toxic PAHs -- fluorene, phenanthrene, and naphthalene -- to innocuous compounds, such as salicylate and phthalate, which are degradable in metabolic cycles. Certain bacteria contain intermediates in their degradative pathways that simplify gene combination and nucleotide sequencing. We proposed a novel methodology for the degradation of multiple PAHs through the implementation of these bacteria-derived pathways into E. coli. This methodology allows broad spectrum transformation of PAHs within an oil environment into safer residues. A broad host vector can be used to transfer the sequences degradation capabilities into strains different from E. coli. These bacteria can be incorporated in oil spill remediations and bioreactor use, achieving detoxification through combinatorial genetic bioremediation.

What is the determination of the formation of behaviors and how to control it? Taking the response to alcohol of C.elegans as an example, a platform of optofluidics is established to provide deeper insights into these questions. Expression of two channelrhodopsins in the olfactory receptor neuron pair provides worms with the preference and aversion to specific wavelengths, and the lights are employed to reinforce their addictive or abstemious attitude to alcohol. The neo-behaviorism theory is expected to be verified in C.elegans, demonstrating the learning capability of model organisms based on both behavioral observation and quantification at the molecular level. Hopefully, downstream neurons of the new-learned behavior will be revealed by using this platform, and it depicts a future of training human brains through optogenetics.
https://teams.igem.org/2493	WIKI	Current chemotherapeutic agents trigger apoptosis non-specifically and induce cell death within healthy tissues. We propose a novel therapeutic using a bacterial vector that expresses acyl-homoserine lactone C12, the Pseudomonas aeruginosa signalling molecule known to induce cancer cell apoptosis through a Bcl-2 independent pathway. Upon detection of hypoxia and low pH, known tumour microenvironment markers, C12 will be released by the bacteria containing our genetically engineered circuit to act as: (1) a cytotoxic agent that induces cancer cell death, and (2) a signalling molecule that coordinates actions between bacterial colonies. Furthermore, the quorum sensing properties of C12 have been manipulated to activate a kill mechanism that arrests bacterial growth upon destruction of the tumour and the ensuing loss of its microenvironment. Thus, we propose constructing a genetic circuit that not only removes tumours, but also self-regulates itself to mitigate the risk of bacterial infection in the absence of cancerous cells.

https://teams.igem.org/2495	Diagnostics	Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) is one of the leading causes of food-borne illnesses. Shiga toxins mode of action involves the inhibition of protein synthesis, consequently leading to cell death. While most countries have stringent food safety regulations to prevent the sale of contaminated foods, small scale manufacturers often do not have the access, time, or resources to ensure the safety of their food. Therefore, the aim of this project was to design a cost-effective, portable device that can readily detect the presence of STEC. The device functions by lysing the bacterial cell wall and amplifying a STEC-specific gene sequence using loop-mediated isothermal amplification. It is envisioned that the use of this device in the developing world would be an effective means of reducing the incidence of food-borne illnesses.

Currently available therapy for CD patients, permanent gluten-free diet(GFD), has drawbacks of restricted nutrition and lifelong remission. Thus, we considered a non-dietary therapy that utilizes synthetic biology targeting the gut microflora. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4(DPP-4) gene, which is known to decompose the gluten, was inserted to the iGEM provided vectors through infusion cloning based on the 3A Assembly method. Western blot analysis using Flag-tag was conducted to verify the expression of the target gene. Because excessive expression of DPP-4 may induce stress and inflammation, we added Anderson promoter that differentially regulates gene expression in three levels to achieve optimal expression of DPP-4 of an individual. The transformed dominant gut bacteria can be embedded into a bacteria-favorable yogurt for the subsequent probiotic administration. This study proposes a potential novel treatment of gluten-related disorders through recombinant gut bacteria

Our microbial system is targeted on producing and secreting enzymes to break down hair, fat and other pollutants. By optimizing the secretion of the selected enzymes, we are avoiding enzyme purification which can save valuable money and time. Additionally we want to produce a scent from the existing waste as an indicator of successful degradation. Involving mathematical modeling of enzymatic kinetics and degradation processes will support the experimental work. Concluding, we hope to reduce chemical waste and deal with an everyday problem more sustainably.

Chicken feathers are mostly comprised of keratin, a strong, fibrous protein that can not be degraded by the likes of conventional proteases such as bromelain, pepsin, or papain. Failure to remove these feathers can lead to extreme health, as well as environment, related issues involving the transmission of diseases such as Avian Flu (H5N1), a disease that can wipe out chicken populations, and also has the potential for devastating effects on humans, having killed approximately 60% of all humans who have been afflicted with the disease since 1997. Our project works to develop a safe, environmentally-friendly solution to this problem involving implementing keratinases kerA & kerBPN into DH5-Alpha E. coli through transformation and assembling a prototype which allows for the degradation of the keratin in the aforementioned feathers.

https://teams.igem.org/2500	Therapeutics	Treating cancer remains a challenge for modern medicine. Current treatments are often invasive, time-consuming and limited by toxic effects on healthy tissue. An ideal therapeutic should be effective, safe and targeted. We engineered a non-pathogenic strain of E. coli to approach this goal. The combination of autonomous targeting, visualization and externally controlled toxin release provides a novel non-invasive, quick and safe approach to treating cancer. Specifically, following intravenous administration, our E. coli preferentially populates solid tumors due to the properties of the tumor microenvironment. Intracellular accumulation of the cytotoxin azurin and the MRI contrast agent bacterioferritin is controlled by an AND gate which is activated once a population threshold is reached AND lactate, a tumor marker, is present. However, azurin release happens only if the physician confirms the correct localization of the bacteria via MRI and subsequently heats them via focused ultrasound, which activates a thermo-inducible cell lysis system.

https://teams.igem.org/2503	Manufacturing	Sophorolipids are a group of amphipathic compounds synthesized by yeasts, including our selected chassis Starmerella bombicola. These compounds are among the most industrially viable biosurfactants. As surfactants, sophorolipids are superior to current synthetic alternatives largely due to their low toxicity and ready biodegradability. Anti-cell proliferation and anti-microbial assays suggest that medium-chain length sophorolipids possess therapeutic potential. However, their higher cost of production poses a major barrier to commercial use. Even when grown on a substrate largely composed of fatty acids, a significant portion of the fatty acids are diverted from sophorolipid production due to competition with the &#946;-oxidation pathway. Fatty acids diverted into the &#946;-oxidation pathway undergo irregular cleavage, lowering sophorolipid yield and creating a heterogeneous mixture of products. Full suppression of this pathway would result in undesirable metabolic disruption. Selective suppression of this pathway through genetic engineering could reduce production costs through improving the yield of useful chain lengths.

An interesting therapy for cancer using anaerobic bacteria as a carrier has been developed, but after the anaerobic cancer region is diminished, the bacteria cannot stay there anymore. If anti-cancer bacteria can stay in affected area, they promptly respond to cancer recurrence. Co-existence of bacteria and host cells should be quite difficult in our body or human cell culture systems, because bacteria grow so fast. It is important to control bacterial proliferation in them. So, we try to establish a new living system that human cells control the population of bacteria by engineering the both cells by creating two signaling pathways of 1) Bacteria-Mammals and 2) Bacteria-Plants. We expect that this system will lead to a new experimental approach and a new medical therapy.

To solve the problems existing in the current treatment of RA, we design and build a brand new immunotherapy. FOXP3+ regulatory T cells(Tregs), which can suppress and regulate immune reactions, are modified utilizing a lentiviral vector system to express a chimeric antigen receptor(CAR) targeting inflammatory cells associated with RA. Meanwhile, we insert the Syn-Notch receptor to activate the functional stability pathway of Tregs in the inflammatory environment, which enables them to play their role of immunosuppression in lesions more efficiently and more stably. These two redirections of the two different but interrelated systems on Tregs ensure this novel therapy a promising anti-RA effect.

The aim of our project, BrightBiotics, was to create a cheap, rapid and user-friendly way to faster advise healthcare professionals, on what antibiotics to use. Our device, the BrightBiotics System, does this by measuring bacterial growth, as turbidity, in the presence of different antibiotics. Once the patients sample has been prepared and put in the device, photodiodes detect changes in turbidity, and the data is sent via WiFi to the Cloud.

A peptide fused with RSA and GFP is expressed and purified as antigens for immunization and Elisa assay respectively, and this target peptide and an affinity tag are co-expressed on the surface of E.coli. Coupled with anti-tag magnetic beads, it can be used to screen and capture the desired B cells that secret the corresponding antibodies.

The main cause is a trinucleotide repeat of CAG in the huntingtin (HTT) gene, where a repeat of 40 or more can cause the disease to manifestation. Our goal is to create a synthetic RNA strand displacement technology that targets and blocks endogenous faulty mRNA and releases a corrected RNA strand for proper protein synthesis of the HTT protein. For this, we aim to generate a plamsid with an identical sequence to the human mutant form of Huntington's disease.

The capability of CO2 capturing and storage of the algae was improved by inserting foreign genes, encoding rubisco, and starch synthase.

MicroRNAs are noncoding single strand small RNA molecules which act as regulators of gene expression and control many cellular processes. Recently, miR-21 is reported to have high sensitivity and specificity in identifying colorectal cancer. Meanwhile, miR-21 can be served as a therapeutic target by targeting many oncogenes in colorectal cancer. That had inspired us of using it as the new biomarker in diagnosing and treatment of colorectal cancer.

One of the major pre-requirements for a successful directed evolution of proteins is a simple, fast and cost-efficient method for generating genetic diversity. Many technologies have been used during the years to propagate mutations. One of them is mutator strains, which carry defects in one or more of their DNA repair genes. A large number of gene knock-out, transcriptional or translational silencing methods were applied for mutator strain generation. Regardless of its great potential, the CRISPR guided dCas9 targeting to transcriptional start sites of bacterial DNA repair genes was not among them.

Pollution with chromium is a serious environmental concern in Kazakhstan since it is the 2nd largest chromium manufacturer in the world. Chromium primarily exists in two redox forms: trivalent and hexavalent. The former is poorly soluble and less toxic compared to the latter form. Hexavalent chromium is bioavailable and readily crosses membranes through sulfate transporters. The goal of our project is to collect Cr(VI) from wastewater, reduce it to trivalent form and store inside the microalgae C.reinhardtii. We are introducing chromate reductase which converts Cr(VI) to Cr(III) and oligopeptide chromodulin which tightly binds 4 Cr(III) ions. To increase chromate uptake into the cell, we are exploiting natural ability of C.reinhardtii to upregulate sulfate channels when starved from sulfur. Our safety system is represented by photosensitizing protein SuperNova. It generates ROS when exposed to 585 nm wavelength of light.

To analyze these 20 molecules, a Matlab computer algorithm is scripted to measure physical-chemical distance among them, which is then summed up to score homologous proteins. We called the program Pangu, a Chinese legendary figure, to reflect the shared-common ancestor of life on earth. We hope programs like Pangu would supplement standard methods of analyzing phylogenetic relationships between proteins and species. Guided by Pangu algorithm, we will synthesize an artificial squalene cyclase in cultured human cells to study basic physiology of cholesterol and related analogs. We hope the result will help to develop new methods to identify micro-nutrients importance for human health. Last but not least, we will continue our 2016 iGEM program iGUT, an E.coli-expressed beta-glucosidase for notoginseng processing to improve bio-availability.
https://teams.igem.org/2520	Therapeutics	Autoimmune disease and allergies are an increasingly common phenomenon in the Western world. An estimated 73 million people suffer from allergies and autoimmune disease in the United States. To date, many of these diseases lack treatment and pose an incredible financial burden on both the patients and society. We intend to design a preventative treatment for allergies and autoimmune disease by utilizing the innate system of Central Tolerance. Weve designed a plasmid based platform that will allow inducible expression and display of target antigens on the membrane of Hematopoietic Stem Cells (HSCs). Hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC-7) will be transfected with our plasmid and we will attempt to show apoptosis in an immature B cell model (WEHI-231) closely approximating the process of Central Tolerance. In the future this technology may be used to engineer HSCs harvested from cord blood and allow for a cost effective preventative treatment.

https://teams.igem.org/2522	WIKI	Every year, Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), the most common form of traveler’s diarrhea, affects thousands of deployed warfighters. The goal is to engineer non-pathogenic E. coli to sense ETEC, respond to its presence, and package it in a cellulose matrix to enable environmental detection of ETEC. We created two plasmids: ‘sense-respond’; and ‘packaging’. The sense-respond plasmid sensed Auto-Inducer 2 (AI-2), a quorum sensing molecule created by most ETEC strains, by expressing LsrR which switches on the Lsr promoter. Activation of the Lsr promoter expresses Super-Folder Green Fluorescent Protein (sfGFP), indicating the presence of ETEC. The packaging plasmid expresses a fusion protein consisting of curli fibers and cellulose binding domains. These modified surface proteins permit the bacteria to bind to cellulose, encapsulating the sense-response module. We envision this genetically engineered machine to be deployed in both the internal and external environment to detect ETEC.
https://teams.igem.org/2523	Software	Counterfeit drugs are one of the most serious problems in medicine. Not only do they prevent patients from receiving the treatment that they need, they are difficult for consumers to identify and can promote drug resistance. In order to address this problem, our team is developing a biosensor platform that can detect the presence of the antimalarial drug artemisinin. First, a genetic machine was devised that generates a large amount of protein and then rapidly lyses a cell, releasing that protein into solution. Then, a machine learning protocol was designed to determine if a protein can perform a specific function (in this case, bind artemisinin). Finally, a novel synthetic protein was added to the genetic machine to create a cheap, effective, and relatively foolproof biosensor. Because this system is not limited to artemisinin, it can be used to rapidly create a biosensor for different medications or compounds of interest.
https://teams.igem.org/2524	WIKI	Endotoxin contamination is a concern for pharmaceutical and medical devices that are intended to encounter human blood. The most widely accepted test for detection is the Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL), which is produced by harvesting the blood of horseshoe crabs and this has devastated their population. LAL detects concentrations as low as one part per trillion of endotoxins by using the natural clotting mechanism of the horseshoe crab blood in the presence of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) found on the surface of gram-negative bacteria. Factor C is a component of LAL that self-cleaves in the presence of LPS to initiate clotting. We used the cleaving property of factor C to design a novel contamination biosensor. Producing a recombinant fusion of factor C with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), will allow us to detect our system using over-the-counter pregnancy tests creating a cheaper and more efficient way to detect endotoxins.
https://teams.igem.org/2525	Information Processing	Lack of digital responses in Synthetic Biology have inhibited the diverse potential that accompanies the digitization of biological circuits. This year we aim to develop synthetic modules for signal processing in biological systems, in the form of elements of specialized logic gates based on transcriptional regulation. We move from developing near digital logic gates with sharp responses, to more specialized collapsible and reconfigurable circuits which can perform various operations like developing square pulses. Further, to realize this aim of making a square wave generator, we engineered a five node repression based ring network to give digital oscillations. Quantitative computational modelling would be used to tailor the cellular environment and observe period, steepness, noise and amplitude variations. Our project poses to be an integral element in genetic networks intended to solve scientific challenges for years to come, ranging from making light sensitive frequency modulators and bacterial memory storage systems.

https://teams.igem.org/2533	Energy	To convert optical energy into electric energy in a clean and sustainable way, Optopia is designed as a photovoltaic system consisting of photosynthetic microorganism (Rhodopseudomonas palustris) and electrogenic microorganism (Shewanella oneidensis). Synthetic biology strategies are applied to the system to trigger production and export of lactate in Rhodopseudomonas palustris, as well as to improve efficiency of lactate utilization and extracellular electron generation in Shewanella oneidensis. Compared to Cyanobacteria, also a kind of photosynthetic microorganism but generating oxygen in photosynthesis, Rhodopseudomonas palustris serves as a better carbon resource provider for Shewanella oneidensis, not only because of its anaerobic photosynthesis maintaining an anaerobic environment required for extracellular electron generation in Shewanella oneidensis, but also due to its capacity of reusing the waste from Shewanella oneidensis. Hence, functioning as a compatible and mutually beneficial optical MFC (Microbial Fuel Cell), Optopia creates a novel and optimized approach to utilize clean resources through optical-electric conversion.
https://teams.igem.org/2534	Therapeutics	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is considered one of the most common cancers and accounts for almost half a million deaths annually worldwide. Tremendous progress has been made in understanding the role of the immune system in driving the development of cancers, including CRC. As sensors of cell death and tissue remodeling, Toll like receptors(TLRs) may have a universal role in cancer. There are different TLRs that respond to a variety of Pathogen associated molecular pattern (PAMPs) such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide . The evidence of existence of relevance between bacterial microbiota and carcinogenesis is increasing. it’s suggested that microRNAs act as ligands of TLRs playing a role in epigenetic immune modulation. In this study, We will assess the therapeutic efficacy of microbiome based approach as novel therapeutic strategy in restoring normal Toll lie receptor signaling in CRC cell line .
https://teams.igem.org/2535	Manufacturing	Quorum sensing (QS) is a mechanism where bacteria detect the presence of nearby cells and coordinate their behavior among the population. Utilizing the QS genes of the Lsr operon and T7 RNA Polymerase, we are developing a biologically orthogonal quorum response sensitive to the universal autoinducer AI-2. This system introduces an alternative method of gene induction and biomanufacturing to iGEM, re-engineering microbial coordination of population phenotypes. Further, we have designed a synthetic feedback loop in tandem with the Lsr operon to increase the mean and homogeneity of quorum activation in a colony to levels comparable to industrial inducers like IPTG. This provides a system of self-regulating induction that can produce target proteins cheaper and more efficiently than current industrial methods. The resulting engineered microbe has increased biofilm production compared to the wild type, which has applications such as microbial cellulose biomanufacturing and hyper-virulent control organisms for testing certain microbial antibiotics.
https://teams.igem.org/2536	Village	We use fuel to power everything from our cars to our furnaces; however, our fuel supply is running low. As a result, we are turning to biofuels for renewable energy. We are trying ethanol, but it is inefficient, requires arable land, and pulls corn from the food supply. For this reason, our team is engineering E. coli K-12 to produce isobutanol, a biofuel with an energy density similar to gasoline. We started by improving E. coli’s resistance to isobutanol. Though E. coli can produce isobutanol naturally, its toxicity will hinder production at high concentrations. Higher resistance will allow for greater production later. We cloned the genes GlmY, EutG, and AdhP, combined them with a range of promoters, and observed bacterial growth in media containing isobutanol from 0.0217 to 0.650mM. In the future, we plan on cloning AdhE, AceE, AceF, YiaY, and GlmZ: genes associated with alcoholic resistance.

We believe that sterols in the ginsenosides are responsible for their main benefits. Therefore in the past projects we engineered synthetic squalene cyclase for in situ production of ginseno-sterols in human cells; and produced synthetic β-glucosidase in E.coli for removal of sugar from ginsenosides. In the current strategy, in the wake of “No release” policy of iGEM community, we are able to by-pass synthetic biology methods to achieve our goal by applying in vitro chemical reactions.
https://teams.igem.org/2538	Therapeutics	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that leads to a progressive muscle wasting and paralysis due to damage in motor neurons. However, no efficient treatment exists. The BGU-IGEM team aims to develop a system that will ultimately prolong survival of ALS patients by targeting microglia and reactive astrocytes, which are both non-neuronal cells that directly contribute to motor neuronal damage. Our approach is based on: (1) inhibition of toxic pro-inflammatory cytokines secretion in microglia cells and (2) on promoting intrinsic apoptotic signal in reactive astrocytes and preventing their toxic effect on motor neurons. Using modified genome editing technique, we build a system that specifically target toxic astrocytes and prevent the formation of new ones which hopefully will slow down the progression of the disease. As the reactivity of microglia and astrocytes is a common in neurodegenerative diseases, our novel approach could be expanded to other neurodegenerative diseases.
https://teams.igem.org/2539	High School	Turning red after consuming alcohol may seem like a mere social inconvenience. Yet, this flushing response is caused by an accumulation of acetaldehyde, a carcinogenic intermediate of alcohol metabolism. Acetaldehyde is broken down into harmless acetate by aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2). ALDH2 deficiency, the result of a point mutation in the ALDH2 gene, produces a much less efficient ALDH2 enzyme, leading to an accumulation of acetaldehyde and the subsequent flushing response. While about 8% of the global population is ALDH2 deficient, in our home, Taiwan, approximately 47% of the population carries this genetic mutation--the highest percentage in the world! Studies show that ALDH2 deficiency greatly increases the risk of developing esophageal and head and neck cancer. Thus, our project aims to produce recombinant ALDH2 to decrease levels of acetaldehyde in the upper digestive tract region. We envision delivery of ALDH2 as a purified protein or in consumer-friendly probiotics.
https://teams.igem.org/2540	Foundational Advance	The unique properties of non-model bacteria can expand the applications of synthetic biology. However, currently there are few reliable tools for engineering non-model bacteria. A central obstacle to the development of such tools is the dependence of circuit expression on host machinery. To address this problem, we developed PORTAL, a system which uses T7 transcription and orthogonal ribosomes to insulate the circuit from host processes. We characterized PORTAL in four E. coli strains, Shewanella oneidensis, and Pseudomonas putida, comparing PORTAL-driven and host-driven expression of a reporter. To design orthogonal ribosomes, we created software that analyzes binding energies of 16S rRNA and determines the optimal orthogonality-promoting anti-Shine-Dalgarno mutations. We created a model that simulates the performance of PORTAL and shows that the system is minimally sensitive to metabolic differences. PORTAL presents a tunable “virtual machine” to facilitate insulated synthetic gene circuit expression in non-model bacteria.
https://teams.igem.org/2541	Foundational Advance	Many strategies could be used by bacteria to coordinate temperature-dependent gene expression. A well-known class of biological temperature sensitive element is RNA-based thermosensor, which is thermoregulatory RNA sequence in the 5'-untranslated region of mRNAs. RNA thermosensors could induce equilibrium shift between closed and open conformations of the translation initiation region under temperature variation condition, and lead to mRNA degradation or ribosome accessibility, thereby controlling the efficiency of translation initiation. However, natural RNA-based thermosensors are difficult to be engineered with the narrow sensing temperature range. Therefore, this year based on free-energy method, we designed a series of synthetic RNA-based thermosensors, which can be engineered easily with broader sensing range. Then, we predicted their theoretical sensing temperature, detected the practical threshold by experimenting setting temperature gradient, and built the standard parts collection.

However, living organisms can also provide a superior camouflage for secret messages. The aim of our project is to develop a yeast-based encrypted system to transmit information between two parties. We convert messages into DNA sequences using a designated program or code book and integrate them into yeast genome. To comprehend the message, the receiver needs to successfully pass through multiple levels of encryption, including cracking a promoter lock by a specific small RNA, reuniting dispersed DNA segments separated by introns, retrieving message nucleotides by a specific primer set and decoding DNA sequence into readable sentences by a unique program. Additionally, a build-in suicide system will prevent the engineered yeast from being extensively propagated.

They are caused by pathogens in the blood such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, dengue viruses, HIV, etc. To detect these pathogens in the human bodies is difficult in areas with lacking resources such as healthcare workers and lab equipment. What’s more, patients infected with diseases like HIV may not be willing to let others to know. Therefore, a simple and self diagnostic device would greatly appeal to them. Team Mingdao is working on engineered mosquitoes to become a biosensor and blood drawer. We successfully demonstrated the experiment in the mosquito cells with the synthetic Toll signaling through antimicrobial peptide (AMP) reporter system to response the pathogens. Finally, to make this project to be usable in real life, we designed a portable mosquito cage as the size of a matchbox for use at home even without any professional instruction.

https://teams.igem.org/2546	New Application	Endophyte can live inside the plants and work together with them without causing harm to the host plant. With the large and deep root system of plants, the endophyte can have further impact in soil. A serious case of soil contamination is dioxin pollution after the Vietnam War. Dioxin is a group of toxic compounds that accumulate in the environment and are difficult to break down naturally. Tackle with large area soil dioxin contamination is hard, since the most efficient way to clean up is burning, which is eco-unfriendly and costly. Our project combines phytoremediation and engineered endophyte to clean dioxin-contaminated soil. We engineered an endophyte with membrane transporter, dehalogenase and laccase to intake and break down dioxin, and created biobricks compatible shuttle vector that can express in a well-researched endophyte, Burkholderia phytofirmans. This platform can potentially apply to projects that related to or benefit from plant-microbe interaction.

At present, CO2 capture mostly includes absorption, adsorption and membrane methods, etc., which have problems with high cost, high energy consumption for regeneration and secondary pollution. CO2 capture using carbonic anhydrase has attracted extensive attention due to its high catalytic efficiency and environmentally friendly properties. First, our project successfully expressed wide type carbonic anhydrase in E. coli, however, its industrial application was limited due to poor stability and easy inactivation. Therefore, based on this, molecular simulation technology was used to investigate effect of amino acid residues mutation on the conformation and activity of enzyme, and the mutant carbonic anhydrase with higher thermal stability was obtained. The experimental results showed that the purified mutant carbonic anhydrase exhibited higher stability and activity than wild type carbonic anhydrase, achieving efficient capture of CO2.
https://teams.igem.org/2548	High School	Aeromonas hydrophila is an ubiquitous gram-negative opportunistic pathogen in aquaculture. Every year, it causes a variety of diseases in fish. The symptoms include ulcers, fin rot, and hemorrhagic septicaemia. When A. hydrophila enters fish body, it often colonise in the gastrointestinal tract first. The pathogen's virulence factors secretion systems are controlled by N-acylhomoserine lactone (AHL)-dependent quorum-sensing system based on the ahyRI locus. Since the pathogen has developed resistance to most common antibiotics, our project targets to develop an A. hydrophila killer by engineering the fish probiotics, Escherichia coli MG1655. The killer expresses lactonase to degrade quorum sensing signals from the pathogen in aim of reducing the production of virulence factors. Also, it expresses antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) to inhibit the growth of A. hydrophila directly. We plan to regulate lactonase and AMPs expression by using Prhl promoter, which is induced by the pathogen’s dominant quorum sensing molecule, C4-HSL.

Here we have developed the ENABLE toolbox, a complete set of transmembrane binary logic gates. Each gate consists of 3 layers: Receptor, Amplifier, and Combiner. We first optimized synthetic Notch receptors to enable cells to respond to different signals across the membrane reliably. These signals, individually amplified intracellularly by transcription, are further combined for computing. Our engineered zinc finger-based transcription factors perform binary computation and output designed products. In summary, we have combined spatially different signals in mammalian cells, and revealed new potentials for biological oscillators, tissue engineering, cancer treatments, bio-computing, etc. ENABLE is a toolbox for constructing contact-dependent signaling networks in mammals. The 3-layer design principle underlying ENABLE empowers any future development of transmembrane logic circuits, thus contributes a foundational advance to Synthetic Biology.

Cases are most prevalent in developing countries with a lack of practical diagnostic methods and clean water. Lambert iGEM created a proactive, inexpensive diagnostic kit for V. cholerae detection utilizing frugal hardware devices and toehold switches. These riboregulators activate gene expression in response to predetermined RNA sequences. Engineering E. coli to detect V. cholerae, we targeted ctxB, a non-toxic subunit of a gene specific to all pathogenic V. cholerae. Our Chrome-Q system quantifies aquatic V. cholerae presence utilizing HSV values while the Color-Q app inputs data into our machine learning model, CALM. Utilizing rainfall, conflict, and cholera case/death data, CALM is able to accurately model the Yemeni V. cholerae outbreak, forecasting outbreaks weeks in advance. With this diagnostic kit, Lambert iGEM addresses V. cholerae epidemics by predicting outbreaks, thus providing low-cost sustainable diagnostic tools while enhancing quality prediction.

Clinging to the teeth in thin layers called biofilm, S. mutans digests sucrose and produces acids that can eat into enamel and cause cavities. Specifically, dextran is the main component of the biofilm. We find two enzymes, the first one is named Dextranase" which can hydrolyze the dextran in the biofilm; and the second one is named "FruA" which can decompose the resource that S. mutans uses to produce bioflim. The gene of these two enzymes are cloned into E. coli and Lactobacillus. In our experiment we would use E.coli to produce these two enzymes for relative measurement like enzyme activity. Then for commercial design we would produce leben with our Lactobacillus which can secrete these two enzymes. "

As a result, an accurate method for early diagnosis is in desperate need. Therefore, this year our team comes up with an engineered E.coli used for early, non-invasive detection of colorectal cancer. Due to the combination with ultrasound technique, we name it, ECHO. When our device arrives at the colorectal area after capsule degradation, it stabilizes on cancerated tissue through antigen-peptide binding, meanwhile expressing gas vesicles in vivo, enabling the rapid detection and location of the cancer foci using ultrasound. Besides usage on detection, ECHO also synthesizes azurin used to eliminate cancer cells after being triggered by environmental factors in cancerated area. At last, after ultrasound detection and medicine synthesis, arabinose will be consumed to trigger self-destruction pathway. To sum up, our device introduces an applicable and innovative non-invasive technique in early diagnosis of colorectal cancer.

It could be converted to chitosan, -1, 4- polymer of 2-glucosamine, through deacetylation. Chitosan is significantly soluble and bioactive, widely used in medicine, food industry, and water treatment. However, the current technology that treats chitin with concentrated alkali has led to deficient, unstable chitosan production, and pollution. After learning that Chitin Deacetylase (CDA) could hydrolyze the acetamino group on chitin, we aimed to find out a crystal- chitin-active-enzymes due to the only industrial-available source of chitin. In our research, we chose several CDA and chitinase sequences, synthesized and complemented them with respective domains, and cultivated them in plasmid pET-28a. After inserting plasmids into competent cells and searching for optimal induction condition for expression, we would finally find out maximum viability and model the research for factory production.

Massive mining and extensive using of copper results in serious contamination to environment, and then copper contamination threaten the balance of the whole ecosystem. We design a circuit that can better detect the amount of copper ions than before. We improved a previous Part by placing self-cleaving RNA ribozyme RioJ between the promoter of copA and RBS, and replacing reporter of GFP by sf GFP. PcopA is regulated by Cue R protein. We design a new part that is made up of L-arobinose inducing PBAD, RBS and Cue R coding sequence.

The spread of ARGs has become a global challenge. Eliminating ARGs of microbes (e.g. from fermentation industry or laboratories) can reduce the amount of ARGs in the environment. To this end, we developed a light-controlled genetic engineering machine for degrading ARGs, which is comprised of the following modules: 1) To cleave an ARG, Cas9 was expressed under the control of arabinose promoter and guided by the sgRNA which targets at the ARG. 2) To control the expression of Cas9 through light, the efficiency of the light-controlled part was measured with eGFP as reporter. 3) To reduce leaky transcription of sgRNA, the arabinose-controlled repressor LacI was constructed and evaluated with eGFP. 4) A module for cell lysis was constructed to disrupt cells after eliminating the ARG. Together, we provided a novel strategy for controlling ARGs.

The upstream of this genetic circuit uses synNotch to transduce extracellular signals into cells. The concentration of signals corresponds to different threshold values and the system can respond accordingly under different concentrations.

This design allows us to execute fine control on signal transduction and protein expression, in our test ststem the expression of sfGFP. In order to make our project more presentable, we use this circuit to design a fluorescent bacteriograph that is able to change the picture, like a bacterial neon light.

Here, we take advantage of using genetic engineering and synthetic biology as powerful tools to propose a new strategy for the densification control. We use Acetobacter xylinus which is a model bacterium for producing cellulose. Its cellulose can be used for water conserving both soil and moisture. On the other hand, Microcolus vaginatus is a dry land living cyanobacteria which is an ideal bioreactor for producing bacterial cellulose. We cloned seven key genes that are critically required for bacterial cellulose synthesis from Acetobacter xylinus and expressed them in cyanobacteria. Additionally, we employed computer modeling and prediction to optimized the production of cellulose. Finally, we successfully achieved the cellulose production from the transgenic cyanobacteria and its cultivation on sands. Together, we have developed a new and low-cost method for desertification control.

Cloning cycles with the current standard, Escherichia coli, typically take up to three days. In our project Vibrigens - Accelerating Synbio, we established the tools to turn Vibrio natriegens into the next generation chassis for synthetic biology, ready to be used reliably. By taking advantage of its unbeaten doubling time of 7 minutes, we substantially reduced waiting time and made one-day-cloning a reality. We built and characterized a flexible golden-gate-based part collection, consisting of more than 100 parts, which enables the creation of complex pathways in a short amount of time. Our engineered V. natriegens strains VibriClone and VibriExpress are designed for cloning and protein expression applications, respectively.

https://teams.igem.org/2561	Foundational Advance	As the field of synthetic biology grows, it becomes increasingly necessary to have a reliable cell signaling platform that is more resilient to noise than traditional promoter-controlled systems. This year, we developed a robust new paradigm for cellular signaling based on frequency, rather than amplitude-based signals. Our system is analogous to a band-pass filter in electronics; the bacteria respond only to signals of an intermediate frequency, but not those of low or high frequency. By adding tunable degradation tags to proteins in the system, it is possible to frequency at which the reporter was expressed. Versatile deterministic and stochastic models were developed by our team and used to simulate and predict properties of the system. Creating a more robust paradigm for cellular signaling has several implications for the future of synthetic biology, including advancements in biological data storage and computing, chemical production, and biosensing.
https://teams.igem.org/2562	WIKI	Alpha-1 Antitrypsin deficiency is a common genetic disorder -- the defective gene for which is carried by 1 in 25 people -- which arises from a single base pair mutation in the SERPINA1 gene, resulting in the production of a form of antitrypsin prone to polymerization. The mutated antitrypsin then builds up in liver cells and is unable to inhibit proteases in the lungs, leading to damage in both. Using CRISPR-Cas9 technology, we aimed to fix the error in SERPINA1 so that proper antitrypsin can be produced. We will show proof of concept in E.

We hope to design a liver organ bud using IPS cell technology to deliver function A1AT through collaboration with Dr. Kagimoto of Healios Japan KK.
https://teams.igem.org/2563	High School	Many gram-negative bacteria naturally create compounds called endotoxins, which induce pathological symptoms including septic shock in humans. Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) testing, the gold-standard endotoxin detection test, is used in virtually every area of biomedical product development. The test is derived from horseshoe crab blood, including coagulation Factor C, the primary effector protein. Many horseshoe crabs die each year due to the bleeding process, straining populations and ecosystems along the US Atlantic Coast and in Asia, where it is less sustainable. Moreover, LAL testing is expensive, creating a barrier to biomedical innovation in low-resource settings. For these reasons, our team sought to synthesize a codon-optimized sequence of Factor C and integrate it into Bacillus subtilis (a gram-positive bacterium) using a pAX01 backbone with a xylose inducible promoter. In the future, we hope to design a detection mechanism to signal for the cleavage of Factor C and the presence of endotoxin.
https://teams.igem.org/2564	New Application	How does microbial community perpetuate or perish? Like human society, in nature, microorganisms not only compete but also cooperate with each other for a successful establishment of a microbial community. The major goal of our project is to construct an accessible evolutionary game model using a synthetic microbial population controlled by genetic circuits. Here, we use E. coli to form a microbial population composed of the cooperator" and the "cheater". "Cooperator" which displays β-glucosidase on the cell surface breaks down cellobiose into glucose. This enzymatic activity allows both "cooperator" and "cheater" to share glucose as an energy source (public goods). "Cheater" which expresses GFP is now able to proliferate within microbe population by glucose from cooperator. Based on the combination of mathematical modeling and experiments we are going to find critical parameters for evolutionary games such as harmony snow-drift and prisoner’s dilemma for controlling population dynamics of the microbial community.

In order to build a sustainable energy source for energy on demand we created a system using living organisms. E.coli was engineered to synthesize lactate which will then be used to feed a Shewanella biofilm. Shewanella oneidensis is a bacterium notable for its ability to reduce metal ions, live in environments with or without oxygen and when incorporated into a microbial fuel cell produced voltage. Results of co-culture experiments to test the symbiotic relationship will be presented.

PAHs and Petrogenic PAHs can inflict lasting damage to entire ecosystems. Horizon harnesses the natural ability of microorganisms to degrade PAHs to catabolize them into nontoxic substances. Horizon then reuses the catabolic end products which can be metabolized by bacteria to produce clean energy by coupling the degradation pathways with sequences that upregulate hydrogen synthesis within E.Coli. Horizon also uses synthetic pathways to metabolize long n-chained hydrocarbons to fuel such hydrogen synthesis. These engineered E.Coli systems are then implemented in a bioreactor system optimized for bioremediation and capable of modulating between conditions for degradation and synthesis. To regulate the oil degradation and hydrogen synthesis pathways inexpensively, Horizon characterizes riboswitches and novel synthetic CRISPRi operators under riboswitch regulation. Ultimately, Horizon provides a comprehensive system for oil degradation and clean energy fuel production.

Nicotine plays a critical role in smoking addiction and is well known to be harmful to human beings, because it easily crosses the blood-brain barrier and biological membranes. Meanwhile, with large quantities of tobacco products being produced and consumed, tobacco waste is entering the environment. So we want to find a key nicotine-degrading gene to degrade nicotine effectively in E.coli by synthetic biology. Nicotine oxidoreductase (nicA) from Pseudomonas putida S16 has been obtained by our team and a new expression vector has been constructed with promoter(J23119), ribosome binding site(RBS B0034), nicA ,terminator(B0015) in psb1c3. NICA expressed by E.coli top10 could catalyse and degrade Nicotine effectively from 35-50℃ and pH5 to pH8.
https://teams.igem.org/2568	Manufacturing	Vaccine is one of the most cost-effective public heath solution, with cell-based approach being a promising production strategy. We are devoted to establish a cell line with self-owned intellectual property and feasible for rapid production of a broad spectrum of viruses, with the aim of reducing the cost of cell based virus production in the heath care sector. By constructing two biobricks and enabling three features to our chassis cells, we considerably reduced virus production cost by increasing virus titer per cell and virus-producing cells per fermentor, and broadening cells’ virus sensitivity spectrum. We used computational modeling to explore genes for biobrick construction and cold atmospheric plasma ejecting device to further increase virus titer. We proved the significance of our project through systematically examining the needs of vaccine production companies including our close collaborator DaBeiNong, and disseminated knowledge related to vaccine and synthetic biology to the public.
https://teams.igem.org/2569	Environment	Pseudomonas fluorescence Pf-5 is kind of biocontrol bacteria which can be used in the environmental protection. Compared with E.coli, the developed organisms, the toolkit for Pseudomonas fluorescence seems hasn’t been exploited well. This year, SKLMT-China wants to construct a library of artificial constitutive promoters as a useful tool for the model-based fine-tuning of gene expression in Pseudomonas fluorescence. The strength of different promoters will be characterized by a reporter gene, firefly luciferase. Given that P. fluorescence pf-5 has a poor ability to degrade nicotine in the natural environment, we hope to engineer this bacteria with a nicotine degradation gene cluster (about 30Kb) from P.putida S16 by red/ET recombination technology. In this way, the nicotine degradation pathway in P. fluorescence pf-5 could be improved so it can degrade nicotine more efficiently. Combined with the promoter library, pf-5’s nicotine degradation efficiency can be easily controlled.
https://teams.igem.org/2570	Environment	According to statistics, the microbes we touched each day are about 3 times more than the human cells. The infection with some specific microbes can cause infectious diseases and give unpleasant smell. Bacteria can infect any area of the body and cause different diseases: pneumonia, meningitis, food poisoning, etc. Our project focuses on inhibition of the infectious microbes in a more efficient, environmentally friendly way. Based on the principles of metabolic engineering, we engineered an E.coli strain producing phenyllaclic acid that has broad-spectrum antibacterial effects, and the rose-like aroma compound 2-phenylethanol. We incorporated the common components of temperature and salt control in the synthesis system, which applied phenyllaclic acid and 2-phenylethanol to the natural environments. In addition, we designed the toxic protein mazF as a suicide switch to ensure biosafety. In the future research, we plan to promote the system into various types of fields and solve more environmental problems.
https://teams.igem.org/2571	Village	As energy resources get scarce, bioethanol production from lignocellulosic waste looks like a great alternative in terms of high energy yield and eco-friendliness. Due to their highly complex and rigid structure, lignocellulosic wastes need to be pretreated before they can be fermented. The process causes toxic byproducts such as furfural and 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural that inhibit the ethanol production and growth rate of bacteria, E. coli ethanologenic strain KO11. By integrating GSH and FucO genes into KO11 bacteria, we aim to enhance bioethanol production. Since furfural and HMF act as thiol-reactive electrophiles, cellular glutathione levels get depleted in their presence, leading to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species. Thus, overexpression of GSH increases cellular growth rates and lifespan. On the other hand, the expression of fucO results in the formation of NADH dependent furfural oxidoreductase which degrades furfural into furfuryl alcohol resulting in a higher rate of growth and ethanol fermentation.
https://teams.igem.org/2572	High School	Biosafety has always been a major challenge. Leakage of recombinant DNA to the environment may cause undesirable environmental consequences. Aiming to solve this urgent issue, we constructed three devices: two for industrial fermentors, and one for drug delivery bacteria. The first device for use in fermentors utilized thermal-sensitive and quorum system sensors, PhlF and sRNA as logic gate components, and DNase as actuator, forming a NOR gate; the second used a cold-regulated device and a LuxR-repressed promoter as sensors, forming an AND gate. Both devices will self-induce DNA degradation if recombinant bacteria are accidentally leaked into environment. Moreover, with multiple thermal-sensitive devices and gas vesicles, we could perform noninvasive monitoring of the bacteria, drug release by heating tissue at the nidus, and initiation of DNA degradation by applying a higher temperature.  For human practice, we mainly focused on current biosafety issues, including biohackers, sales of hazardous materials and local laws.
https://teams.igem.org/2573	WIKI	Microorganisms exist in complex and diverse communities. This enables a variety of important interactions including co-metabolism and nutrient cycling. Yet, it can be difficult to culture species together in a laboratory setting. Mixed populations are difficult to maintain primarily due to competition: a difference in growth rates often results in one population outcompeting another. Our team aims to dynamically control E. coli growth by using optogenetics (light-induced gene expression) to regulate the production of MetE, an enzyme essential for bacterial growth. This kind of control could help us overcome a major barrier to maintaining co-cultures: competition between microorganisms. This would open several doors in biotech and research. For instance, metabolic engineering of microbial communities may improve the production of pharmaceuticals, biofuels, and other important materials. Moreover, controllable co-cultures would allow researchers to explore complex interactions between microbes and investigate questions that could not previously be answered due to co-culturing limitations.
https://teams.igem.org/2574	New Application	Nature has provided a remarkable system to insert genes into functional centromeres of grass genomes. Specifically, centromeric retrotransposons (CR) have the unique ability to insert themselves into the centromere by targeting a yet unidentified docking agent. We plan to adapt this system to insert genes of interest into centromeres. Centromeres are advantageous transgene targets because they lack recombination, allowing the stacking of multiple traits. Retrotransposons, or “jumping genes,” self-replicate and package their genome into self-assembling virus-like particles (VLPs), then reinsert (or “jump”) themselves into a new chromosomal location. To measure the stability of VLPs for packaging molecular cargo, we cloned the full-length gene encoding the CR gag protein and successfully generated VLPs in vitro. We also tested the efficiency of different gene constructs in forming VLPs in vitro. Electron microscopy can confirm VLP assembly, however, we plan to develop a convenient fluorescent assay to assess VLP assembly.
https://teams.igem.org/2575	WIKI	The development of inducible expression systems in plants is imperative to the field of synthetic biology. The University of Georgia’s 2018 iGEM team is expanding the iGEM registry’s profile of plant promoters and reporters. Here we report a modified Gal4/UAS system. The Gal4/UAS system is an inducible promoter system native to yeast that utilizes the Gal4 transcription factor to activate genes downstream of a minimal promoter enhanced by an upstream activator sequence (UAS). We have created a 6X UAS repeat combined with a minimal 35S promoter to provide enhanced expression of reporter genes such as GFP, AmilC, and the apoptotic initiator from bell peppers, BS3, in the model organism, Nicotiana Benthamiana. The introduction of these expression systems to the iGEM registry will enable future iGEM teams to produce targeted expression in plants with ease using a binary vector system.
https://teams.igem.org/2576	Environment	Nowadays a great number of commercially produced sunscreens contain chemical compounds with a broad-spectrum ultraviolet coverage, such as oxybenzone and octinoxate, which are extremely toxic to the environment. Every year around 14,000 tons of sunscreen is washed into the oceans and seas, resulting in a dramatic increase of the toxicity level, causing a variety of pathologies to corals. Tatru_TUIT iGEM team will engineer S. cerevisiae to produce yeast extract enriched with biological sunscreen compounds Shinorine and Porphyra-334, both of which belong to Mycosporine-like Amino Acids (MAA). In order to produce MAAs, we will introduce 4 genes from cyanobacteria Nostoc commune KU002 (MysA, MysB, MysC, MysD) or Actinosynnema mirum DSM 43827(amir_4259, amir_4258, amir_4257, amir_4256) into yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our final product, which combines positive properties of both biological sunscreen compounds and yeast extract, could be further used in cosmetic products like creams, lotions, etc.
https://teams.igem.org/2577	Food & Nutrition	Approximately 48 million people contract a foodborne illness in the United States each year. Many of these outbreaks are linked to field crops contaminated with pathogenic bacteria. Inspired by the 2018 romaine lettuce E. coli outbreak in the United States and the work of the 2015 WPI iGEM team, we investigated methods to prevent biofilms of human pathogens on crops. We analyzed the antimicrobial properties of antifreeze proteins, also called ice structuring proteins (ISPs), and curcumin, a component of turmeric. The biofilms were measured by the amount extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs) they produced using crystal violet binding assays. On lettuce leaves, biofilms were quantified by their colony forming units. We also constructed a gene gun, based off the 2016 Cambridge iGEM team's design, to transform lettuce leaves to express antifreeze proteins. In the future, we envision transgenic crops that produce antimicrobial proteins to protect themselves against colonization of human pathogens.
https://teams.igem.org/2578	Village	Heavy metal pollution has been a hot issue among the society, copper is one of the most universal types of pollutant. In aquaponics, accumulation of copper ions is toxic to organisms. In sight of this, we aimed to create a cost-effective device for metal ions removal from water. In this project, metallothioneins, a type of protein capable of binding metal ions, was expressed in E. coli. Copper absorption capacity of the transformed bacteria is tested. From our results, E. coli can absorb copper ions at 10 mg/L and 2 mg/L. The is no significance difference between untransformed and transformed bacteria at 10 mg/L. At 2 mg/L, the transformed bacteria expressing Elsholtzia haichowensis Metallothionein 1 (EhMT1) slightly enhances the copper absorption ability. At last, we tried circulating E. coli inside dialysis tubings, receiving positive results, it is confirmed the idea using bacteria to remove copper ions in water is feasible.

https://teams.igem.org/2580	WIKI	The goal of our team is to develop a sensitive system to specifically kill liver cancer cells via genetic circuits, by using the combination of liver cancer-specific promoters and miRNAs. The expression of Gal4-VP16 fusion protein was under the control of liver cancer cells-specific AFP, hTERT or ZEB1-AS1 promoters. The Gal4-VP16 in turn drives the HSV-thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) expression by binding to nine tandem UAS elements in the promoter. Furthermore, the expression of Gal80, a Gal4 inhibitor, is controlled under a CMV promoter as well as a cluster of miRNA93/miRNA-362-5p/miRNA-221 binding sites at the 3’-end. As miRNA93/miRNA-362-5p/miRNA-221 are liver cancer cells-specific miRNAs, the expression of Gal80 is significantly suppressed in the liver cancer cells compared with normal cells. As a result, the nontoxic ganciclovir is converted by HSV-TK to a cell-killing drug in the liver cancer cells, but not normal cells.
https://teams.igem.org/2581	Village	Prevention of metastasis remains a challenge for modern medicine. Recent experimental evidences indicate that metastasis development correlates directly on dietary long chain fatty acids (LCFA) intake, such as palmitic acid (PA). Hence, targeting fatty acid availability in the intestine could prevent cancer cells from spreading. Here a safe, effective and affordable solution is proposed by the design of a probiotic with increased LCFA uptake, GARGANTUA. We approached this by modulating the beta-oxidation family genes in E. coli. Moreover, we developed the first LCFA intracellular biosensor that does not interfere with its metabolism. This will provide a tool able to characterize LCFA uptake. We also developed a framework for the genomic integration of the uptake machinery, as a way to increase safety and robustness of our device. GARGANTUA provides a proof of concept for an alternative approach for metastasis prevention with potential applications in metabolic disease treatment.

However, while cold-flu differentiation remains difficult for non-experts, subtyping for epidemic control and treatment scheming is inaccessible for small clinics. In our project, we have constructed a sequence-specific RNA probe that increases its fluorescence by 10-fold upon target recognition. It is proven in a cell-free context and has the potential to expand to cellular applications. We also developed a mobile phone-based fluorometer coupled with its external software, collectively called Tracer. (The combination of hardware calibration and machine learning analysis may provide signal measurement with orthogonality and accuracy.) The tools can be combined into a user-friendly kit, allowing quick determination of their infection status using their nasal fluid, while the data obtained from a population of software users can be gathered for epidemic monitoring. This project provides a novel, rapid RNA-based influenza diagnostic system.

So, we engineered the pheromone pathway in yeast to test histamine release in blood sample under one specific allergen per time. The pheromone receptor ste2 in original pathway is replaced by human Histamine receptor H3 or H4. In order to reinforce the coupling between H3/H4 and yeast G-protein, C-terminal of α subunit of G-protein is modified by replacing several amino acids from the homologous protein in human. EGFP is set behind promoter Fus1 as the reporter gene. Many previous works support our modifications. Then the models of histamine and EGFP intensity relationship and the diagnosis credence can help to give the final result. Our special-designed integrated box can finish the blood collection, reaction and data sending process. Then the result will be calculated by our server and sent back to the smart phone. Thus, our project is available in families.

Heavy metal pollution has the characteristics of being enriched by the biological chain.Traditional treatment methods such as chemical reagent sedimentation mostly bring about great environment pollution and potential safety hazard. We aim at treating this pollution with yeast in an environmentally friendly, economical and effective manner. We found that gene PCS1 extracted from Arabidopsis thaliana can synthesize phytochelatins to chelate heavy metal ion. we use the genetic engineering techniques to take the pcs1 gene from Arabidopsis thaliana and then transfer it into the pPIC9K plasmid. The final step of the process is to transfer this plasmid into the yeast’s cell and activate the gene expression of psc1.

Glyphosate is the prominent example for a total-herbicide, as its usage rate is ever increasing since its introduction in 1974, making it the most-used herbicide in the USA today. Glyphosate has a bad reputation as it is thought to be harmful to human health. We want to improve the knowledge of the influence of glyphosate on the physiology of a model organism. For this purpose, we aim to engineer the Gram-positive model bacterium Bacillus subtilis for the detection and degradation of glyphosate. So far, we have isolated B. subtilis variants tolerating high amounts of glyphosate. Currently, these strains are used to develop and characterize a glyphosate detection system, which is based on fluorescently labeled bacteria. We also plan to engineer the bacteria for glyphosate inactivation using the glyphosate N-acetyl-transferase.

Indeed we created a modularly built toolbox using not only three different dependencies but also three different organisms: With Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Synechococcus elongatus our team engineered a system based on nutrient exchange. Here phosphate is provided through oxidation of phosphite, nitrogen source produced by melamine breakdown, whilst carbon source is provided by Synechococcus elongatus. Two additional independent approaches are designed, too. The first includes regulation via cross-feeding by amino acid auxotrophies and production: lysine by Escherichia coli and leucine by Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The other utilizes regulated self-lysis via quorum sensing molecules, to control cell density by a phage lysis gene. This engineered toolbox opens a wide range of possibilities to create microbial communities for different purposes, such as synthetic probiotics.
https://teams.igem.org/2588	WIKI	Malaria is one of the deadliest diseases worldwide. Extraordinary efforts are made to reduce malaria infections with limited success. All currently available applications, which look to prevent transmission by mosquitoes, are limited by the vast infrastructural differences in affected regions. With the Sustainable Human-Imitating Elimination and Lure Device (S.H.I.E.L.D.) we developed a mosquito trap tailored especially to the requirements of infrastructurally and economically disadvantaged regions. S.H.I.E.L.D. employs a self-sustaining co-culture of cyanobacteria and engineered E. coli which produce a complex mosquito attractant mixture as well as a targeted bioinsecticide. Careful implementation of novel regulatory circuits limiting cell growth, responding to nutrient availability, and monitoring metabolic load allows sustained in-trap production of attractants and insecticide over extended periods of time. The durable trap case with nano filter, co-culture separation and hydrogel reservoir ensures biosafety and brings together our no-maintenance sustainable solution to one of world’s biggest problems.

Water contamination and a lack of water security affects millions of people worldwide every year, especially in at risk communities, resulting in illness and transmission of deadly parasites. Unfortunately, ensuring water safety is expensive and time consuming with few testing options available. The WLC-Milwaukee iGEM team has been continuing past work to develop a simple, accurate, and fast test kit for <i> E. coli</i> providing consumers the tools they need to ensure water safety. We have been working with proteins from Lambda phage known to bind the outer membrane protein, LamB, of <i> E. coli</i> conjugated to HRP. This protein-enzyme conjugate binds <i> E.coli</i> and when a colorimetric substrate is used, an easy to read visual signal indicates the presence of <i> E. coli</i> and fecal coliform contamination.

Such fungal infections significantly reduce sustainability and food production in developing countries, where mycotoxin exposure from lack of advanced food storage are responsible for severe economic losses and 40% of diseases. Our team developed a modified enzyme chitinase capable of breaking down chitin cell walls. Specifically, Serratia Marcescens Chitinase works against multiple families of fungi. By GSTChiA Chitinase genes with a signal sequence from araC, we successfully generated an Escherichia coli line that secretes chitinase against Rhizoctoniasolani Solani, Alternaria raphani, and many other pathogenic fungi. Expression of GSTChiA was further quantified through analysis of chitin compounds. This project will provide an easily accessible method capable of combating major pathogens, saving crop yield and revenue.

Cell-Cell Interactions form a complicated signaling network which is far beyond our imagination. SUSTech 2018 Team developed a time-saving machine" to study cell signaling networks based on genetically engineered Two-Cell system a Secreting and Responding cell. Wnt signaling pathway was our proof-of-principle. Secreting cells secret Wnt signal and were modified by CRISPR-Cas9 knockout system for genetic screening on Wnt secretion. Responding cells were constructed by inserting a strong TCF promoter with GFP fluorescence for visualization of Wnt signal level. Two types of cells were then encapsulated by our microfluidic system producing thousands of Two-Cell droplets at a time. Unlike traditional coculture method this is time-saving.

Multiple DNA nanostructures with aptamers and strand-displacement toeholds were designed for breast cancer therapy. We characterized their actions in vitro and evaluated their therapeutic effects on human breast cancer cell line. To synthesize these DNA nanostructures, a reverse transcription system consisting of three plasmids was designed to operate inside E. coli. By demonstrating a simple and scalable biological production method of functional DNA nanostructures, we made a foundational advance in synthetic biology.

However, there is no report that tissue cells or microorganisms can directly produce low molecular weight HA . In order to prepare low molecular weight HA , physical and chemical methods are needed. However, there are many drawbacks in physical and chemical methods, such as poor product stability, low efficiency, complex reaction conditions and possible environmental pollution. This year our project constructed a recombinant strain Bacillus subtilis 168E which could directly produce different molecular weight HA products by regulating the activities of LHAase. The HasA gene and identified precursor genes was transferred into Bacillus subtilis. Since HA of high molecular weight was produced at this time, we transferred the LHAase gene into Bacillus subtilis 168 which is from leech resources coding hyaluronidase. Therefore the HA could be enzymatic hydrolyzed to different molecular weight.

Biodiesel storage tanks are susceptible to water infiltration that often results in biofilm formation containing bacteria and fungi. Biofilms may clog pipes, degrade fuel, or corrode storage tanks. We set out to engineer a “seek, aim, and destroy” system for the remediation of microbial biofilms. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, commonly found in fuel biofilms, releases the quorum sensing molecule C4-HSL. Our engineered E. coli cells express CheZ protein in response to a concentration gradient of C4-HSL to activate the flagella motors and propel the cells towards the biofilm. In addition, the engineered E. coli expresses chitinase on its surface and secretes cinnamaldehyde. Chitinase breaks down chitin in the fungal cell walls, increasing the ability of cinnamaldehyde to destroy the fungi. Cinnamaldehyde also eliminates bacteria, thus remediating the biofilm.

https://teams.igem.org/2595	Foundational Advance	Antibiotic resistance is a major concern worldwide, estimated to cause 1 death every 4 minutes. Antibiotics for fatal infections such as tuberculosis and pneumonia have become less effective due to bacterial resistance to drug-based treatments. This phenomenon has led pharmaceutical companies to develop new antibiotics to try overcome this problem. However, this is costly and contributes to the emergence of multi-resistant bacterial strains. Throughout the years bacteria have developed mechanisms to resist antibiotics such as DNA mutagenesis, cell wall modification and other; most involve various bacterial proteins that have been modified or repurposed to protect bacteria. It has been shown that down-regulating these proteins’ expression helps maximise the effects of antibiotics. Therefore, our team aim to engineer a library of sRNAs, providing a platform for new tools to regulate gene expression. Our approach therefore synergises with current antibiotic treatment regimes, creating an innovative therapeutic tool.
https://teams.igem.org/2596	WIKI	In 2017, humans released ~32.5 gigatons of CO2 into the atmosphere. Even if anthropogenic carbon emissions ended today, the CO2 in our atmosphere would persist for thousands of years, causing ocean acidification and global warming. Current carbon sink technology is not economically feasible and would cost trillions of dollars at modest estimates. We believe the solution lies in cyanobacteria - photosynthetic prokaryotes - as they were the first organisms to sink carbon dioxide billions of years ago and are some of the most efficient autotrophs. Our approach is to induce sucrose secretion for the industrial production of biofuels and bioplastics, while simultaneously sinking CO2. Additionally, to address the lack of promoters available for cyanobacteria synthetic biology research, our team developed a variety of constitutive, light-inducible, and nutrient-repressible promoter BioBricks for our strain of Synechococcus elongatus. We hope these promoters will be used to produce other high value carbon sinking products.
https://teams.igem.org/2597	High School	Telomerase is silent in most normal somatic cells while active in over 90% of cancers. Therefore, various telomerase activity inhibitors have been developed to treat cancers but all failed. In our project, we acted oppositely to develop a cancer gene therapy by utilizing the telomerase activity in cancer cells. We constructed a telomerase-activating gene expression system to induce cancer cell death. In this system, a vector ended with a telomerase-recognizable end can be elongated by telomerase, which will provide a telomeric repeat sequence that can be bound by a telomeric DNA-targeting dCas9-VP64-sgRNA. This binding will activate expression of an effector gene Cas9. The produced Cas9 protein can then be targeted to the telomeres of cancer cell chromosomes by a telomere-targeting sgRNA, which will produce the DNA damage and lead to cancer cell death. However, due to no telomerase activity, this system will not affect normal cells.

By changing the output into scent genes, our roses can even emit various sorts of pleasant odors.

https://teams.igem.org/2599	Environment	Soil bacteria distribution is skewed by chemical fertilizers. These elements temporarily increase nutrients; however, they promote excessive growth of certain bacteria, such as phosphate solubilizing bacteria, damaging soil integrity. We developed a regulation system to manipulate soil microbiota, using bacteriocins as bio-stimulants to maintain nutrient levels while balancing bacterial ratios. First, we determine ideal levels of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium for plant growth. After determining a volume of fertilizer, we use a nutrient-to-microbiota model that relates element levels to bacteria amounts to determine the distribution of bacteria after fertilization. We use our bacteriocin-effect-model to predict an ideal bacteriocin volume. A correlation model relates inhibition to changes in bacterial ratios. This system predicts the bacteriocin volume needed to prevent bacteria that thrive off chemical fertilizers from becoming too dominant. Our innovative system of regulating microbiotas using bio-stimulants is a long-term solution, balancing high productivity with environmental sustainability.

In order to orchestrate various cellular regulation using a single platform and to make the response dynamics more flexible, we put forward the idea to construct a ‘synthetic membrane-less organelle’ as a multifunctional toolbox in yeast. In this case, certain components are self-organized to form liquid droplets through phase separation, which require multivalence and interaction as prerequisites. Based on this principle, we fused interactional modules into homo-oligometric tags (HOTags) to form droplets in the yeast. Various interactional modules provide diverse control methods while different promoters alter the features and kinetics of our systems. Beyond quantitative analysis of the foundational system, we verified the feasibility of several potential functions theoretically and experimentally, including reaction crucible, sequestration, organization hub, sensor, etc. In the future, by replacing functional modules with other parts, this system would conduct functions not included in the current project.

However, recent studies have indicated that the success is largely dependent on the choice of associated expression system. While there are many ways of regulating VHb levels, there is to this end no simple nor standardized way of tuning the expression levels for a certain application. We present a set of inserts containing VHb expressed at various levels, created by utilizing the library of constitutive Anderson promoters. The effect on the cell growth was investigated by optical density measurements. The increase in recombinant protein yield was determined by co-expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) and measuring fluorescence intensity by flow cytometry. Preliminary data suggest a positive correlation between VHb expression level and GFP fluorescence intensity. Further studies include expression under varying oxygen availability and expression of other target proteins.

These compounds, also known as estrogens, are highly toxic to fish and may cause long-term harmful effects in humans and other animals.The lack of effective treatment of effluents to remove these micro pollutants has led to the contamination of water reservoirs and pollution of the environment. Our team's proposal was the development of a method for the removal of these estrogens from water. To achieve this goal, we cloned and expressed genetically engineered laccases from filamentous fungi in E. coli strains. Laccases are copper-containing enzymes that act in the oxidation of a various range of phenolic substrates, including EDCs. We plan to explore laccases as model environmental friendly biocatalyzers applied in the biodegradation of estrogenic compounds in water and effluent treatment stations, which can greatly improve water quality.

This CooA receptor can bind with the carbon monoxide derived from the polluted environment. The binding of the CooA receptor with carbon monoxide results in a change of the protein structure. Due to the changed structure, the CooA protein will be able to bind to a CooA sensitive promoter on the bacterial DNA. The binding of the CooA receptor with the promoter enables the synthesis of the enzyme urease. Accordingly, the formed urease converts the urea which is present in the medium into CO2. The released CO2 gas in the medium will be collected. When a certain threshold is reached in the amount of produced gas an increase in the resistance between two electrodes will occur. Finally, the detected change in resistance will activate the alarm.

Extending the integration strategy, the team tested chromatin-modifying elements to reduce variability in therapeutic gene regulation, built a droplet microfluidic device for a scalable gene transfer system, and developed a search tool to help iGEMers find past teams' software. As an extensible platform, the strategy promises greater reproducibility for transgenic research and industrial applications.

Next, comparative transcriptomics analysis was performed on mutant and parent strain to investigate the response mechanisms of microbial cells during acid stress. Based on the proposed acid tolerance mechanisms, one new anti-acid component—msmK was discovered. Also, an anti-cold gene cspD2 was selected. The constructed recombinant strain L.lactis NZ3900/pNZ 8149-MsmK-CspD2 shows a significant survival advantage compared with L.NZ3900/pNZ 8149, which means our product exhibited enhanced acid and cold tolerance. This study provides valuable insight into the development of robust industrial strains.
https://teams.igem.org/2607	Diagnostics	Diphtheria is an infection caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae, marked by pseudomembrane in posterior pharynx, potentially leading to respiratory tract occlusion and death. Recently, there has been diphtheria outbreak affecting major provinces in Indonesia. We realize the urgency of fast, reliable, and cheap early detection method for diphtheria infection to overcome this issue. Therefore, we plan to combine Escherichia coli Tar chemotaxis receptor with human heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) receptor so the bacteria can detect diphtheria toxin. In addition, we will combine CheA and CheY in E. coli chemotaxis pathway with LuxAB and eYFP, respectively. When in contact, LuxAB and eYFP will create resonance energy transfer system. Without diphtheria toxin, CheA will interact with CheY and thus LuxAB-eYFP energy resonance will happen, resulting in yellow color. With toxin presence, CheA will not interact with CheY and energy resonance will not happen, resulting in blue color (i.e. LuxAB native color).
https://teams.igem.org/2608	High School	We aim to develop a biosensor for detecting HCV by the nucleic acid aptamer, and the specific detection of trace HCV could be realized by rolling circle amplification, which has great significance to shorten the window period of HCV in clinic transfusion. HCV C gene was expressed, and collected secreted HCV C protein was used to bind specifically with the nucleic acid aptamer. Using the competing reaction of the target antigen, a highly sensitive fluorescent aptamer sensor was developed based on the rolling circle replication. When there is no target antigen, the aptamer complementary sequence binds with aptamer instead of the padlock probe; whereas when the aptamer probe binds with the target antigen, the complementary sequence hybridizes with padlock probe, which triggers rolling circle amplification reaction. Under the action of DNA ligase, the padlock probe is further cyclized and a rolling circle amplification occurs under the action of DNA polymerase.
https://teams.igem.org/2609	Therapeutics	Bacteriophages have long been proclaimed as the answer to antibiotic resistant bacterial infections. However, simultaneous resistance to phages and antibiotics is a concerning possibility. Anticipating this problem, we have developed an in-silico protein modification algorithm that hard-codes mutual exclusion of antibiotic and phage resistance. An engineered phage with high affinity for phosphoethanolamine, the molecule that confers colistin resistance, has been developed as a proof-of-concept. This system has potential applications in drug delivery, ligand extraction and study of bacterial membrane proteins. We are also building a phage mediated immune recruitment system that ensures removal of the pathogen without significant toxin release - a fatal condition in immuno-compromised individuals. This is accomplished by a monocyte chemokine encoded into a lysis deficient phage genome that recruits phagocytic immune cells to the site of infection. PhageShift thus takes a leap forward in addressing potential problems with phage therapeutics before they arise.
https://teams.igem.org/2610	Therapeutics	The number of drug-resistant pathogenic bacteria is rising at an alarming rate, while no new classes of antibiotics have been discovered in the past three decades. We tackle this twofold problem using an innovative open-source screening platform and an extensive societal outreach program aimed at spreading awareness of antimicrobial resistance. Current drug discovery efforts suffer from tunnel vision: screening is limited to lethal compounds. Our project aims to enable rapid discovery of compounds that stress bacterial cells, which can be used to establish novel synergistic combination therapies. Such combination therapies have proven to reduce resistance development in HIV and cancer treatments. In our project, we created an E. coli reporter strain that produces fluorescent proteins in response to distinct classes of cellular stress, by utilising promoters which become activated under specific stressful conditions. This specificity allows for determination of the mechanism of action and for establishment of synergistic combination therapies.
https://teams.igem.org/2611	Foundational Advance	Inspired by the modularization, call-and-return and do-not-reinvent-the-wheel philosophy in computer programming, we came up with the idea of using the dCas9 to manipulate the expression of proteins and to implement complex logic in E. coli. Ideally, we would like to generate a versatile “Library strain” containing the CDS of commonly used proteins. Individuals would simply transform a much smaller “Minimid” which contains specific sgRNAs targeting the sequence of desired proteins into the Library strain, then the dCas9-sgRNA complex can control the expression. To show the practicality of the design, we tested the system in E. coli by using a series of simple logic circuits based on dCas9-sgRNA complex, with fluorescent proteins as reporters. We also thought about the further application of our design in the synthesis of indigo and try to modularize two enzymes that participated. This project will contribute to the construction of engineered bacteria and green manufacturing.
https://teams.igem.org/2612	Village	This year’s project has focused on the production of protein biosensors for detection, diagnosis, and monitoring of salivary hormones. We have taken two approaches to our design process. Firstly, we constructed a reagent-less, and continuous glucocorticoid sensor which utilizes changes in Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer to detect hormones. Secondly, we have begun developing a novel, and easy to use biosensor which utilizes ligand-dependent intein splicing to produce a luminescent signal. The resulting signal could then be quantified, providing a dose-dependent measurement of analytes. In addition to our laboratory work, we have constructed a complimentary diagnostic pacifier featuring a built in luminometer, allowing for the potential to passively collect, and analyze saliva in a portable and non-invasive fashion. In practice, a child would use the pacifier as normal, and the baby’s salivary hormones would be collected, analyzed, and wirelessly transmitted to the parent or a healthcare professional through a smartphone application.
https://teams.igem.org/2613	Food & Nutrition	Listeria monocytogenes is a Gram-positive, rod-shaped, food-borne bacterium, capable of causing the rare, but potentially fatal, disease listeriosis. L. monocytogenes can replicate at temperatures as low as 0°C, allowing it to survive in industrial and domestic refrigerators. L. monocytogenes is often found in soft cheeses, making many varieties of cheese unavailable to those who are immunosuppressed. Man-Cheester aims to introduce the agr quorum sensing system from L. monocytogenes into bacteria used in the cheese making process. On detection of AIP, a key quorum sensing molecule of L. monocytogenes, a colour change will occur, causing the cheese to turn purple and alerting the consumer to its contamination. Our concept could be further developed to include other sources of L. monocytogenes contamination, such as meats, vegetables or kitchen surfaces, to prevent as many cases of listeriosis as possible.
https://teams.igem.org/2614	Village	Malaria affects 200 million people every year as reported by the WHO. This disease is caused by different Plasmodium species, leading to different types of malaria. Therefore a successful therapy for malaria requires rapid identification of the species affecting the patient. We engineered Test Tonic, a qPCR-based diagnostic device, capable for detecting Plasmodium DNA. Test Tonic can not only detect Plasmodium in general but also uses our specifically engineered and optimized primer/probe pairs for the identification of individual Plasmodium species. As a low resource alternative to qPCR we investigate Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA) for our Malaria diagnosis system. Providing isothermal DNA amplification, RPA avoids the need of an expensive thermocycler. These benefits of a quick, economically priced, easy to use and portable malaria test make Test Tonic suitable for the application in traveling situations and in areas without proper infrastructure and energy supply.
https://teams.igem.org/2615	WIKI	This year, we design a toolkit focused on post-transcriptional regulation, which is composed of a RNA endoribonuclease (Csy4) and a RNA module named miniToe. Csy4 (Csy6f), a member of CRISPR family, recognizes a specific 22nt hairpin. The RNA module was constructed by inserting the 22nt Csy4 recognition site between a RBS and cis-repressive RNA element, which can be specifically cleaved upon Csy4 expression, so the RBS is usually masked. Cleaved at the specific recognition site, it can release the masked RBS, thus endowing the programming of gene expression in the translation level with higher feasibility. We want to use one system to achieve diverse expression of target gene. So we further design four Csy4 mutants and five miniToe mutants. The whole system including five Csy4s and six miniToes is called miniToe family. By combining each Csy4 and hairpin, we can achieve different expression level of the target proteins in a polycistron.
https://teams.igem.org/2616	New Application	In the future, a long due consideration and an easier access to healthcare will be given to people with disabilities. Presently, some prostheses allow amputees to perform simple actions but without a direct connection between the nerves and the prosthesis. Furthermore, a major health risk is the development of pathogenic communities of microorganisms in structures called biofilms. Strong treatments with antibiotics, or even surgical reinterventions are then required. They represent a heavy burden for both the patient and the healthcare system. We imagined NeuronArch as a novel application that subverts potential pathogenic biofilms using an engineered one. This interface produces substances called neurotrophins (NGF), for directed and controlled growth of nerves. Using a conductive membrane, it will also allow passing of information and enhancement of the electrical properties. Altogether, these improvements would enable patients to regain natural perceptions and prevent the formation of Staphylococcus aureus biofilms by blocking quorum sensing.
https://teams.igem.org/2617	Energy	With the development of agriculture, the yield of straw is huge, and it grows rapidly around the world every year. However, due to the complex structure of straw, current physical and chemical methods not only consume a lot of energy, but also create potential air pollution problems, while existing biological methods still require pretreatment by chemicals. Therefore, how to use straw effectively has become a problem we need to consider. Fortunately, we have found a bifunctional enzyme, xyn10D-fae1A from a paper, which directly decomposes straw and converts it into useful chemical raw materials – cellulose, lignin, ferulic acid and xylose. In addition, considering the energy shortage, we also convert cellulose to butanol and hydrogen to make more efficient use of cellulose.
https://teams.igem.org/2618	High School	The situation of SCA was described by Professor Edwin Chan during interviews. The difficulties encountered by patients from different stages of SCA were shared in a workshop with Hong Kong Spinocerebellar Ataxia Association. The SCA3 relates to either up or down regulation of four miRNAs biomarkers. A new approach for the diagnosis of SCA3 will be developed under this study. Under the mentorship of the University of Hong Kong, a DNA tweezer nanomachine is employed to detect target SCA3 biomarkers. When the desired miRNA hybridized to the recognition site on the tweezers, the nanomachine is turned from an open state to a closed state, which allows the assembly of the split strand G-quadruplex. The G-quadruplex acts as an aptamer and binds to hemin. The hemin-mediated peroxidase activity produces a color change as a signal. This alternative diagnostic method would have further implication on monitoring the onset and progress of SCA3.
https://teams.igem.org/2619	Therapeutics	In recent decades, scientists have advanced various drug delivery modalities to overcome the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which excludes most neurotherapeutics from entering the central nervous system (CNS), in order to treat CNS disorders. The emerging brain virotherapy using AAV vectors was reported to be immunogenic and costly in manufacturing. In addition, it is rather perilous that therapeutic viruses have to be administered into cerebrospinal fluid. Hence, this year, our team aims to engineer HEK293T cells to produce engineered exosomes, which are extracellular vesicles naturally capable of traversing BBB, hereby providing a low-risk platform for CNS mRNA therapy . The engineering includes: 1. boosting the production of exosomes; 2. facilitating therapeutic RNA to be packaged into exosomes; 3. increasing targeting specificity to neurons with low leakage during the transport of RNA cargo 4. prolonging the expression of therapeutic RNAs in the neurons

https://teams.igem.org/2621	Foundational Advance	Biological part characterization is the core requirement for engineering complex, yet predictable biosystems. The immense complexity of nature makes this a challenging task. Currently, there is a considerable lack of well-defined, standardized parts and an insufficient grasp of their sequence-function relationship. Notably, state of the art screening methods have insufficient throughput to effectively navigate the extensive biomolecule sequence space. To address this issue we have developed a novel approach to part characterization based on microfluidics and modified nucleotides: Catalytic Activity Sequencing (CAT-Seq). CAT-Seq enables the simultaneous activity measurements of billions of biomolecule variants in parallel. Unique biomolecules are each synthesized in separate water droplets and their activity is recorded and stored into their individual DNA sequences. This information can then be readily retrieved by next-generation sequencing. CAT-Seq can rapidly assess sequence-function relationships, characterize regulatory parts, their interactions, and provide much-needed data for predictively designing novel biological systems.
https://teams.igem.org/2622	Foundational Advance	Membrane proteins (MPs) are an essential part of major cellular processes and key targets for drug development. Since distinct obstacles, including cell-toxicity and irreversible aggregation in hydrophilic environment impede MP research, we employ microfluidics and bottom-up forward engineering approach to revolutionize it. Octanol-assisted liposome assembly is implemented for synthesis of monodisperse cell-sized liposomes. We encapsulate modified MP assembly machinery alongside cell-free protein synthesis system within liposomes with excellent efficiency. This system serves as overarching framework for effective synthesis, folding, and competent insertion into the membrane of active prone-to-aggregate membrane proteins. We offer a full-synthetic microfactory that, coupled with directed evolution, solves contemporary problems in MP engineering. Additionally, synthetic liposomes enable building artificial logic gates and signaling pathways to study metabolic cascades and protein interaction completely noise-free. Utilizing liposomes as simplified synthetic models of living cells, SynDrop will facilitate scientists to step into fully controlled synthetic era of membrane protein research.
https://teams.igem.org/2623	New Application	This year team XMU-China developed cell-free systems to detect and treat diseases. Protein detection is unique and significant in biology fields, especially for the detection of protein biomarkers which produced by diseased cells. In order to overcome the deficiencies of traditional detection methods, we have developed an Aptamer Based Cell-free Detection system (ABCD system) of protein. The core of the ABCD system is the specific binding of the aptamer and its target protein. After protein detection, we use outer-membrane vesicles (OMVs) to treat the diseased cells. We designed a system that has realized the efficient, customizable production of OMVs, which serves to encapsulate specific siRNA for disease treatment. To guarantee the practicability detection and treatment system, we also improved KaiABC system and TDPs system to regulate the expression rate of OMVs and store fragile chemicals or biological materials.
https://teams.igem.org/2624	New Application	Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), also called malignant hepatoma, is one of the deadliest cancers. Through the introduction of a double-stranded RNA to the targeted messenger RNA (mRNA), RNA interference (RNAi) leads to the specific cleavage of the mRNA and efficient silencing of gene expression. Since RNAi could be used to silence genes involved in the development and progression of carcinomas, it has promising therapeutic potential for their treatment. The gene therapy strategy we propose here: (1) utilize two cancer-specific promoters (one HCC-specific) to open an AND-gated system to target HCC, the selectivity supposed to be extremely high; (2) is dependent on and hence controllable by a low molecular weight compound; (3) has the flexibility to be adapted to target any mRNA and, if there are disease-specific promoters, other diseases.
https://teams.igem.org/2625	Therapeutics	Our project uses Synthetic Biology to treat colorectal cancer. Our envisioned product is a pill containing genetically engineered probiotic yeast. The pill is ingested by the patient and passes through the digestive tract. If the ingested yeast cells encounter cancer cells in the colon, they will selectively attach to them. As more yeast cells accumulate, the secretion of anti-cancer molecules will be triggered. The yeast cells continuously produce gas vesicles which will refract ultrasound waves. This allows detection and monitoring using simple ultrasound imaging technology in an otherwise invisible and inaccessible part of the body. Meanwhile, the anti-cancer molecules specifically target and kill the cancerous cells, treating the patient with highly limited collateral damage.
https://teams.igem.org/2626	Village	While waste plastics are a major environmental concern, polystyrene is one of the least recycled and is amongst the most polluting plastics. We investigated the impact of polystyrene and evaluated chemical methods of reducing its expanded volume using citrus waste chemicals followed by thermal depolymerisation. Methylbenzene (toluene) is metabolised in Pseudomonas putida F1 through the Tod operon, a class of genes which facilitate the transport and metabolism of toluene. Our goal is to use the tod operon to facilitate the biodegradation of styrene monomers. One critical enzyme, the 3-methylcatechol 2,3-dioxygenase (todE) was reported to encounter inactivation by 3-vinylcatechol intermediate of styrene biodegradation thus, our aim is to up-regulate todE in our composite biobricks while computationally modelling it. If successful, these genetic modifications could be applied back to P. putida F1 for more efficient growth on waste styrene on an industrial scale, with the possibility of useful intermediate collection.
https://teams.igem.org/2627	New Application	In engineering Escherichia coli cell factories, conflicts exist between engineered and endogenous pathways for their competition for metabolite precursors. E.g., the production of polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) inevitably consumes Acetyl-CoA in the TCA cycle for cell growth. Given cell mass is a key factor of yield, precise switching from growth phase to production phase is significant. Previous studies utilized chemical inducers which are subject to irreversibility & toxic effects. In this project, we addressed these problems by introducing light in E. coli transcriptional control. A switch redirecting metabolic flux from growth to PHB production was built using a green light responsive CcaS/CcaR two-component system and a Type I-E CRISPR-Cas System. Upon green light illumination, the gene cluster phbCAD is transcribed to initiate PHB synthesis. A crRNA is transcribed simultaneously and binds a deactivated cas3 (mimicking dcas9) to block the expression of gltA, an essential gene in TCA cycle and cell growth.

The University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) iGEM team will create a safe, sustainable, and cheap progesterone-based contraceptive for all women, regardless of location or status. We will engineer the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica (Yali) to synthesize progesterone. Yali naturally produces a progesterone precursor, ergosterol. We will add five genes to the yeast genome to induce steroid hormone production by completing the progesterone biosynthesis pathway. We will insert these genes into Yali via three parallel experiments: Gibson cloning followed by homologous recombination, yeast-mediated cloning in Saccharomyces cerevisiae followed by Cre-lox recombination into Yali, and yeast-mediated cloning followed by Cre-lox into Yali. Following these experiments, we will monitor progesterone production to determine a safe, effective contraceptive dosage. On proper growth media, our self-replicating yeast biofactory will produce progesterone and provide a sustainable source of contraception.
https://teams.igem.org/2629	Diagnostics	Bacteriophages are viruses that kill specifically, and with a relative efficiency, strains from a bacterial species. They are thus a viable alternative to antibiotics that our fully automated device aims to promote. Our project is designed to: identify a pathogenic bacterium; detect if this bacterium presents an antibiotic resistance marker; select the most effective phages for a therapy. As a proof of concept, we targeted Pseudomonas Aeruginosa, a bacterium causing opportunistic lung infections in immunosuppressed patient. We created DNA probes targeting a housekeeping gene and an antibiotic marker of PAO1. In parallel we automated the different processes required for detection with DNA probes: from the DNA extraction after lysis to a fluorescence measurement via a bacterial transformation. Hence, untrained healthcare professionals will eventually be able to take a sample from a patient, run it through our system, wait for a few hours and get information to decide of a therapy.
https://teams.igem.org/2630	Village	Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic bacterial species, often infects major burns and cystic fibrosis. Historically, antibiotics can treat these infections; however, P. aeruginosa quickly grow resistance, increasing colonization in human flora and decreasing treatment efficiency. Alternatively to antibiotics, inhibition of quorum sensing (QS), chemical communication among bacterial colonies, is under speculation. This experiment compares the effects of common antibiotics (gentamicin and tobramycin) to QS inhibitors (salicylic acid and zeaxanthin) on Pseudomonas survival and QS activity. Bacteria transformed with a plasmid that detected LasR, a P. aeruginosa QS indicator, levels and correspondingly produced green fluorescence protein (GFP) would be transformed to P. aeruginosa and grown in the presence of each antibiotic and QS inhibitor over 3 days. Absorbance and fluorescence would then be measured through serial dilution. This experiment explores a promising possibility for the future of antibacterial care efficiency and success in saving the lives of cystic fibrosis and burn patients.
https://teams.igem.org/2631	High School	Our project is inspired by the possible contamination of the carcinogenic aflatoxins (AFTs), in Pu?er, a Chinese traditional fermented tea. We aim to design a genetically engineered yeast system to detect and degrade its widely occurred species AFT-B1. Our system contains three modules-induction, detection and degradation. The induction module was designed based on an iGEM project in 2017 using two fragments of an antibody against AFT-B1. The detection module utilizes enhanced yellow fluorescent protein to indicate the presence of ATF-B1. In the degradation module, four candidate enzymes were incorporated individually and their activities were assessed. Both detection and degradation modules are triggered when AFT-B1 bridges the two antibody fragments. Our design not only provides a parallel detection and degradation in yeast with potential practical value for Pu?er Tea and other agricultural products, but also establishes a convenient screening system for identifying novel AFT-B1-degrading enzymes.
https://teams.igem.org/2632	Therapeutics	Pyroptosis is an inflammatory form of programmed cell death. The morphology of pyroptosis is characterized by cell swelling which causes the release of cytoplasmic contents. Recent studies have demonstrated that the N-terminal domain of GasderminD protein accounts for pyroptosis of the host cell, which may be exploited for tumor suppression. In our project, we redesign Salmonella to act as a delivery vehicle that can target tumor cells and replicate in their cytoplasm. By inducing the bacterial expression of the N-terminal domain of GasderminD, bacteria are led to lysis and release this protein into the cytoplasm of tumor cell and then induce pyroptosis to the tumor cell by making membrane pores. The lysate of cell rupture during pyroptosis destroys the tumor microenvironment and attracts immune cells into tumor bed to kill tumor cells. Our project which aims to induce pyroptosis to tumor cells provides a new approach for cancer therapy.

https://teams.igem.org/2635	Diagnostics	Countless biomarkers exist in our blood flow, which could be applied to diagnose health condition or even potential diseases. Ensuring the accuracy, common ways for soluble biomarkers detection are mostly invasive and not real-time. Hence, we proposed Biowatcher, engineered reporter cells that enable detection and autonomous report of soluble biomarkers in the bloodstream. The sensing parts of the reporter cells are powered by nanobodies, the single-domain antibody that can be engineered to detect different biomarkers. Binding of biomarkers on nanobodies triggers cleavages and releases of transcriptional activators. Activating the expression of lux gene, in turn, induces bioluminescent emission as a readout for devices to detect. This kind of autonomous reporting system can have great varieties of applications by installation on wearable devices, watch for example. With the required software, the wearable devices could noninvasively track the level of biomarkers for real-time diagnosis.
https://teams.igem.org/2636	WIKI	This year IGEM Bordeaux Team would like to find an alternative to an entire segment of the traditional petrobased chemistry by a new green biobased chemistry. Indeed, we would like to focus on the biocatalysis of the hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) in 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). Don’t worry, it is not as complicated as it appears. HMF is a by-product of the lignocellulosic biomass treatment. Its toxicity toward microorganisms leads to big issue for many companies which want to use these microorganisms to produce molecules of interest from lignocellulosic biomass. Our project consists in HMF detoxification by using it as a substrate to produce FDCA through bacteria .FDCA was identify as one of most promising biobased molecules which can replace many polymers such as PET (and other petrobased molecules). We suggest a sustainable alternative, eco-friendly and independent from fossil resource.
https://teams.igem.org/2637	Foundational Advance	Organisms are adapted to the relentless cycles of day and night thanks to circadian clocks which regulate biological activities with ~24-hour rhythms. This year, we reconstruct KaiABC clock system in the bio-rhythm expression of yeast. This will not only perfect the experimental data of the template xenotransplantation, but also provide more reliable materials in regulating and exploring the oscillation. Correlated with the yeast two-hybrid technique, reporter genes help detect the results of our construction. To work as a powerful heterologous regulator, we investigate the regulatory mechanism of the clock through the systematic alteration of chromosome topology. And a novel application we envisioned was that S. cerevisiae can produce different products alternately under the periodic regulation day and night.
https://teams.igem.org/2638	Environment	Copper, silver and gold - metals are essential for our daily life but resources are dwindling. Industrial mining of metals and electronic waste cause pollution of the environment. Therefore, we established new approaches to recover valuable resources through synthetic biology. By enhancing bacterial abilities to scavenge metal ions from the environment we generated nanoparticles. We optimized Escherichia coli to accumulate metal ions as copper and iron by overexpression of dedicated importers and silencing of exporters while reducing the effects of oxidative stress. To gather nanoparticles from various metal ions we engineered the iron storage protein ferritin. Recycled into nanoparticles the metals could be used for various applications as demonstrated by printing electronics. Considering Dual Use aspects we decided to extract metal ions from pit water instead of dissolving electronics directly. Therefore, in close collaboration with leading experts we developed a customized cross-flow bioreactor for the mining industry.

https://teams.igem.org/2640	WIKI	Detection is essential in providing an illustration of the chemical world around us. Currently, fluorescent protein are used as reporters but they require additional analysis with expensive and immobile equipment. We propose to create an alternative detection system kit using recombinant Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG) as a reporter. The goal of our project is to create an easy, cost-effective, and sensitive detection device for use in synthetic biology, it can even be used by other iGEM teams to get an all-or-nothing response indicating the presence of targeted protein using pregnancy test strips. We plan to create a pGEX plasmid containing recombinant HCG preceded by new restriction sites which is where the promoter is inserted, only to be activated in the presence of the protein in question. Then when a pregnancy test strip is inserted in the sample, it will trigger the response based on the activation of the introduced promoter.
https://teams.igem.org/2641	Foundational Advance	The idea of this project is the improvement of biocatalytic properties of enzyme cascades using surface-layer (S-layer) proteins. S-layers are prokaryotic protein membranes which assemble into two-dimensional lattices with different symmetries. As components of a model system, the S-layer proteins SbsB (p1, Geobacillus stearothermophilus), PS2 (p2, Corynebacterium glutamicum) and RsaA (p3, Caulobacter crescentus) were isolated. In solution these S-layer proteins arrange into three-dimensional nanostructures. Cluster formation of S-layer proteins was examined by mixing different symmetries (p1, p2 and p3). Structure formation was predicted with Monte-Carlo Markov chain simulations. To explore novel potential applications, S-layer proteins were conjugated with Streptavidin. Thus, various biotinylated fluorescence markers can be applied for FRET analysis. This can serve as model system for S-layer conjugates with biocatalysts.
https://teams.igem.org/2642	Environment	Environmental pollution is a pressed global issue, even in clean, green New Zealand. Maintaining clean waterways is our responsibility as kaitiaki of the land (guardians in Te Reo Māori), but agricultural practices such as excess fertiliser application and cow effluent are flooding our New Zealand soils and waterways with urea. Taking a fluxomics approach in Arabidopsis thaliana, we are overexpressing a high-affinity urea transporter (DUR3) to upregulate the uptake of urea, and glutamine synthetase (GS1) to convert the toxic metabolite ammonia into glutamine. As a result, urea is removed more readily from the soil before it’s subject to groundwater leaching or surface run-off. We predict the increase in amino acid production will enhance plant growth. Applying our model to other plants like ryegrasses will allow farmers to grow pasture or forage crops that utilize urea on the paddock more efficiently, requiring less financial investment into urea fertilisers.

Gene doping has been on the list of prohibited substances in sports since 2003, yet no method has been implemented to enforce this ban. Our project, Advanced Detection Of Performance Enhancement (ADOPE), aims to provide the proof-of-concept for an efficient, secure and versatile detection method. We have modelled the detection window; implemented a suitable sample preparation method from blood; developed a valid pre-screen based on gold nanoparticle technology and developed a unique and cutting edge targeted sequencing platform based on a novel dxCas9-Transposase fusion protein and nanopore sequencing technology. Finally, we have developed an algorithm that is able to group our sequencing outputs and indicates whether the athlete used gene doping.

https://teams.igem.org/2645	Foundational Advance	With the ever-growing demand for designing proteins with better sensitivity, selectivity, stability, and affinity, oligo-based site-directed mutagenesis has become instrumental and indispensable in Genetic Engineering. The conventional method is considered cumbersome, for it relies on replica-plating to screen the mutants based on the reversal in resistance and sensitivity to two antibiotics: Tetracycline and Ampicillin respectively. It also necessitates sub-cloning the mutated gene in an expression vector to ultimately express the mutant-protein. Our orthogonal system facilitates fluorescence-based screening of mutants, using a novel ‘Red-Green’ Dual-Fluorescent GFP-mutant. While point-mutating the gene-of-interest, introducing a single point-mutation in the coding sequence of this GFP-mutant codes for its ‘Green-Only’ isoform. The loss of red fluorescence in the transformed colonies is indicative of successful mutagenesis. Apart from simplifying the screening method, this system facilitates the mutagenesis of the target-gene and expression of the mutated-gene using a single plasmid, thus eliminating the need for sub-cloning.
https://teams.igem.org/2646	Software	BioMaster is an integrated bio-brick database with the function of promoter prediction. We improved and standardized the information of bio-bricks in iGEM Registry by integrating information in databases like Uniprot, Epd, GO, etc. So BioMaster provides more comprehensive information about bio-bricks, including their functions, sites, interactions and references. With these, bio-bricks could be used and designed in a more reasonable way. Meanwhile, BioMaster offers more user-friendly searching methods. In addition, we provided a promoter prediction tool based on machine learning, in which promoter sequences can be found in unlabeled gene sequences. Via this tool, a promoter database predicted from E. coli genome was constructed, it contains a quantity of promoter sequences and information about the gene to which the sequences belong. We believe that this brand-new bio-brick database, BioMaster, can provide more conveniences for synthetic biologists.
https://teams.igem.org/2647	New Application	Textile dyeing is one of the biggest polluters of natural waters. Many of the synthetic dyes used are non-biodegradable, toxic and large amounts of them end up in waters during the dyeing process. Natural dyes, although less toxic than synthetic ones, require mordants in order to bind to the fabric. Mordants often contain aluminum or other metals, which are harmful to the environment. We are addressing the problem by using two types of colorful fusion proteins. Chromoproteins are fused with binding domains to create colorful proteins which can bind cellulose or keratin based materials, such as cotton or wool, respectively. Spider silk is added to some of the proteins in order to make colored silk proteins that can be made into fibers, which would erase the need for the dyeing step from the textile value chain completely. Our experiments were focused on binding tests and silk fiber production.
https://teams.igem.org/2648	Village	Quantification of nucleic acids is essential for ligation reactions and other reactions that require nucleic acids. Without accurate quantification of nucleic acids, it is difficult to complete a molecular biology experiment. Spectrophotometers are commonly used but are not accessible to all lab groups, making experiments prohibitively difficult for some. The Ethidium Bromide Spot Test protocol is a quick and dirty approach that relies on visualizing dye-DNA complex fluorescence under UV light. However, its reliability is questionable because the protocol is not well characterized. This year, the CUNY Kingsborough iGEM team hopes to better characterize this protocol and standardize the fluorescent measurements using ImageJ™. Ideally, our characterization will allow future iGEM teams to reduce lab costs but still produce trustworthy results. As proof of application, we will use the Ethidium Bromide Spot Test to construct and characterize quorum sensing BioBricks. Additional modelling will be performed to tune the BioBricks’ pattern-forming behaviour.
https://teams.igem.org/2649	Therapeutics	Cariogenesis is facilitated by the growth of dense, adherent biofilm on the surface of teeth. This process is largely initiated by Streptococcus mutans through quorum sensing, a process by which S. mutans release Competence Stimulating Peptide (CSP) to activate a two-component signaling system (ComCDE) in neighboring cells, leading to critical bacterial mass formation on the tooth surface. Here, we engineer mammalian cells to sense CSP and biofilm formation by incorporating the ComCDE system into Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) cells. In turn, our engineered HEK cells process the signal and actuate a response by secretion of kappa casein, a protein with known anti-biofilm activity. We envision these cells being administered through either an oral device worn overnight or as a cell therapy injected into patients’ gums by dental professionals. Ultimately, our system will allow cells in the oral cavity to automatically detect and combat cariogenesis, preventing the onset of dental caries.
https://teams.igem.org/2650	North America	The accumulation of plastic pollution has spurred a global crisis. Looking for a solution, the OLS SynBio team discovered that the issue is not the recycling of plastic, but instead the inefficient sorting of plastics. The project uses synthetic biology to create a novel fusion protein that can specifically bio-tag polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic, so it can be sorted and recycled correctly. The project involves two proteins, PET hydrolase (PETase) and a hydrophobin called BsIA, that are produced via a bacterial chassis called Bacillus subtilis. The PETase enzyme binds to PET and is fused to a red fluorescent protein called mCherry, visually indicating when the adhesion occurs. The hydrophobin is “water-fearing” and will help to bind the PETase to PET plastic. So far, transformations of Bacillus subtilis using the construct have been successful, and real-world applications of the project look promising.
https://teams.igem.org/2651	Village	Every year, 8 million tons of plastic enter the ocean and can devastate the ocean’s ecosystem. Many of these plastics are broken down into very small pieces called microfibers which are more harmful because they can be consumed by many organisms and negatively affect their health. Although the exact path from land to ocean is still unclear, we aim to remove the plastics from the wastewater level where plastic particles are known to accumulate. To eliminate these plastic particles from wastewater, we tested modified PETase enzyme that contains a unique catalytic site. To model our system, we aim to use a zero-energy requiring RAM pump design to hold our microbes and properly circulate the plastics and degrade them so plastic-free water can be released from the treatment plants and into the environment without any harm coming to the aquatic ecosystems.
https://teams.igem.org/2652	Environment	This year's iGEM team decided to continue the work started by last year's team with the Nickel Hunter project; a biological device to detect nickel ions in the environment. Two shortcomings of the previous design were a small measurement range, and low precision. This year we added the nickel ions channel protein NikABCDE gene to the original gene element allowing the ions to enter the cell more smoothly, which has improved both of these issues. We also replaced the RFP gene with the luciferase LuxCDABE gene. The reporter gene emits fluorescence in response to nickel ions which further enhances our measurement precision. It also provided the opportunity to develop a biosensing instrument for real-time nickel ions detection. Our changes improved sensitivity and range, as well as provided an opportunity for a new method of nickel ions detection.
https://teams.igem.org/2653	Foundational Advance	TRIM-AWAY, through introducing antibody and Trim21 protein into cells by microinjection or electroporation, represents a novel strategy which could rapidly remove unmodified native proteins in diverse cell types. However, the high complexity and low efficiency limited its application. Through combining TRIM-AWAY and ectopic expression of recombinant antibodies, we developed PR PREDATOR, a robust tool for degrading endogenous proteins in mammalian cells. Basically, parts for expression of Trim21 and recombinant antibodies were constructed and inserted in one single vector to realize the P2A-mediated bicistronic expression. GFP and ErbB-3, a member of the receptor tyrosine-protein kinases highly involved in the proliferation and metastasis of cancer cells, were chosen as targets of PR PREDATOR for the proof of concept and further demonstration of our design respectively. Our PR PREDATOR method shall provide not only novel tools for protein function study but also brand-new options for treating disease caused by aberrant protein aggregations.

https://teams.igem.org/2655	High School	A great percentage of Earth’s population is allergic to specific substances. Approximately 20 million people living in Germany are allergic to different plants, animals and much more, but about half of them are allergic to pollen. We want to help these people suffering from an allergy to pollen by advising them which dose of medicine is necessary for every day. Although there is already useful medicine, we are convinced that we can optimize the use of such medicine and reduce the exposure to unnecessary drugs which have negative side effects like lowering the personal performance capacity, becoming tired and many others. Therefore we use a DNA-based method using pectinase and cellulase to open the pollen and isolates their DNA. This DNA will be used for a PCR with specific primers against the birch allergen Bet". By hereby identifying pollen we aim to measure the current pollen exposure in the air."
https://teams.igem.org/2656	New Application	Access to Synthetic Biology by the interested layperson is currently hampered by several barriers, including a required background knowledge and availability of expensive and often bulky technological equipment. Printeria, a fully-equipped bioengineering device able to automate the process of printing genetic circuits in bacteria but made as simple and easy to operate as a domestic desktop printer, breaks down these barriers. It uses a digital microfluidic system creating little droplets that can be mixed and moved across predefined electrode paths on a PCB surface. Printeria combines this novel system with Golden Gate Technology, low-cost sensors and electronics, and a user-friendly software application. This way, the user is capable of assembling domesticated DNA parts in a one-step reaction and can control all biotechnological steps, from the assembly of parts and transformation to cell culture, with high accuracy. Printeria opens the door to a world of applications affordable for the general public.
https://teams.igem.org/2657	Foundational Advance	Synthetic biologists often reach for a handful of well characterized organisms when designing experiments due to their ability to be reliably engineered with standard protocols. However, there are many non-model organisms that perform useful functions, survive extreme environments, or are optimized to produce certain materials which are largely ignored because the methods of engineering them are not well established. The broad host range kit aims to use genetic parts that function in a wide range of bacteria to make this process more efficient. The kit contains a combination of plasmid parts and assembled plasmids with origins of replication known to function in diverse bacteria. Each origin is linked to a fluorescent protein or chromoprotein so successful transformations can be easily identified when plated. Additionally, origins are associated with a specific barcode that can be sequenced to confirm the assembly. Several assemblies containing broad host range origins have been constructed.
https://teams.igem.org/2658	New Application	Our proposed project seeks to investigate amyloid-beta aggregopathy in Alzheimer's disease (AD) through an E.coli model system. We will generate a mutant library of the Amyloid Beta 1-42 (Aβ1-42) gene, to be recombinantly expressed in E.coli as part of a drop-out screen. Given that Aβ1-42 spontaneously aggregates into toxic plaques, we expect the dropout cultures to become enriched over time for Aβ1-42 gene variants correlated with a reduced capacity for aggregation. We will use next generation sequencing data from our initial and resulting mutant sequences to develop a model to identify key regions of the Aβ1-42 sequence crucial to plaque formation. This can contribute to future research by revealing plaque-forming Aβ mutations.

https://teams.igem.org/2660	Therapeutics	Treatment of metabolic disorders often relies on pills and uncomfortable injections. Genetically engineered probiotics have the power to revolutionize drug delivery in a non-invasive way, by acting as living therapeutics in the human gut. To take this novel approach to its fullest potential, we designed a robust framework to engineer living therapeutics. Our framework provides an interchangeable and adaptable system to secrete and deliver a therapeutic polypeptide in response to an environmental signal, and a light-responsive biocontainment module based on the CRISPR/Cas9 machinery. Moreover, we designed and constructed a low-cost bioreactor system to simulate the human gut microbiome and validate our engineered probiotic. As proof of concept, we engineered a probiotic to treat type 1 diabetes that secretes insulin in response to glucose. Our framework aims to offer an easy, modular, robust and open-source solution to engineer and validate designer probiotics, bringing new hope to patients suffering from metabolic disorders.
https://teams.igem.org/2661	WIKI	While microfluidics is not new to synthetic biology, they're not widely used by or accessible to many biologists. The current “lab on a chip” microfluidic chips are highly specialized to each experiment and expensive to manufacture. In order to analyze the results of the experiments on microfluidic chips, many designs incorporate embedded sensors directly on chip. However, labs already have dedicated equipment to analyze experiments, such as plate readers and flow cytometers. Traditional analytical equipment could be used to analyze the outputs of microfluidic chips if the outputs were dispensed selectively into standard vessels, such as a 96-well plate. This would increase the design space for microfluidic experiments, enabling biologists to incorporate microfluidic chips into their workflows without having to fabricate highly specialized chips. To accomplish this we have created TERRA, an application-agnostic system that selectively dispenses the outputs from a microfluidic chip into standard vessels for downstream analysis.
https://teams.igem.org/2662	Environment	The emerald ash borer, Agrilus planipennis, is an invasive species native to Asia that first appeared in the United States in 2002. It has since spread to four Canadian provinces and thirty-five U.S. states, including Nebraska. The infestation is currently monitored with detection traps baited with the green leaf volatile (Z)-3-hexenol, which has been documented as an unreliable lure. The more effective bait, Phoebe oil and its most bioactive constituent 7-epi-sesquithujene, are commercially unavailable. Our team seeks to meet this challenge by building a bacterial cell factory to synthesize 7-epi-sesquithujene. We first introduced the mevalonate-dependent pathway into E. coli to enable the accumulation of the key biosynthetic precursor, farnesyl pyrophosphate. The maize terpene synthase gene tps4-B73 was then expressed in the engineered host. Accumulation of the target molecule by the constructed strain was confirmed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. Future research will focus on product quantification and purification.
https://teams.igem.org/2663	Food & Nutrition	Virulent races of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici (Pgt), or wheat stem rust, have caused devastating effects on cereal grains worldwide, impacting global food security. We are engineering Escherichia coli DH5α and Saccharomyces cerevisiae EBY100 to detect Pgt and improve response times to virulent strains. To detect Pgt, we are creating a device that will germinate spores from the Puccinia genus. The germinated spores produce ribitol, a sugar unique to Pgt. Our engineered DH5α will produce a fluorescent signal in the presence of ribitol, thus detecting Pgt. To detect specific virulent races of Pgt, we will modify yeast to contain the stem rust resistance gene Sr35 from Triticum monococcum. Sr35 recognizes its corresponding effector AvrSr35, secreted by Pgt, as part of the plant’s innate immune system. Using bimolecular fluorescence complementation, our yeast will detect AvrSr35, a first step in being able to indicate the virulence of the germinated Pgt spores.
https://teams.igem.org/2664	Village	Recombinant proteins have diverse and important therapeutic and industrial utility, at present their purification is costly, time and labour intensive. Our research simplifies this purification process by sequestering desired proteins into synthetic vesicles, allowing for bulk purification via an operationally simple centrifugation step. These synthetic vesicles have been engineered into the expression host E.Coli. As previously shown in plants and algae, vesicle formation occurs spontaneously in the presence of chlorophyll and the enzymes needed for its biosynthesis. Cells grown in the dark recruit phospholipids to form crystalline aggregates known as prolamellar bodies. Subsequent exposure of the cells to light results in the conversion of these aggregates to vesicles. By mimicking this natural process, our cells can be selectively induced to capture valuable recombinant products in easily isolable vesicles. Additionally, through computational modelling and our human practices ‘customer discovery’ toolkit, we have validated the viability and potential impact of this research.
https://teams.igem.org/2665	Foundational Advance	The conformation, kinetics, and binding of macromolecules are highly sensitive to the ion environment so we must control it to succeed biological research. Thus, there is demand of ionic control tool which supports bio-sensing and bio-remediation for research usage. So we addressed to develop such a biological deionization tool. This year we focused on Na+ which is basic ion in biology, and desalination system can be realized by salvaging Na+ in solution as paste of Saccharomyces cerevisiae by applying two attributes. One is highly Na+ uptake of their plasma membrane and vacuolar by transfer of transporters. The other is surface interaction aggregation system using SdrG-Fgβ protein connection through surface display. In addition, we calculate initial amount of our yeast to adjust to desired concentration by reconstructive membrane transport mathematical model. Furthermore, this tool can be applied to bioremediation and expanded to other ions.
https://teams.igem.org/2666	New Application	Modern hormonal contraceptive methods have been revolutionary for women in developed countries; however, they still exhibit a variety of challenges. Developing countries lack consistent access, hormonal contraceptives can produce harmful environmental effects, and some women are unable use them due to health problems. The Vagineering project looks to solve these issues with a novel, non-hormonal method. Our team aims to engineer Lactobacillus jensenii, a bacterium from the vaginal flora, to produce two proteins to prevent unintentional pregnancy: antisperm antibodies that inhibit sperm motility and anti-microbial peptides (AMPs) that produce spermicidal effects. The goal is to create a lasting contraceptive using only bacteria, which can later be reversed by engineering the strain with a kill-switch. Additionally, our studies of this strain have produced a toolbox that will help other teams to further engineer this less-characterized bacterium.
https://teams.igem.org/2667	Environment	Dioxins, a family of chemical compounds, pose a serious threat to humans, animals, and the environment. Classified as persistent environmental pollutants, these compounds move up the food chain via bioaccumulation; consequently, they are found in very harmful concentrations by the time the reach humans. Our team has set out to engineer a metabolic pathway for the complete degradation of dioxins, and detoxification of chlorinated compounds. The pathway would involve the uptake of these pollutants and their subsequent breakdown into molecules that would enter organisms’ native metabolism. We are testing the pathway in S. cerevisiae, and have prepared expression vectors and means to engineer a multitude of plants. By deploying such pathways directly into endemic plants, our solution can be tailored to specific regions. Furthermore, because we can efficiently control plant reproduction, we can responsibly implement synthetic biology to solve this issue in a non-invasive and ecological manner.
https://teams.igem.org/2668	Manufacturing	Cellulose is broadly used in medicine, textile and stationery. However, functionalising cellulose could lead to exciting innovative material developments such as conductive paper or self-disinfecting bandages. Here, we designed a versatile linker protein to enable the fixation of a wide range of organic and inorganic molecules on cellulose. Since the design is based on the fusion of three fixating protein heads, we named it Cerberus, like the mythological dog. The first head is a protein domain of the type 3 Carbohydrate Binding Module family to bind cellulose. The second is a streptavidin domain, with high affinity for biotinylated compounds. The last head features an unnatural amino acid, azidophenylalanine, allowing click chemistry to form covalent bonds. Each head has been assessed and cellulose with new functions has been produced. This work combines synthetic biology, chemistry and molecular modelling and paves the way to a revolution in our use of cellulose-sourced materials.
https://teams.igem.org/2669	WIKI	This year iGEM Uppsala has applied modern methods in novel ways to solve problems in a field largely untouched by synthetic biology. The purpose of the project is to use applied diagnostics to prevent overutilization of anthelmintics in horses by engineering a ‘smart’ bacterium. These bacteria would be able to report the presence of specific nematode parasites in a quantitative manner, allowing deworming treatments to be individualized for each horse depending on the level of infection. This would minimize the risk of future anthelmintic resistance, helping to stem the impending problem. Using synthetic biology to solve problems in veterinary diagnostics has presented many unique challenges to our team. These challenges have been overcome by development of new applications of existing techniques such as phage display, transcriptome sequencing using nanopore technology, and chromoprotein expression.
https://teams.igem.org/2670	Information Processing	Our goal, communication with eukaryotes, is achieved through the heart piece of our model, the dCas9 Toggle Switch. This will allow switching between two stable states of gene expression. It consists of 2 gene classes which we simply call the ON and OFF genes. One gene in each class, which is considered the primary gene, codes for a gRNA which represses the antagonistic set of genes by binding to dCas9 and further blocking transcription though CRISPR Interference. The switch can be activated either by signal molecules binding to a receptor or directly by liposome bound gRNA that is taken up by the cell. As a proof of concept, the ON gene contains a GFP coding sequence as a reporter gene. Our design is very universal and has many possible applications in the lab and in agriculture, such as controlling flowering time of plants to protect them from late frost.
https://teams.igem.org/2671	Manufacturing	The expression of proteins in bacteria is a way to enable production of biofuels, large scale production in the pharmaceutical industry, and research. However, mass production of certain proteins in bacteria is hindered by protein size or the complex folding structure of proteins. Protein folding has been shown to be assisted by chaperones, a protein aiding the expression of other proteins in bacteria. We illustrate this by co-expression of GroES and proteins that are problematic to express in E-coli. GroES is mostly known as a co-chaperone, but some studies indicate that it has a folding property on its own. We have aimed at investigating this further in order to create a system for expressing proteins in bacteria. We hope that our findings will give insight into sustainable ways for industrial protein production.
https://teams.igem.org/2672	WIKI	Adrenaline is an essential medication used to treat several conditions, including life-threatening anaphylactic reactions. However, the current chemical manufacturing processes struggle to keep up with the demand for adrenaline, often leading to shortages of potentially life-saving medicine. Our project aims to increase the molecule’s availability by providing an eco-innovative alternative with milder operational conditions. We designed a two-plasmid system which harbors synthetic human cDNAs encoding the adrenaline enzymatic pathway. We explored how the insertion of this plasmid system into a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain engineered to overproduce L-tyrosine can be used for the biosynthesis of adrenaline. As the enzymatic pathway also produces metabolic intermediates of biomedical interest, we intend to create three strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae producing dopamine, noradrenaline or adrenaline, based on plasmid combination. Along with an optimized protocol to harvest purified products, we present our exploration of the social and ethical impacts of using this process to mass-produce adrenaline.

Even small amounts of arsenic pose a threat to long-term community health, including cancer and developmental issues in children. The city and state have spent more than $62,000,000 over 18 years testing around 450 yards in the region, with efforts still underway. Our iGEM team seeks to change that paradigm by engineering an affordable and easy-to-use biosensor that utilizes chromoproteins made in the presence of bioavailable arsenic. Our biosensor is user-friendly by design and will not require hazardous chemical reagents. The Tacoma RAINMakers’ goal is to improve community understanding of this local environmental issue and provide a low-cost tool that can be used by the citizens of Tacoma and communities worldwide to detect heavy metals.
https://teams.igem.org/2674	Therapeutics	Biologic based therapies have become a promising field in cancer medicine due to their ability to harness the immune system to attack cancer cells. However, a potential side-effect of these therapies is an overactive immune system which can lead to severe reactions and possibly death. A solution to this overactive autoimmune attack would be to engineer and implement a safety switch into the system. This would allow for more aggressive monoclonal antibody therapies to be used while limiting the hazards of potential severe side-effects of current therapies.
https://teams.igem.org/2675	Foundational Advance	“Communication is Key” is a universal principle that applies to all levels of organization: from microbial colonies to human social networks. Communication helps single-celled organisms to determine their collective fate by quorum sensing, and individual footballers to coordinate the winning goal for their team (Allez les bleus!). However, if the language used to communicate has limited vocabulary, it’s hard to have any meaningful conversation. Synthetic bacterial consortia are currently engineered using a very small set of signalling molecules for cell-to-cell communication, thus limiting the potential of this powerful technology. In our project, PepTalk, we repurpose the small peptide based signalling system of SPbeta group bacteriophages for application in the more widely used laboratory workhorse Escherichia coli by engineering hybrid E. coli promoters in order to demonstrate orthogonal communication channels between cells. The PepTalk system will expand the repertoire of unique bacterial communication signals, enabling more complex conversations in bacterial consortia.

https://teams.igem.org/2677	Food & Nutrition	Escherichia coli 1917 is a clinically approved therapy for various forms of inflammatory bowel disease. In order to apply synthetic biology approaches to potentially augment the probiotic and therapeutic potential of this bacterial strain, we decided to introduce a heterologous butyrate producing pathway into the bacteria. We decided to delete several genome genes involved in producing metabolites that drain carbon and reducing equivalents from theoretical butyrate production in a redox - balanced manner. Then, we synthesized two gblocks in order to assemble them together to form a biobrick encoding 5 enzymes involved in butyrate production. We also tested the function of past iGEM teams that have unsuccessfully attempted to produce butyrate. Our approach to metabolic engineering of E. Coli Nissle 1917 involved both genome editing and biobrick assembly, both of which are necessary to turn this strain into a therapuetic butyrate cell factory in the gut.
https://teams.igem.org/2678	WIKI	Since the year 2002, North American ash trees have been infected with and killed by an invasive beetle species known as Emerald Ash Borers (EAB). Current methods for prevention and treatment of EAB’s are too expensive and time consuming for large scale eradication. Our proposed long term solution is to develop Ash trees that are genetically resistant to EAB’s. From a known Bacillus thuringiensis Cry8Da protein, we hope to induce mutations in the protein’s receptor binding regions to create a Bt toxin specific for EAB’s. After screening modified proteins, we will utilize leaf-specific expression of the Cry Toxin in Arabidopsis thaliana as our model system for Ash trees. This method will target EAB’s as they feed on ash leaves during adulthood. We hope to present this system for future development as a safe and effective alternative to current treatment methods used in affected areas.
https://teams.igem.org/2679	Food & Nutrition	Organophosphate (OP) insecticides, including parathion and malathion, inhibit the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, thereby causing over-accumulation of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. OPs account for 30% of pesticide sales worldwide. Over 200,000 people, mostly farm workers, die each year from over-exposure. The OP malathion is the most common insecticide contaminant of livestock feed in the U.S. Here we show that Escherichia coli that express artificially evolved enzymes protect a model animal, Drosophila melanogaster, from otherwise toxic doses of malathion. This result is significant because the strategy could be extended to protect pollinating insects, livestock and farm workers from malathion. More generally, these results suggest that enzymes that bioremediate toxinscan be applied without purification as long as they are expressed in environmentally benign hosts.
https://teams.igem.org/2680	Village	One of the most ubiquitous forms of information processing in cellular systems is one in which information is encoded in the time-domain dynamics of signals. Although there exist synthetic circuits capable of encoding information in the time-domain of gene expression, the field lacks circuits that can decode time-domain information. As a result, synthetic circuits are incapable of processing time-domain information, rendering them unable to interface effectively with dynamically encoded cellular signals. To address this problem we created a decoder circuit that uses an incoherent feed-forward loop to convert frequency-encoded information into amplitude-encoded information. Through modeling and experimentation we demonstrate that our IFFL decoder allows synthetic circuits to more accurately process information encoded in the frequency of an oscillatory signal. Our decoder therefore provides a means for teams to design and build synthetic circuits that can better interface with endogenous signaling pathways to access the broad possibilities of time-domain information processing.
https://teams.igem.org/2681	Therapeutics	Our proposed project is to create a glutamate biosensor. The proposed biosensor can be used to detect and give a fluorescent readout on the glutamate concentration level. The biosensor will be a circuit in Escherichia coli where fluorescent readout, via FRET, will correlate with the glutamate concentration. The signal will be detected using a calcium based fluorescent system. Our system uses a calcium channel that has a glutamate binding site which opens upon binding in our bacteria. Once the channel opens, the influx of calcium and the binding of calcium to our calmodulin-based fluorescent sensor. The calmodulin undergoes a conformational change into its active form, and will form a protein-protein interaction with M13 peptide, the calmodulin-binding domain of skeletal muscle myosin light chain kinase. On the ends of both protein will have an EGFP protein that will be in vicinity of each other to give a FRET signal.
https://teams.igem.org/2682	Foundational Advance	Chemically induced dimerization (CID), in which two proteins dimerize only in the presence of a small molecule, has been widely used to control cell signaling, regulatory, and metabolic pathways, and used as logic gates for biological computation in living mammalian cells. However, few naturally occuring CID systems and their derivatives are currently available. Creating a CID system with desired affinity and specificity for any given small molecule remains an unsolved problem for computational design and other protein engineering approaches. To address this challenge, we have used a novel strategy to select CID binders from a vastly diverse combinatorial nanobody library. We have created new CID systems that can sense cholecalciferol and artemisinin. We are validating CID biosensors by a yeast three-hybrid system and built structural models to understand the small molecule-induced dimerization. Our work is a proof-of-concept that can be generalized to create CID systems for many applications.

This standardized toolkit can be used to produce custom PNCs for targeted delivery of various cargos including nucleic acids, proteins, and small molecules to desired cell types. PNC design will be facilitated by our software platform, enabling informed selection of cell-targeting surface modifications, encapsulation proteins, and cargo-loading approaches tailored to the intended application. PNCs have wide-ranging utility from targeted drug delivery and gene therapy to materials synthesis and distribution of biological control agents. With the simplified design, standardized protocols, and modular components, less experienced users will be able to design and produce PNCs in a basic laboratory environment. We have also critically examined the “dual-use” implications of making custom PNC production more accessible and have developed a risk assessment rubric for VINCEnT to help mitigate potential threats.

These dyes would do harm to human health and ecological system. The biological degradation of dyes is an economical and environmentally friendly alternative. Thus, the aim of team SHSBNU_China is to create a biofilm for discoloration of synthetic reactive dyes. The team would use biofilm of E. coli and engineered it to contain the laccase CotA from B. subtilis, which is a polyphenol oxidase that can catalyze the degradation of dyes.

Yet, current immuno-treatments suffer from high costs, limited accessibility, and poor specificity. Our project “CAPOEIRA”, named after the Brazilian self-defense martial-art, exploits the potential of synthetic biology to develop a personalized, cost-effective, and rapid production scheme for cancer vaccine and point-of-care relapse surveillance. First, a bioinformatic pipeline integrating state-of-the-art tools identifies our targets: melanoma neoantigens, the fingerprints of cancer cells. Next, cell-free protein expression rapidly synthesizes a library of encapsulin protein nanocompartments presenting the various neoantigen epitopes. This encapsulin vaccine activates dendritic cells which trigger T-cells’ attack on the neoantigen-bearing cancer cells. Nevertheless, we don’t underestimate a defeated villain! To detect potential relapse, we combine techniques including dumbbell probes, rolling circle amplification, isothermal amplification, and CRISPR-Cas12a to detect circulating tumor miRNA and DNA. Ultimately, CAPOEIRA trains the immune system to retaliate!

The system is based on the production of plants transiently expressing a target protein (TP) fused to granule-bound starch synthase (GBSS). Tissues of GBSS:TP expressing plants will be milled in an aqueous buffer and the starch granules will be purified from plant tissue-derived impurities through a series of simple centrifugation and wash/elution steps allowing the starch granules to precipitate in a highly purified form. The GBSS:TP will be engineered to contain a unique cleavage site recognized by a specific protease, enabling the TP to be separated from the GBSS into the aqueous buffer, while the GBSS remains embedded the starch granule. Once treated with the protease, the starch granules will be removed by centrifugation while the highly purified cleaved TP can be further purified using conventional downstream processing.
https://teams.igem.org/2688	Environment	Cytotoxic anticancer drugs are among the harmful chemicals found in hospital wastewater at high concentrations. Degradation through physical and chemical methods exist but are often inefficient, unsustainable or expensive. We propose MethotrExit, a bioreactor-based approach to tackle this problem. We focused on the biotransformation of methotrexate (MTX), a widely used anticancer drug. We designed synthetic cassettes encoding a new biotransformation pathway using a heterologous carboxypeptidase in Escherichia coli. In only five hours, MethotrExit drastically removes MTX from the media. However, anticancer drug degradation products and/or the biotransformation pathway itself might be toxic for E. coli. To overcome this issue, biobricks generating heterogeneity in enzyme expression were built to ensure survival of a subpopulation. Modeling of this system highlights the interest of a division of labor between “cleaning” and “stem” bacterial cells.

We modify botulinum toxin in a way that leads to its detoxification. Thus, it can be coupled with a variety of other substances while not losing its specific shuttle mechanism for neuronal cells. In detail, we develop a library of different detoxified botulinum toxin derivatives which can accommodate other proteins, small molecules, and fluorochromes by specific linkers. To investigate the influence of the point mutations leading to detoxification in the active site, we conduct MD simulations. Since our shuttle mechanism could potentially be used in patients, we remove the most prevalent immune epitopes by a theoretical bioinformatics approach. Ultimately, our system is supposed to be utilized for therapy strategies and specific neuronal targeting in basic research. With our project we want to encourage future teams to think outside the box while keeping safety in mind.
https://teams.igem.org/2690	High School	Although numerous strains of microalgae have already been identified as being useful for biotechnology purposes, to make commercial up-scaling of algal production cost effective, research into novel approaches to enhance microalgae growth, and their products is needed. Microalgae and bacteria have existed together from the early days of evolution. This co-evolution provides an interesting avenue for industrial biotechnology exploration. Synthetic biology presents us with an opportunity to rationally design and construct microbial communities with well-defined objectives. The co-cultivation of engineered bacteria and micro-algae provides the possibility for enhancing associations between these populations. We aim to engineer a strain of E.coli which will help increase the biomass of microalgae through nutrient-exchange-based mutualism. Our engineered bacterium was designed to express the gene cluster for the biosynthesis of Vibrioferrin, a type of siderophore. Our construct will allow for the increased bioavailability of iron for many species of microalgae once co-cultured.

https://teams.igem.org/2692	High School	Tailings ponds enclose 176 square kilometers of oil extraction waste in Alberta. They pose a serious issue, as they contain toxic products such as heavy metals that negatively affect the environment. Due to the difficulty of its separation, the potentially useful metals present in these tailings ponds are rendered useless. However, our system of bacteria and bacteriophage demonstrates a possible solution. The target metal being copper, we will use a copper-binding protein on bacteriophage capsids to bind the copper. Then, elastin-like polymers attached between the copper binding proteins and the capsid proteins will be used for inducible precipitation, bringing the metals to the bottom of the solution and allowing them to be repurposed. Cu Later is an innovative project by turning the waste in oil sands into opportunity, in addition to cleaning up the environment.

https://teams.igem.org/2694	High School	Through the use of an esterase gene, the engineered bacteria was constructed with the purpose of reducing the accumulation of solidified fat that holds non-biodegradable material together in sewer systems. With the use of DH5ɑ Escherichia coli as the chassis, a plasmid was introduced containing a pLac promoter, and EstA gene. The EstA gene that is found in the Pseudomonas aeruginosa, was inserted in the plasmid with the intention of breaking apart ester bonds which connect the glycerol backbone to the fatty acid. To test the enzyme’s effectiveness, 4-nitrophenol joined to a short chain fatty acid by an ester bond was introduced to the bacteria sample. Once this ester bond is severed, the 4-nitrophenol compound turns green. Preliminary results have shown that the bacteria expressing EstA is capable of breaking the ester bonds within 4-nitrophenol constructs. In the future, our team hopes to achieve the same result with triglycerides.
https://teams.igem.org/2695	WIKI	Mars is a location of scientific interest and the next step in space exploration. NASA’s 2008 Phoenix Rover found that Martian regolith contained up to 1% perchlorate salts, which would leach into crops grown in Martian soil and cause health issues like hypothyroidism. Additionally, transporting the necessary oxygen to a Martian base would be expensive and inefficient. Oxygen production would ideally take place in situ. Our project aims to utilise a GM bacterium that bioremediates perchlorate, reducing it to oxygen. Naturally occurring perchlorate reducing bacteria utilise two enzyme complexes; PcrABCD for perchlorate reductase and Cld for chlorite dismutase. We will insert these genes on two plasmids into <i>E. coli</i>. We’ve worked with stakeholders to design a perchlorate reducing bioreactor that could be integrated into existing life support systems, providing breathable oxygen. Existing methods of perchlorate disposal are explosive, something especially dangerous in space, making this a uniquely synbio project.
https://teams.igem.org/2696	Diagnostics	The common yeast infection, vulvovaginal candidiasis, affects 75% of women throughout their lifetime. This disease is caused by the fungal pathogen Candida albicans, which is also a major cause of systemic candidiasis, a rarer but deadly disease with up to a 49% lethality rate. Existing diagnostics for both infection types are lacking in accessibility, speed, or accuracy – far from the ideal test. This project focuses on creating such a test by detecting farnesol and tyrosol, biomarkers indicative of C. albicans, by binding them to the split proteins pqsR and tyrosinase. Upon binding, a split horseradish peroxidase catalyzes and produces a blue color on a paper test strip by oxidizing the substrate tetramethylbenzidine. This test will produce a colorimetric output for a simple-to-understand diagnosis without any infrastructure. It also may provide an easy and cheap way to diagnose candidiasis worldwide, reducing antifungal abuse.
https://teams.igem.org/2697	Manufacturing	The metabolic engineering of E. coli has significant potential to provide an accessible cellular factory for the in vivo production of essential chemicals during space exploration. Recognizing the versatility of using E. coli for bio-manufacturing during space travel, we investigate applications in polyamine production. In particular, a diamine known as putrescine with medicinal and materials applications. To expand on earlier improvements of the product yield for putrescine in E. coli, we explore modifying the W3110 strain of K-12 E. coli. Additionally, we explore the use of TX-TL cell-free synthetic biology to design transcription factor-based biosensors for the detection of improved putrescine yield and to monitor other small molecules of interest. With these strategies we hope to improve the yield of putrescine in E. coli and to expand the synthetic biology toolkit for metabolic engineering.

https://teams.igem.org/2699	New Application	Our project focuses on demonstrating flotation of Escherichia coli using gas vesicle proteins (GvPs) as a novel cellular separation technique for bioremediation processes. Previous iGEM teams have demonstrated gas vesicle production and flotation in mammalian and yeast cells using GvPs from various bacterial species. Shapiro et al., (2018) engineered a GvP-producing plasmid using arg1 from Aphanizomenon flos-aquae and Bacillus megaterium to synthesize these echogenic structures and observed that high expression enabled E. coli to float. Our goal is to replicate and improve their flotation results by modifying arg1 to achieve consistent flotation using a specific induction protocol. We propose that using this technique may be a cost-effective separation technique for various bioremediation processes. Upon sorption or uptake of pollutants or valuable materials, this technique could allow for simpler extraction of pollutant-harboring or heavy metal-bound bacteria. We have developed a bioreactor model to investigate this claim.
https://teams.igem.org/2700	Village	Distributing metabolic pathways between microbial community members has shown significant potential for the large-scale production of complex, biologically-derived chemical products. Our goal is to address the challenge of regulating population dynamics in a synthetic microbial consortium, by improving the rate of production of naringenin and its pharmaceutically significant derivative, kaempferol, which has anti-cancer properties. This is done by distributing the synthesis of kaempferol between two E. coli strains and optimizing their relative proportions in co-culture. To optimize population dynamics for the production of kaempferol, we regulated the ratio of the two strains using GP2, a transcriptional inhibitor, under the control of a biosensor responsive to the pathway intermediate naringenin. This couples cell growth with the concentration of naringenin, allowing the co-culture to self-optimize based on pathway intermediate abundance. Using our system, we have demonstrated a novel way to optimize microbial polycultures for the synthesis of metabolically complex compounds.

https://teams.igem.org/2702	Diagnostics	We plan on developing a melatonin biosensor. Our approach for the biosensor is to genetically modify Saccharomyces cerevisiae by integrating a highly specific human melatonin receptor into the cells. Melatonin has a high membrane permeability which permits us to use the nuclear retinoid z receptor (RZR) which is directly regulating gene expression. We express the RZR as a fusion-protein with the recognition sequence of the human estrogen receptor alpha (ERα). When melatonin is bound, the modified receptor binds to the estrogen receptor responsive element (ERE) and as a consequence regulate expression of firefly luciferase reporter genes. In our second approach, we will use the membrane-receptor MT1 for our biosensor. When melatonin binds to the G protein-coupled receptor, β-arrestins can be recruited. This mechanism allows us to use an enzyme fragment complementation assay based on two fusion-proteins.
https://teams.igem.org/2703	Village	Sugar is the main source of energy for the cell factories used in synthetic biology. However, its massive production has dramatic impacts on the environment. Therefore, in order to bring a solution to this serious environmental issue, we want to engineer a green microalgae, Chlamydomonas reinhardtti, to allow an ecofriendly sugar production within marine waters, limiting the competition with arable lands. Moreover, to be able to spread the use of microalgae as a chassis, more genetic tools to engineer it are still required. To do so, we will enrich the recently developed Modular Cloning (MoClo) toolkit for C. reinhardtti with a synthetic retrotransposon to generate in vivo continuous directed evolution. It will be the first time that such genetic tool is applied to non-baring plasmid cells such as microalgae. This approach enables the generation of new proteins with tailor-made functional properties as well as the optimization of biological systems.

https://teams.igem.org/2705	New Application	Biosynthesis enables renewable and environment-friendly production of various compounds. However, present biosynthetic performances still await improvements to be cost competitive with petroleum-based chemical synthesis and suitable for large-scale industrial production. In order to achieve this goal, many approaches have been created, among which the Population Quality Control ( PopQC ) system is proved efficient. In our project, a PopQC system was developed as a plasmid based gene circuit in Bacillus amyloliquefaciens LL3 to continuously select high-performing cells in order to improve the yield of target metabolite, glutamate. In the presence of our PopQC system, high-producers stayed alive while low-producers were unable to survive. Consequently, the average intracellular concentration as well as the yield of glutamate among the population was enhanced, which finally led to the yield enhancement of poly-γ-glutamate, a high-value-added secondary metabolite.
https://teams.igem.org/2706	Manufacturing	BASSET aims to engineer E. coli to produce biofuel (short-chained alkanes) in a microbial electrosynthesis (MES) system. For this year, BASSET produces alkanes from fatty acyl-ACPs. This aim is achieved by heterologous expression of Pmt1231 (from Prochlorococcus marinus) and Acr (from Clostridium acetobutylicum), overexpression of the endogenous FadK and a mutant TesA. The engineered organism is tailored for future use in a MES. In the MES, E. coli will accept electrons from an external source (for example, off-peak excess of solar energy). This energy will power the biosynthesis pathway by producing reducing equivalents such as NADH or NADPH in the cell.
https://teams.igem.org/2707	Foundational Advance	Mitochondria harbor relatively independent genome, the uniqueness of which enables S.cerevisiae to be widely used in the study of mitochondrial loss and relevant diseases. The mitochondrial genome size varies prodigiously between different yeasts, positively correlated with the size of intergenic regions and introns. This year, we boldly try to design and synthesize a minimal S. cerevisiae mitochondrial genome from scratch (39k). We employed bioinformatics algorithms to analyze the function and conservation of various parts of the original mitochondrial genome, providing a criterion for determining the non-essential sequences that could be deleted. The complexity of the mitochondrial genome sequence, low GC content and the existence of local GC clusters make it difficult to synthesize the genome, which was solved by specialised separation, parameter optimization, etc. This genome will be transferred into S. cerevisiae cells that have lost mitochondria genome, verify their function, feed back the result and optimize our original design.
https://teams.igem.org/2708	Diagnostics	Last year, our JACOB 1.0 used the competitive reaction between target protein and aptamer-complementary chain complexes to achieve signal conversion for sample markers' early detection. This year, we adopted the idea of JACOB, detect CKMB protein to monitor myocardial infarction. Then, in order to adapt to different needs of detection. We designed two sets of independent fluorescent expression systems that each has advantages. One is to modify the molecule SAM on the complementary chain, and to control engineering bacteria to produce GFP by using SAM-riboswitch. Another method is to combine the Spinach Probe with the complementary strand to form a stem loop structure to capture the Fluorescein (DFHBI) then produce fluorescence. We designed microfluidic chip that can carry the whole biological reaction process. We integrated the peristaltic pump on it also, so the chip and detection equipment are completely separated, which greatly reducing the volume of the overall instrument.
https://teams.igem.org/2709	Diagnostics	Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a virus with ~35% mortality rate, considered to be one of the most likely to cause major epidemics. We aim to develop a rapid, low-cost test for MERS-CoV for potential use in field diagnosis. Our biosensor is based on the toehold switch mechanism. The designed switches regulate the expression of trehalase, an enzyme which hydrolyzes the disaccharide trehalose to glucose. Thus, overall, the presence of viral load in the sample triggers glucose production, which is measured by a repurposed glucometer, signaling the diagnosis. Finally, attempting to accelerate the diagnosis, we lower the complexity of the switches using an alternative reporter, an engineered split trehalase. The two split fragments assemble to a functional enzyme through coiled-coil interactions. Our proposed diagnostic workflow is easily customizable for the detection of other viruses threatening global health, aiming to contribute to travel medicine and diagnostics.
https://teams.igem.org/2710	Foundational Advance	Metabolic engineering aims to produce complex high-value compounds for industry from simpler and cheaper substrates by enhancing rates of reaction. The rates of metabolic reactions can be greatly enhanced by substrate channelling, which spatially brings together the enzymes of a multi-step reaction, increasing the effective concentration of metabolic intermediates. We have designed a novel protein scaffold that specifically and covalently co-localises enzymes in a modular system. Our ‘Assemblase’ system consists of a heterohexameric complex of a highly thermostable and chemical resistant archaeal protein, prefoldin, which has been engineered to recruit enzymes using covalent protein-protein interactions. The design is being tested with a two step enzyme pathway to produce the horticultural plant hormone, indole 3-acetic acid, from tryptophan. We propose that the Assemblase system could be used for accelerating the production of pharmaceuticals and industrial chemicals, bioremediation and as a foundational research tool.
https://teams.igem.org/2711	WIKI	During their lifetime 75% of women will experience a Candida albicans infection, one of the most common vulvovaginal yeast infections. Currently there are no fast methods to detect whether an infection is caused by C. albicans. As a result, women purchase over-the-counter antimycotics without knowing the cause of their infection. This contributes to the rise of antimycotic resistance, making treatment of future infections more difficult. Based on previous projects, UiOslo_Norway aims to develop a fast detection kit for C. albicans infections, using CRISPR/dCas9. Upon a suspected infection, a vaginal sample will be treated with glucanase to selectively lyse yeast cells walls, exposing the fungal DNA. Afterwards, modified dCas9 enzymes fused with split β-lactamase are added. Using specifically designed guideRNAs, the dCas9 complexes bind adjacently on C. albicans specific DNA sequences. This activates the β-lactamase to cleave its substrate nitrocefin, producing a colored product indicating the presence of C. albicans DNA.
https://teams.igem.org/2712	Manufacturing	Many industrial manufacturing processes revolve around the molecule 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3HP). This organic molecule can be used in a variety of industrial products, from biofuels to bioplastic production. While much research is focusing on maximizing the production of this important molecule, our team belongs to a smaller subset focused on finding ways to sense and measure its production. In a recent study, genes from the bacteria Pseudomonas putida were incorporated into Escherichia coli and demonstrated that re-purposed regulatory proteins from P. putida could be used as a biosensor for 3HP (Hanko et al. 2017). A separate study identified similar 3HP responsive genes in Pseudomonas denitrificans (Zhou et al. 2015). Our research team has transformed a promoter-regulator system that recognizes 3HP into Bacillus subtilis. B. subtilis is a hardy bacterium that has great potential as a 3HP producer for industrial processes and metabolic engineering experiments.

A biological approach to resolving this problem is favorable because of its practicality and efficiency. Ideonella sakaiensis is a bacteria that naturally decomposes polyethylene terephthalate, we have decided to genetically modify E. coli cells to model the plastic degradation process by adding the Lipase and Chlorogenate Esterase genes from Ideonella sakaiensis into E. coli bacterial cells.
https://teams.igem.org/2715	Therapeutics	Clostridium difficile infections are the primary cause of healthcare associated diarrhea, with hypervirulent outbreaks becoming increasingly common across the globe. It is predicted that $6.3 billion is spent annually on treating C. difficile in the U.S alone. Patients who have undergone treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics are at a high risk of being infected by this opportunistic pathogen, because their native gut flora is more likely to exist in a dysbiotic state. Our project aims to engineer a lysogenic bacteriophage with genetic constructs that will suppress the toxin production in C. difficile. We will use two different strategies to achieve this: an antisense RNA system capable of inhibiting translation of toxin transcripts, and a dead Cas9 mechanism to impede transcription of the toxin genes. Ultimately, we intend to produce a novel phage therapy capable of reducing toxigenicity of resident C. difficile without affecting native gastrointestinal microbiota.
https://teams.igem.org/2716	Environment	A recently discovered bacteria, Ideonella sakaiensis, degrades polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic into ethylene glycol and terephthalic acid using the enzymes PETase and MHETase. As genetic engineering methods have not been well-developed for this organism, we are engineering this pathway into Escherichia coli, a model organism. Other researchers have mutated PETase’s active site to increase its substrate turnover. We are cloning the DNA sequences of these mutated enzymes into an E. coli plasmid and developing a second plasmid to overexpress the native E.coli enzymes for ethylene glycol metabolism. With both plasmids, the transformed bacteria should be able to survive solely off the PET carbon. The only byproduct would be terephthalic acid, a precipitate which can be recycled into new plastic. Computer simulations of the pathway gave us predictive degradation rates at optimum conditions. Implementation of these bacteria in the future could address the concern of plastic build-up in our world.

However, screening these mutants costs vast time and workforce, and it is difficult to avoid using antibiotics. We applies synthetic biology methods, constructing a novel pathway to screen mutants by giving target strains growth advantages. Here, utilizing AND gate, the gene of interest expresses to a certain level, making the downstream pchAB gene express and catalyze the generation of salicylic acid（SA）. SA can activate the expression of glucose dehydrogenase, which gives the target strains an additional growth advantage. Besides, we integrate the most important control module of the system into the genome using Chemically Inducible Chromosomal Evolution(CIChE). In summary, the target strain will finally obtain the greatest growth advantage in bacterial suspensions and achieve screening internally. This new screening method is simple to operate and provides a new idea for antibiotic-free screening.

In fact, they developed multiple resistance mechanisms (exoskeleton thickening and enhanced metabolic pathways). The breaking bugs project aims to provide a human-friendly, and efficient solution to eliminate bed bugs. The plan is to elaborate an attractive lethal trap. We will use biosynthesized pheromones as a chemical lure to attract the bugs into the trap and infect them with <i>Beauveria bassiana</i> (an entomopathogenic fungus), causing a fatal epidemic. We produced several types of pheromones in <i>E. coli</i> and are running tests to create the optimal pheromone cocktail. We have worked on producing several enzymes and adding adjuvants to improve the killing efficiency and speed of the fungus. We had nationwide advertising of our project and obtained an indisputable validation from the public for our engagement in fighting bed bugs.

Representing the third cause of infant mortality in Mexico, it stands for an urgent issue to assess. This project approaches such problematique with the design of a multi-glycopeptide scaffold and the recombinant growth factor Leptin B to induce fibroblast proliferation. Nanoencapsulation was employed to ensure proper delivery and distribution. Growth measurements were evaluated through cell image analysis and lactate dehydrogenase activity as an indirect indicator, obtained from the culture medium in the MiniSkin Simulator, which is a hardware to test molecules in a 3D culture. This system could enhance tissue regeneration, minimizing infection risks and treatment lapses for affected patients with second degree burns.
https://teams.igem.org/2720	WIKI	Poly(ethyleneterephthalate) (PET) is a prevalent material which can is used in various applications, while bringing adverse effects to the environment. An enzyme, PETase, can degrade the highly-crystalized PET to mono-(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid (MHET), terephthalate and Bis(2-Hydroxyethyl) terephthalate. MHET is also further decomposed by MHETase to terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol (EG). EG can be further broken down in E. coli K-12 to produce carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide, however, is a notable greenhouse gas. Using the mutagenesis of the amino acid residues of nifD in nitrogenase, the substrate binding site can be modified so that carbon dioxide can undergo the multi-electron reduction to methane. We propose an efficient carbon dioxide reduction system with the decomposition of PET as the primary carbon source. PETase, MHETase, and amino acid substituted nitrogen fixation genes in MoFe nitrogenase will be expressed in a fast-growing bacterium, E. coli.

Worldwide implementation of bacteriophage therapy, a 100-year old treatment employing the natural enemies of bacteria, is impeded by the lack of common manufacturing procedures which meet international quality and safety standards. Based on synthetic biology we created Phactory, a cell-free molecular assembly line for bacteriophages. We demonstrate expression of several phages including T7, MS2 and 3S at clinically relevant concentrations. Exploiting the open nature of cell-free systems, Phactory enables modular composition of bacteriophages with engineered proteins while remaining GMO-free. We developed a quality control structure utilizing state-of-the-art bioinformatics, as well as purification and encapsulation protocols. To expand our production variety while reducing cost, we optimized and engineered home-made E. Coli cell-extract. Compared to traditional manufacturing procedures, Phactory requires 2.5% of the production volume and demands no special biosafety regulations to yield bacteriophages ready for therapy.

Tenzyme Vilu project will expand this goal to design a platform to obtain functional aptazymes for biosensing other marine toxins. For this, we have fully characterized adenosine monophosphate (AMP) aptazyme to further investigate aptazymes molecules as a diagnostic platform for other marine toxins. In order to improve the affinity of the aptazymes with its respective ligand, we have tested alternative sequences by using a rational design to avoid false negative or positive detections that can eventually arise when analysing raw samples. Then, by using our approach we developed novel aptazymes for sensing different HAB toxins, such as paralytic, diarrheic and amnesic shellfish toxins. Finally, a cell-free cellulose matrix device with different lyophilized aptazyme will be tested to evaluate the presence of different marine toxins.

However, the inability to release synthetic biology inhibits its usefulness, and limits its potential in solving global and localised problems. At team Maxed OOT we believe we have the solution… Maxicells! Maxicells are achromosomal E. coli cells that cannot replicate. Maxicells remain metabolically active following the loss of their chromosome and express genes given to them on an ‘instructor plasmid’. In our project we analyse the most efficient methods for maxicell production, quantify their active metabolic timeframe, and characterise them as a biosensor. Additionally, we present our triple lock system for preventing horizontal gene transfer. The resulting novel chassis could re-contextualise many previous Synthetic Biology projects and open doors for the field as a whole.

Due to their overuse, we have created bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics, and there are cases of bacteria that are resistant to multiple antibiotics, so called “superbugs”, such as Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus(MRSA). They pose an enormous risk to human health in the coming decades. We focused on utilizing the quorum sensing system of S. aureus to build a sensitivity switch, dependent on the concentration of the autoinducing peptide (AIP) that it uses to detect it’s population density, and become virulent and break away from the biofilm. Our system will hijack the system and trigger production of a phage that will specifically target S. aureus and deliver a kill mechanism. This system will be able to safely treat S. aureus and avoid perpetuating the problem of creating new resistant species.

As a result, an increasing number of buildings are constructed and renovated, and problems of indoor air quality in newly decorated houses become more and more serious. Formaldehyde existing in paint and furniture may cause asthma, or even potentially leukemia. It is commonly acknowledged that formaldehyde volatile is very hard to control as it has long volatilization period. Unfortunately, current methods to remove formaldehyde are mostly either inefficient or expensive. Therefore, our project aims to develop an engineered E.coli to detect and eliminate the indoor formaldehyde safely and efficiently, when the concentration of which exceeds the legal limitation. By emitting florescence, the E.coli indicates the presence of formaldehyde and its effectiveness. Besides, the design of replaceable freeze-dried E.coli ensures the durability of the product. In this way, we would like to provide people with a real “formaldehunter”.

Dengue virus is unique in terms of its four different serotypes. Multiple infection can easily cause severe dengue, appearing hemorrhage and organ damage. It is important to grasp which serotype the patient is infected, however, there is not enough data about each serotype in a year. To tackle the situation, we succeeded in the development of the serotype prediction system using stochastic process analysis. This system can predict the patient's serotype by simulating the past data. We also developed the simple and fast testing kit that can detect serotype with fluorescence, so that we can check the patient easily and get enough data to estimate the patients’ serotypes more accurate.

Neoantigen is Individualized and is a promising concept to be used in cancer treatment. Type III secretion system (T3SS) acts as a promising tool for protein delivery directly into the target cells. We establish a method which can deliver neoantigens into immune system using the Type III secretion system of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We select the colorectal cancer as our target and use the bioinformatic method to filter our item antigens. Then we use the T3SS to deliver the item antigens into immune system through orally intake of engineered attenuated bacteria. Since for the T3SS, there are almost no restrictions on the delivery of short peptide antigens, this method has the flexibility to be adapted to, if there are effective neoantigens, any specific cancer patient.

Candida albicans becomes pathogenic after a phenotype switch from white-to-opaque or opaque-to-white, depending on the infection site. Here, we cloned the 5’ UTR of the master white-opaque phenotypic regulator WOR1 into a vector to act as a protein sequestration sequence. To confirm successful cloning of the 5’ UTR and expression of our vector, we used E. coli as our model organism. Once integrated into the Candida albicans genome, our genetically engineered part should sequester transcriptional regulating proteins away from the WOR1 gene and alter the phenotypic switching tied to the pathogenicity of Candida albicans.

The use of GRAS microorganisms to convert natural raw materials into aroma compounds can be described as natural products, which have been considered as one of the most promising strategies. However, fermentive TFFCs produced by engineered microbes mostly only obtain intermediates or low yields of end-product currently. This study proposes a non-conditional yeast Yarrowia lipolytica as a chassis for TFFCs production, in which limonene was chose as target product. By employing synthetic biology technology including gibson assembly, CRISPR/Cas9 and protein scaffold, we develop a high-performance enzyme self-assembling system (HESS) to rewiring the pathway into limonene accumulation. Furthermore, the MVA pathway will be enhanced by overexpression of two rate-limiting enzymes (HMG1 and ERG12) for increasing the production.

These contaminants are often difficult to detect. We therefore developed Detaxion, a biosensor to rapidly identify chemical contaminants in water. Detaxion is based on the E. coli chemotaxis system. We engineered the CheY and CheZ chemotaxis proteins to form a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) pair. Upon binding of chemicals to the TAR chemotaxis receptor, BRET fluorescence emission changes in a quantifiable manner. We additionally used receptor ligand binding domain swapping to expand the range of detectable chemicals. Finally, we modified receptor methylation sites to extend the detection range. Our results thus far show successful fluorescence energy transfer. Moreover, we used a capillary-based assay to confirm BRET measurements. Taken together, Detaxion constitutes a synthetic biology-based approach to detect chemical waste in water, to safeguard this vital resource.
https://teams.igem.org/2737	Environment	The global cost of blocking and corrosion in cooling towers is estimated to be several billion dollars each year, which mainly results from the colonization of microbes. The microbes cause the formation of corroded objections and biofilm, directly leading to severe blocking. In this year, ECUST iGEM is trying to solve the problem by synthetic biology, presenting a totally new idea. By constructing engineered Escherichia coli, we design an integrated gene circuit which assembles sensing, cleaning rust, eliminating biofilm and killing iron bacteria. The microbes in pipelines will firstly be sensed through quorum sensing, then two key substances will be secreted to clear rust and biofilm respectively. When this method achieves the certain effect, the expression of antimicrobial peptides and autolysins will be triggered to kill the bacteria without adhesion ability, basically preventing the pipelines from being blocked again.
https://teams.igem.org/2738	WIKI	Antibiotic overuse in livestock industry is one of the major drivers to the antibiotic resistance evolution; motivating calls to reduce, replace, and re-think the antibiotic usage in animals. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a promising alternative to conventional antibiotics. Recently, a class of chemically-synthesized, star-shaped AMPs has been shown to exhibit broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity while maintaining biocompatibility with mammalian cells. In this project, we combinatorially fused a set of known AMPs to structurally diverse, self-assembling protein cores to produce star-shaped complexes. Over 200 fusions were designed and expressed in a cell-free system, then screened for activity, biocompatibility, and membrane selectivity. In addition, we selected 4 AMPs for rational mutagenesis (~12000 variants), and a subset of fusions for molecular dynamic modeling, to identify features of surface charge and star geometry that impact AMP performance. Overall, we aim to create a novel class of selective, non-toxic AMPs which are biologically-produced.
https://teams.igem.org/2739	Manufacturing	Among the pressing issues towards bio-based alternatives to plastic, cost-efficiency and truly sustainable models remain a challenge. As our proposed solution, we are investigating the production of polyhydroxybutyrate-co-valerate (PHBV) by looking not only at using industrial co-products as substrate but also improving downstream processing. PHBV and other polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) are thermoplastics that can be designed with bespoke physical properties based on their relative compositions. By introducing heterologous genes (phaCAB) from Cupriavidus necator, we engineered recombinant Escherichia coli to produce PHBV using co-products from local whisky distilleries. Furthermore, we have designed a secretion system to reduce costs associated with current extraction methods. To complement this, we are developing not only in silico metabolic models for optimized polymer synthesis but also macro-scale models to assess the environmental and economic impact of these products in their life cycles.

We use the engineered E. coli cells to express nitrogenase and in-situ synthesize of CdS semiconductors in the biohybrid system. Instead of ATP-hydrolysis, such system is able to photocatalytic N2(nitrogen) to NH3(ammonia). The biohybrid system based on engineered E. coli cells with biosynthesis inorganic materials will likely become an alternative approach for the convenient utilization of solar energy.
https://teams.igem.org/2741	High School	Quorum sensing, a form of bacterial cell-to-cell communication reflecting cell population fluctuations, can be adapted to facilitate multi-population collaboration. Our project combines two different QS systems to create a novel feedback loop in an E.coli co-culture, where each population synthesizes a different fluorescent protein in response to the other population’s autoinducer production. Population A is a LuxS knockout that produces AI-1 and RFP in response to AI-2, while Population B secretes a constant level of AI-2 and expresses GFP in response to AI-1. In co-culture, each population induced fluorescence in the other, indicating a successful two-way quorum sensing system. In the process, we also generated novel characterization data for two Biobricks, demonstrating for the first time that BBa_K575024 exhibits minimal leaky expression and is dose-dependent over a range of realistic AI-1 concentrations (5-1000 nM). We also provide the first evidence that BBa_K575026 is induced by AI-1.
https://teams.igem.org/2742	Environment	Chemical pollution resulting from large-scale industrial practices can result in volatile organic compound (VOC) accumulation in water supplies. One VOC of interest, dichloroacetate (DCA), is a chlorinated carcinogenic contaminant at clinically high levels. Similarly, dichloromethane (DCM), is used for various industrial applications but its accumulation in water systems poses a threat to aquatic organisms and is considered a carcinogenic to humans. The goal of the UT Knoxville iGEM Team is to design biological systems in E. coli capable of degrading DCA and DCM in order to remove them from the water supply and metabolize them within the cell. Through the addition of Haloacid Dehalogenase (HADase) genes capable of breaking down DCA as well as the development of a DCM biosensor, we are generating biological organisms in order to facilitate our access to clean drinking.

Our challenge is to create genetically engineered yeast producing cat pheromone-based biosynthetic deterrent and prepare a device capable of diffusing this cat pheromone to areas surrounding grain storage facilities, thereby keeping murines away. Our first aim is to transform our host system, S. cerevisiae, with necessary synthetic gene circuits which will result in a recombineered yeast that mimics the cat nephron pathway for producing felinine. Next, we will conduct controlled experiments in the form of murine behavior assays to test the effectiveness of our synthetically derived felinine as a rat/mouse deterrent. Finally, we intend to design user-friendly and field-effective hardware to integrate with our yeast cells and run simulations on field data to understand murine behavior in realistic conditions and over a reasonable time-frame, with the intention of designing software for optimal dispersal of our FerOmone.
https://teams.igem.org/2745	High School	Our team finds that lactic acid produced by Lactobacillus delbruckii ND02 is an acid with considerable effect of biofilm degradation. In order to support Lactobacillus delbruckii for acid secretion, lysozyme is used to hydrolyze polysaccharides in the biofilm to smaller fragments of mono and disaccharides. Sequence that codes for lysozyme is combined with sequence of Lactobacillus breris that codes for S-layer protein signal peptide, which promotes the secretion of lysozyme. The combined sequence is then transferred to the acid producing Lactobacillus delbruckii for expression.With nutrients provided by hydrolyzed polysaccharides, Lactobacillus delbruckii secretes lactic acid that further degrades the biofilm. As the pH of the system gradually decreases, the ability of Lactobacillus delbruckii adhering to biofilm increases, In addition, hydrogen peroxide is secreted for sterilization when the pH drops below 3. This produces a positive feedback loop for biofilm degradation and its effect is expected to be significant.

https://teams.igem.org/2748	Therapeutics	CAR-T therapy is one of the most promising treatment for cancer, with multiple ongoing clinical trials worldwide and 2 therapies approved by the FDA. However, without proper control after administration of CAR-T cells, severe adverse effects may bring fatal risks to the patients, especially during the clinical trial stages. While suicide switches serve as common methods for controlling adverse effects, they completely halt the expensive treatment, and repeating the treatment process could be a burden for the patients, both physically and financially. To provide a safer yet affordable CAR-T therapy, we developed a reversible safe switch controlled by small molecules called CAR BRAKE. By expressing U24 protein of the human herpesvirus 6A under the control of tet-ON promoter, we can downregulate CAR molecules on the cell surface through endosomal recycling inhibition. This could potentially be used as a universal add-on for all CAR-Ts and TCR-Ts to ensure safety.
https://teams.igem.org/2749	Environment	Indiscriminate spitting of red-colored catechu (Paan-) based products is a common practice in India. Paan stains tarnish public places and historical monuments in the country. Although a considerable amount of resources are invested in cleaning these stubborn red-stains, existing methods are ineffective in removing them. Our team designed a dual-component ecologically contained system that will remove these stains more efficiently. The first module employs a four-enzyme system that breaks down the stains into non-toxic byproducts in a targeted manner. The second module interfaces with this degradation system to trigger the destruction of the system’s DNA from the environment as a safety measure after the stain-fighting enzymes have been produced. Given the enormity of this social issue, we take a holistic approach to actively engage our community and learn from industry experts, users, cleaners, and policy makers how to effectively remove existing stains as well as prevent new ones.
https://teams.igem.org/2750	Software	Designing genetic circuits and protocols by teamwork is pervasive for synthetic biologists, but it's still hard to cooperate with partners using traditional collaborative software for the complexity and hierarchy in synbio design. Here, we develop an open-access software CO-RAD to facilitate the collaboration, recommendation and analysis for the synthetic biologists. CO-RAD allows users to edit circuits and protocols online while collaborating with other users in real-time. For assisting users in optimizing their circuits, we strengthen CO-RAD's ability of recommendation and analysis. After designing circuits in embedded design platform easily, users will get similar circuits from our interactive database by collaborative filtering algorithm. Users can also acquire various projects information efficiently through our search engine. Based on directed evolution algorithm, our software can simulate performance of circuits and provide suggestion of optimization. Moreover, some deep level information of circuit sequence can be showed in our software concisely.

This year, the NYMU iGEM team aims to introduce a quick and convenient drug-screening platform to determine the effectiveness of hair loss product without animal or human testing. The cause of AGA is believed to be highly related to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a derivative of testosterone that can possibly trigger the production of DKK-1 protein. DKK-1 protein can possibly inhibit the growth of root sheath cells in hair follicles and eventually lead to hair loss. The system that our team designed demonstrates a convenient platform to measure the amount of secreted DKK-1 protein, which provides a novel method for the screening of AGA drugs.
https://teams.igem.org/2752	Therapeutics	Hyperuricemia refers to the symptom that the level of uric acid is unusually high in ,blood. It commonly affects joints and leads to the gouty arthritis which are shown as joint deformity. At present, the drugs for treatment of hyperuricemia show a strong side effect. Urate oxidase is an enzyme in organism that catalyzes the oxidation of uric acid in purine metabolism. It oxidizes uric acid to allantoin. Allantoin can be easily metabolized by the kidneys. To solve the above problems, introduced the gene encoding humanized urate oxidase into E. coli Nissle. After the patient consumes these bacteria, the recombinant strain will remain in the patient's intestine. When the uric acid concentration reaches the threshold, the strain can secrete urate oxidase which can reach the blood of the patient. In addition, we have set up a microbial population control and in vitro lethal system to make our strains safer.

It has a common precursor, nepetalactol, with other plant-derived compounds of great therapeutic value, such as vincristine (an anti-cancer drug). We aim to synthesize nepetalactol through the co-culture of E. coli and yeast where E. coli generates the intermediate geraniol, and yeast continue to convert geraniol to nepetalactol. Endogenous genes in yeast are deleted to reduce shunt products. Besides, we design, characterize, and use a library of transcription activator-like effectors (TALE) stabilized promoter to regulate the heterologous gene expression in E. coli. Our applied design conceives the future application of nepetalactone on stray cat control, which we consider as an opportunity for public engagement and education.
https://teams.igem.org/2754	Village	Bacterial biofilm formation is a profound challenge in treating wounds, inserting prostheses in patients or on equipment in different production industries. Communication between bacteria and coordination of biofilm formation is mediated by the quorum sensing mechanism. Here we utilize a CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) system to inhibit Escherichia coli’s quorum sensing mechanism by knocking down the luxS gene. The luxS gene encodes the synthase “S-ribosylhomocysteine lysae”, which is responsible for synthesis of the Autoinducer-2 (AI-2) quorum sensing molecule. We implemented the CRISPRi system in E. coli DH5α and TG1 and measured the biofilm production by Crystal Violet assays. We were able to significantly reduce TG1’s biofilm formation, while DH5α showed results with high variability. Experimental approaches for reducing biofilm formation have the potential to illuminate unknown underlying processes in biofilm formation and possibly reveal treatments for the challenges that biofilms account for.

https://teams.igem.org/2757	Therapeutics	Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is characterised by chronic inflammation of the intestine. The condition is associated with an imbalance in immune cell populations, notably Th17 and Treg. Existing immunosuppressive therapies, when successful, often elicit systemic side effects and require frequent readministration. Our solution is to develop a probiotic strain that restores the Th17/Treg cell balance via secretion of IL-10 in response to nitric oxide in the intestinal lumen. Overshoot is prevented by an adenine riboswitch-sRNA construct which responds to extracellular adenosine, an indicator of the Treg cell population. Integration of separate stimuli in a dual feedback loop enables a more dynamic, robust response to the immune state of the body. Various features have been incorporated to maximise biological safety, including an inducible kill switch system. We believe our design offers a non-invasive, self-tuning therapeutic for IBD, with potential to replace conventional immunosuppressants in the treatment of gastrointestinal autoimmune disorders.

Our first construct contains a Hg accumulator and Green Fluorescence protein (GFP) to detect and accumulate the Hg. The second construct, with delayed expressed of a Killer Red (KR) protein, will kill the bacteria in response to light. We aim to characterize the delayed expression of the KR protein under three different RBSs using unique constructs. The construct enabling delayed expression of the KR protein will be coupled with GFP/accumulator construct. We are building the GFP/accumulator construct using overlapping PCR. Finally, we are designing and creating a container optimizing the efficiency of detection and removal of Hg from fish meal.
https://teams.igem.org/2759	WIKI	Water pollution originates from many contaminants and antibiotic waste is one of them. Antibiotics which remain in waste water after a treatment may cause bacteria to become multi resistant. In result of this, bacterial infections could spread rapidly and without having an efficient treatment. Current chemical methods of water purification require high cost and energy to be effective. To solve this problem with a cheaper method, our team modified bacteria to bind penicillin remains in waste water. The bacteria produce biofilms which on the surface has penicillin binding peptides attached to csgA proteins. We aim to target beta-lactam rings of the penicillin with these peptides. Our modified bacteria produces an iron-storage protein, bacterioferritin. Then using a magnetic field, we plan to pull away the penicillin-captured-bacteria to which we have added magnetic property with bacterioferritin proteins.

Although there are several therapeutic strategies available, treatments targeting the gut-brain axis are gaining importance due to the strong relationship between alterations in the microbiota, systemic inflammation, and psychiatric disorders. Therefore, we aimed to develop a novel approach for the treatment and prevention of depression and anxiety. For this, we will genetically engineer a strain of Lactobacillus rhamnosus to detect increases in the levels of stress in the body. This psychobiotic, which we have termed “Lactobachill”, will secrete soluble receptors (i.e., sgp130 and a mutated variant of sgp80) that could selectively inhibit the aberrant trans-signaling pathway of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6. We will also characterize the efficiency of secretion of these receptors, which will be coupled to bacterial signal peptides from Sec-dependent pathways. We envision that Lactobachill could be used as an adjunct to current treatments against anxiety and depression.

This year, iGEM team Tec-Monterrey aims to use the CRISPR-Cas system to store specific DNA sequences in the genome of E. coli in order to save information about the environment surrounding the bacteria. To make this possible, Cas1-Cas2 proteins, which create the protospacer acquisition in the CRISPR system, are used to insert a synthetic DNA sequence in the CRISPR array within the genome of the bacteria. This synthetic sequence is produced by a second system, called SCRIBE. The final step of our project is reading out the inserted DNA sequence. Using specific primers for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are used to amplify a section of the CRISPR array where the sequence is inserted. Taking together both systems, our project intends to act as a biological tape recorder capable of sensing external stimuli in the environment and storing their presence in the genome.

Just 2017 alone the global emission level grew by 1.4%. This year, the 2018 iGEM NCKU Tainan team will design a device capable of piping CO2 and convert it into biomass via integrating a non-native Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle into E. coli using the RuBisCO and PRK genes from Synechococcus sp, which encode for major enzymes involved in carbon fixation. Industrial gases will enter a pipe (inlet) at the bottom of a bioreactor, flow through a ceramic nozzle and mix with E. coli-containing mixture which also consumes CO2. “Of CO2urse” is an alternative to utilize excess CO2. Our ultimate goal is to convert CO2 into useful bioproducts. It would be one step closer towards a low carbon society.

Meanwhile, traditional PET treatment methods have problems such as high cost, insufficient degradation, and secondary pollution. Therefore, we have constructed an engineering strain that can degrade PET and convert it into a carbon source. We are going to use Corynebacterium glutamicum in our project which is a food-grade microorganism that is commonly used in the industrial production of foods and amino acids. Our bacteria will firstly degrade PET to p-Phthalic acid(TPA) and Ethylene glycol(EG). Secondly, they will catalyze the TPA to protocatechuatePCA and finally to PDC, which can participate in TCA cycle to provide energy for cell growth and development. All in all, our engineered bacteria have the advantage of effectively degrading PET at a lower cost without secondary pollution.

Our team recognizes the opportunity to further advance this project by addressing another key issue – energy. Using Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 strain’s inbuilt extracellular electron transport mechanism in tandem with genes responsible for alkane metabolism derived from Desulfatibacillum alkenivorans, we will generate electricity from the metabolism of degraded polyethylene, hoping that it will one day help in solving the world’s growing energy needs.

Now many antioxidants adding in food, cosmetic and some medical production claim they can clear oxidative damages. Although many methods of measuring antioxidants capability are precise in vitro, there is no standard method for living cell. Therefore our project is to construct a system which can determine the activity of antioxidants in vivo. We chose Saccharomyces. cerevisiae as host and accumulated ROS by overexpressing genes. After reacting with antioxidants, the remaining ROS could reflect the antioxidant activity which could be detected by a redox sensor, roGFP2-Orp1. Additionally, a feedback gene circuit was set to avoid the overproduction of ROS which injured our yeast. Compared with the traditional methods, our system requires a milder environment, damage-free and with higher biologically relevant which make our system more reliable.

Nosema infections cause energetic stress in bees and decreases their immune response. The detrimental effects of Nosema can lead to lower hive productivity, and ultimately colony failure. To counteract this infection, Team UAlberta designed an Antifungal Porphyrin-based Intervention System (APIS) to treat Nosema infections in honey bees. APIS uses a modified heme biosynthesis pathway in Escherichia coli to overproduce protoporphyrin IX (PPIX), the eighth intermediate in the pathway. When ingested, PPIX-like molecules have been shown to decrease N. ceranae spore load in infected bees. Re-introducing the heme pathway in E. coli controlled by an inducible promoter overproduces PPIX using existing cell machinery. APIS allows bypassing of mechanisms regulating the endogenous pathway. Our system allows for directly introducing the bacteria into bees, as well as the mass production of PPIX in bioreactors.

https://teams.igem.org/2783	Manufacturing	Current production of styrene, an important plastic monomer, is oil based. As an alternative to oil based styrene we aim to produce styrene from a presently underused wastestream: cellulosic waste. Our system consists of both breaking down cellulose to glucose and subsequent styrene production in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. First the cellulose is degraded by an established cellulosome complex containing different cellulases and a cellulose binding domain. By complexing the cellulases and anchoring the complex to the cell wall the efficiency of the cellulosome is enhanced synergistically. The freed glucose is taken up and used for growth and production of phenylalanine. Conversion of phenylalanine to styrene occurs in two steps, first the phenylalanine ammonia lyase enzyme (PAL2) is introduced, which enables the yeast to convert phenylalanine into trans-cinnamate. The final step of our cascade is catalyzed by a native enzyme, producing styrene from trans-cinnamate.

https://teams.igem.org/2785	Information Processing	The ability to measure and record molecular signals in a cell is critical. Current systems are limited in that they can only take a “snapshot” of the environment, preventing scientists from understanding event order. Previously systems have utilized a CRISPR/Cas9 base editor complex (BE), which can record information in DNA by producing permanent single nucleotide changes; however, recording capability was limited to logging an average concentration of stimuli over a period of time. Our system builds upon these foundations by designing a method of true chronological event recording. By introducing recording plasmids with repeating units of DNA and multiple gRNA to direct our base editor construct, we can achieve true temporal resolution of stimuli. Furthermore, we simplified the readout, so inexpensive laboratory equipment can be used. This technique will provide an understanding of the order in which molecules and proteins appear in systems, illuminating the hidden, casual relationships.

However, it is difficult for people in poor areas to continuously obtain protein rich foods. Therefore, in addition to these ingredients, we propose ‘Bacterial Supplement’ anyone can easily take it into the body. We got this idea from Papuans living in Papua New Guinea. Despite their low-protein diets, they have muscular bodies. It is thought that nitrogen fixing bacteria in their intestines are influencing on protein nutrition. We thought to construct a pathway to synthesize amino acids from nitrogen in E. coli, introducing it in the future. To synthesize amino acids, we first express nitrogenase to convert nitrogen to ammonia. We then express amino acid dehydrogenase to synthesize glutamate and phenylalanine from accumulated ammonia. We hope that our project will contribute to the solution of protein-energy malnutrition by fixing this E. coli in our intestinal flora.
https://teams.igem.org/2787	Foundational Advance	Input, controller, and output have been the standard procedure of engineered regulatory biocircuit. However, the precise input-to-output control may fail at times mainly due to (i) delayed responses from input signals to output signals, and (ii) unexpected interactions between the host and exogenous circuits. For example, previous iGEM projects primarily focused on the single time response of systems, which underestimated the fact that continuously changing inputs may cause the disorder of output signals. Therefore, a system needs to be constructed for rapidly responding to the changing input signals and eliminating the superposition between outputs from different input signals. In this context, we design a high-fidelity control system with a feedback loop and orthogonal ribosome, which allows the outputs to respond precisely to the changing input signals. We envision that our control system will offer the synthetic biology community a novel solution to manipulate uncertain input.
https://teams.igem.org/2788	Manufacturing	This year we designed a fungal cockroach terminator system based on Metarhizium anisopliae. It can infect cockroaches in a very high efficiency and eventually lead to death. Our system consists of three parts. First, we use a hydrophobic protein called HsbA. It can help our fungus attach better to the cockroaches. Second, we transferred Bbchit which encodes the chitinase that can penetrate the surface of the cockroaches. After our transgenic Metarhizium anisopliae enter the hemolymph of cockroach. The third gene we transferred called MCL1 will combine with the specific antigen on the surface of Metarhizium anisopliae , which makes our system 'invisible' and can avoid the detection of the immune system. This allows our transgenic Metarhizium anisopliae to reproduce themselves greatly and eventually lead to cockroach’s death. For better application we designed a device to contain our emulsifiable powder which we will definitely show you in giant jamboree.
https://teams.igem.org/2789	Environment	This year we aim to establish a brand new system of environmental remediation and maintenance in water. Owing to leakage or improper discharge, there are high levels of many chemicals in the water body causing water pollution like eutrophication. To deal with this, we established a set of pathways, used the symbiotic system of algae and our engineered bacteria and finally built an device as platform that can carry them—The Noah’s Ark. The Ark can make use of solar energy and continuously collect specific element or chemical agents from water to achieve the water restoration, as well as reusing the purified chemicals as resources！As an experiment, we used the Ark to recover phosphorus this year. Thus, the first product of a whole series was launched：Noah’s Ark I—Polyphosphate planet.
https://teams.igem.org/2790	Environment	Methane is a Greenhouse gas associated with Global Warming, and green methods are desired for its real-time monitoring. Thus, we have developed the prototype of a robust field-applicable methane biosensor, MethNote. We found an enzyme-complex methane monooxygenase(MMO) from Methylococcus capsulatus, a methanotrophic bacterium, that converts methane to methanol. We expressed soluble-MMO in the methylotrophic yeast, Pichia pastoris, which harbors a plasmid expressing the reporter gene under a methanol inducible promoter AOX. Thus, linking methane uptake to a reporter gene expression generates the proposed methane biosensor. The inclusion of sMMO pathway was also checked by metabolic modeling. The constructed part will be a useful contribution to the iGEM repository. A commercial design of MethNote will find widespread applications in environmental monitoring of methane. In future studies, we also anticipate an additional application of Mut- strain of P. pastoris expressing sMMO in biofuel production through methanol sequestration.
https://teams.igem.org/2791	Manufacturing	D-psicose, the C-3 epimer of fructose, is a natural rare sugar that is low in energy, which exerts several potential health benefits, including preventing diabetes development. Bioproduction of D-psicose shows promise but suffers severely from low enzyme activity. Directed evolution (DE) is an effective strategy for optimizing various enzymes. However, high throughput is never achieved when screening manually or using conventional methods such as HPLC to monitor metabolite concentration. To overcome such difficulties, we have constructed the Sensing, Coupling, Selecting and Iterating framework of DE with quantitative regulatory mechanisms underlying each step. D-psicose productivity is first converted into mRNA expression level, then couples with genes conveying survival advantages by tunable hairpin cassette. The procedure iterates itself in evolving more effective enzymes. This framework for DE could hopefully be applied to improve the functionality of other biomolecules, as long as a suitable biosensor for the final product exists.
https://teams.igem.org/2792	Open	Society demands a better understanding of its environment. We require information about our surroundings, from the traffic density to the temperature distribution in the city we live. Generating and interconnecting this big amount of data is what we call the Internet of Things (IoT). There is no standard way of taking biological measurements within the frame of traditional IoT (i.e. the concentration in the air of viruses, toxins, allergens, etc). It is due to the instability of the reactives, the complexity of automating the laboratory protocols and the need of highly sensitive devices. Additionally, the economic cost of biological devices is remarkably high in comparison to traditional IoT gadgets. And this feature is key, as it is mandatory to extract data from a huge number of nodes. Our project deals with this issue, bringing together microfluidics, aptamer-based sensors, an affordable electrochemical metrological system and a big ammount of love.

They can be used in blood transfusion and stroke treatment. We will first try to secrete human hemoglobin subunits and other required proteins for oxygen transport. Then we will focus on loading the protein cargo into the exosome, which we have chosen for the reason of immune-compatibility and easy production. The exosomes will be loaded endogenously with hemoglobin using membrane anchored proteins (CD63) or using exosome-forming pathways inside the cell (WW tag and Ndfip1). By doing this, we will produce an efficient method for future iGEM teams to create protein-loaded exosomes that can be used in therapeutics and develop a potential blood replacement.
https://teams.igem.org/2795	Environment	Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a polymer used to make plastic products ranging from synthetic fibers to water bottles. Large amounts of PET end up accumulating in the environment as pollution. A bacterium named Ideonella sakaiensis was found to degrade PET by using two enzymes, PETase and MHETase, to break PET into two monomers: ethylene glycol (EG) and terephthalic acid (TPA). However, I. sakaiensis’ inability to breakdown PET on a practical time scale undermines its usefulness in eliminating PET pollution. Our project aimed to tackle PET pollution by engineering a synthetic Escherichia coli and Aceintobacter baylyi co-culture to degrade and metabolize PET. Since both E. coli and A. baylyi are more characterized than I. sakaiensis and also capable of high-throughput mutagenesis, PET degradation and metabolism pathways in an engineered synthetic E. coli and A. baylyi co-culture potentially could be optimized to be more efficient than those natively found in I. sakaiensis.
https://teams.igem.org/2796	Therapeutics	Gastric cancer is one of the most popular digestive malignant carcinomas in the world. Exosomes are cell-derived nanovesicles and act as vesicles for delivering micromolecular like miRNA. Here, we turn HEK 293 T cells and MGC803 cells into a manufacturing factory, massively producing exosomes with our target miRNA in it,whose function is related to reduce the viability of tumor cells.The three miRNA is obtained by bioinformation analysis.To be continued, considering the heterogeneity of tumor cells, we use inducible promoter to active three miRNAs separately. By changing the inducers' concentration, we want to grope optimum functional concentration range of miRNAs. Finally, we hope that this system can be used in tumor infiltrating T cells. TIL is an inactive T lymphocyte in tumor tissue whose function is inhibited because of tumor microenvironment. If the TIL were armed with our controllable miRNAs, a new therapy for gastric cancer treatment would appeared.
https://teams.igem.org/2797	Environment	The demand for food, fuel and materials is placing unprecedented pressure on agricultural production. To secure higher productivity, the sector relies upon synthetic fertilisers derived from energy intensive manufacturing methods. Here, we propose an alternative approach to support plant productivity. The Alternative Roots project investigated Pseudomonas fluorescens as a chassis organism. Development of a plant-colonising chassis provides novel mechanisms for soil microbiome manipulation without genetically modified crops. As proof of concept, we focus on improving nitrogen supply via naringenin biosynthesis - a potential chemoattractant of free-living, nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Legal and social considerations of the project drove the development of NH-1, a low-cost, small-scale and programmable hydroponic system. Tailored to overcome experimental limitations faced by many plant scientists, NH-1 provides improved reproducibility, coupled with high-throughput experimentation. This system enabled exploration of future deployment techniques within contained environments that may result in enhanced, sustainable crop productivity at a local and accessible level.
https://teams.igem.org/2798	WIKI	In vivo circular RNA expression can be a cutting edge method to perform mass-production of protein. During the translation of coding information of DNA into amino acids, function of ribosomes is naturally influential. The translation is initiated by binding ribosomes to mRNA and termination of translation is induced by a stop codon. When a start codon is recognized by ribosomes, the protein producing organelles release the protein. To produce large amount of protein and long-chain protein we can utilize circular RNA without the stop codon. iGEM Gifu 2015 performed the method of the Permuted Intron-Exon Method (PIE method). Currently 2.5% of transcribed RNA can be formed as circular RNA. With PIE method, mass-production of protein was confirmed in E.coli, however the protein had no function because of aggregation. This year our team will try to produce functional protein from the circular RNA in PURE system, a kind of cell-free system.
https://teams.igem.org/2799	Manufacturing	Colonization of uninhabitable areas, like Mars, will require building materials to be transported to the site of deployment. Transport limitations such as space and weight make this process very expensive. Based on these challenges, we propose to make building materials from fungal mycelium to be grown on site. Therefore, our project is focused on how to optimize the material properties of the fungi through engineering of basic fungal characteristics. Our initial studies identified Aspergillus oryzae as the best candidate chassis for material properties and ease of genetic engineering. Based on this, we transformed the melA gene from Rhizobium etli into A. oryzae in an effort to improve the UV radiation tolerance by establishing melanin production. Furthermore, we have designed a final geometric structure that can withstand external conditions and reduce the amount of work needed to assemble it.

Additionally, significant amount of omics data has also been accumulated but not widely utilized yet. Zymomonas mobilis is a non-model Gram-negative ethanologenic bacterium with many desirable characteristics to favor the production of lignocellulosic biofuels. In this project, a reporter-gene system for Z. mobilis was established to effectively characterize genetic parts such as promoters and RBS. Moreover, promoter strength was systematically predicted based on omics datasets. These genetic parts including their compatibility were then characterized and further utilized for building an isobutanol-production module to convert campus waste paper cartons into renewable biofuels of ethanol and isobutanol. The success of our project will not only build up a reporter-gene system, basic and composite parts for the non-model species, but also provide renewable biofuels while protecting the campus environment.

https://teams.igem.org/2802	Environment	Plants secrete many chemicals in the soil around their roots. These exudates can act as molecular signals for microorganisms in the rhizosphere, which can in turn modulate gene expression. We wish to exploit this natural phenomenon to engineer microorganisms to sense and respond to plants. A synthetic symbiotic association that helps plants grow better and resist diseases will reduce dependence on artificial fertilizers and pesticides. Toward this end, we are studying changes in gene expression in the common soil bacterium, Bacillus subtilis, in response to root exudates of rice, wheat, tomato and soybean plants. As a case study, we are constructing a genetic amplifier using an exudate-inducible promoter to produce phosphatase, which will help solubilize organic phosphate present in the soil. This represents an advance toward smart soil management practices and sustainable agriculture.
https://teams.igem.org/2803	Environment	As a result of acid rain, levels of toxic aluminum are rising in Nova Scotia rivers. These aluminum levels correlate with dramatic declines in Atlantic Salmon populations. Measuring aluminum levels is expensive, making it difficult for community groups that protect rivers in Nova Scotia to track aluminum levels. To decrease this cost, we designed a sensitive and inexpensive biosensor to detect levels of toxic aluminum. Our team is making use of the natural product pyoverdine, a fluorescent compound that certain pseudomonads produce to scavenge iron. While the enzymes responsible for pyoverdine synthesis are known, it is not known what steps in the pyoverdine synthesis pathway may be rate-limiting. We are overexpressing pyoverdine enzymes to determine the rate-limiting step. We are developing a fluorescent aluminum biosensor, which could be used as a “point-of-care” diagnostic for at-risk rivers. This will enable targeting of mitigation strategies and better profiling of aluminum levels.

Bacterial cellulose is used as a bandage matrix. The fusion proteins have the following parts: CBD, ELP and BMP2. CBDs function is to bind to cellulose, the ELP protein gives greater flexibility to the bandage, while the BMP2 protein, an inducer of cell differentiation in osteoblasts, is responsible for reducing the recovery time of the bones. To achieve the objective, the expression of the cellulose and the fusion proteins is carried out separately. For bacterial cellulose, is used an Escherichia coli expression system, in two plasmids: psb1C3 responsible for cellulose synthesis and psb1A3 responsible for the synthesis of the export system and overproduction. For the fusion protein, is used plasmid psb1C3, which contain the genes for the proteins CBD, ELP and BMP2.
https://teams.igem.org/2805	WIKI	BostonU is characterizing and optimizing two light-inducible promoters, LOV2 and PhiReX, in S. cerevisiae to improve eukaryotic transcriptional control with applications in industrial fermentation. Light-inducible promoters lend greater spatiotemporal control over transcription than small molecule-inducible promoters. Further, LOV2 is activated by blue light and PhiReX by red light, allowing for multiplexed control. We characterize these systems using the eVOLVER, a novel automated cell culturing platform developed by Brandon Wong at Boston University’s Khalil Lab. The eVOLVER’s specificity and high throughput allows for unprecedented characterization across light pulse programs, temperature, and OD thresholds. We then apply LOV2 and PhiReX to the violacein pathway, demonstrating the induction of four distinctly-colored phenotypes in a single strain, providing a proof-of-concept for the multiplexed control and finely-tuned expression of genes required for effective control of metabolic flux via transcriptional regulation.
https://teams.igem.org/2806	Environment	Water pollution has become a rising problem in Lake Michigan as more contaminants are accidentally or illegally dumped. However, very little is being done to raise citizen awareness or to combat the negative effects on the ecosystem. Thus, the goal of this project is to create a paper-based cell-free assay that detects whether chromium or lead is present in a given water supply. Cell free systems are ideal for heavy metal detection because they are field-deplorable, eliminate issues of biocontamination, and facilitate increased reaction control via the open reaction environment. For each metal, there are two plasmids; one that produces a repressor protein while the other constitutively produces GFP. With this combination, the repressor interferes with the production of GFP until the specified heavy metal is present, resulting in a fluorescent output. The benefit of creating an easy-to-use sensor is that it empowers everyday citizens to test their water quality.
https://teams.igem.org/2807	Village	Since the discovery of the CRISPR-Cas9, researchers now have a tool for precise gene targeting in any living organism. However, there remain concerns about whether such DNA editing methods are ethical, specific and safe, especially if editing is carried out in somatic cells. Recent work has shown that another Cas family protein, Cas13, can target and degrade specific RNA transcripts, thus effectively silencing target gene expression. The targeting of RNA strands has many advantages over DNA, as any changes are not permanent and its effect is transient. Our project aims to extend the application of CRISPR-Cas13 guided RNA targeting system for editing specific RNA bases on RNA strand (RESCUE system). Cas13 is linked to the catalytic domain of APOBEC1, an enzyme that can carry out RNA base modification. Our RESCUE system can diversify the current repertoire of RNA editing methods available.

To address the worldwide challenge of FBDs, we have devised a customizable device for the simultaneous detection of multiple food-borne pathogens (FBPs). The device detects specific DNA sequences associated with four FBPs: Campylobacter, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella, and Vibrio cholerae using the isothermal amplification techniques: recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). The use of isothermal techniques allows the device to be more portable and cost-effective compared to conventional PCR systems, while the use of microfluidics allows for multiplexing and rapid high-throughput screening. The parameters of the device such as the number of pathogens, and amplification and detection methods can be customized as required. This novel lab-on-a-chip based device is rapid, portable, affordable, sensitive, specific, and customizable, making it ideal for resource-limited settings and point-of-care testing.

We were inspired by the water resistant nature of lignin, but natural lignin has many weaknesses. By taking advantage of an oxidizing enzyme produced by engineered Pichia pastoris, we can bind monolignols together into a simpler polymer. This polymer, which we named Liggreen, is water resistant like plastic but decomposable and also heat resistant. Liggreen in paper cups is just one of many applications, so the future of Liggreen is prosperous.
https://teams.igem.org/2810	WIKI	Aphids are crop pests globally. They feed on a massive diversity of crops and can cause tremendous economic loss for farmers by reducing crop yields and grain sizes. They damage crops directly by feeding on plant vasculature, draining essential compounds, or indirectly, as hosts of a variety of plant viruses. Current agricultural practice is to use chemical pesticides, which are unfavourable due to off-target effects, harmfulness to humans, and developing resistance of aphids. Consequently, our team has attempted to produce an effective RNAi pesticide against Myzus persicae, the most economically detrimental aphid pest worldwide. In the vasculature of Nicotiana benthamiana, we express siRNAs that affect aphid bacteriocytes, cells that enable the survival of their essential symbiont, Buchnera aphidicola. We target genes BCR3 and SP3 to do this. Finally, we expand the limited PhytoBrick registry, with several plant promoters and reporter genes.

Flip recombinase has been used to induce genetic mutations in vivo in numerous model organisms including bacteria, Drosophila, Zebrafish, and mouse and human cells. However, Flip recombinase activity is binary and thus cannot be precisely activated in time and space. Utilizing light sensitive protein interaction domains termed “magnets”, we have developed a light-sensitive optogenetic variant of Flip recombinase that can be controlled in Escherichia coli with exquisite spatio-temporal precision. We believe this Opto-Flip recombinase has the potential to be utilized in multiple model organisms, and will provide a novel tool allowing for precise molecular-genetic control for numerous future research and industrial applications.

A major obstacle for the use of Living Biomaterials outside the lab is bacterial leakage, presenting both a technical issue and a safety risk. Our project aims to address this issue. We have engineered a strain of E. Coli to anchor itself into a novel dextran hydrogel by expressing an adhesive protein derived from arctic ice-binding bacteria. This platform would enable innumerable applications. As a proof of concept, we have designed a patch for chronic wounds in which anchored E. coli would secrete antimicrobial peptides to fight infections and reduce the need for systemic antibiotics and daily change of wound dressing – a painful procedure for many patients.

However, CRISPR’s high frequency of off site targets can lead to undesired mutations, making it imperative that accuracy and efficiency be improved to be successful. Since modifications to minimize off-site targets are under development, it is important that there is a standardized model available on which these modifications and their binding patterns can be tested and compared. We designed a testing platform for comparing engineered Cas9 variants to the natural form through direct competition. Our model relies on competition between two Cas9s from Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus as a proof of concept in an assay termed “Guardian/Assassin”. This system can be used to expedite the design process of Cas9 systems and expand the Cas9 toolbox by allowing faster identification of efficiency within IGEM and throughout the scientific community.

Often biological systems are unable to provide sharp and accurate input to output response due to reasons like noise, growth factors etc. Hence there exists a need of robust and reliable modules that can transform the analog and stochastic behaviour of biology into a digital response. We aim to develop recombinase based elementary constructs that would allow development of complex circuits with specialized functions with greater ease. Recombinases are enzymes that trigger site-specific recombination to perform excision/incision or inversion of genetic circuits, to produce the desired gene expression. Our project involves use of serine based recombinases to develop a novel recombinase based toolkit of elementary circuits such as feedforward loop, feedback loop etc.

This anti-venom ability is gained through a single protein; the Lethal Toxin Neutralizing Factor (LTNF). We are attempting to produce an improved version of this anti-venom, LTNF 2.0 if you will, as a synthetic anti-venom for human use. LTNF 2.0 incorporates the post-translational modification process known as circularization, a process that comprises of adding cysteine amino acids to both ends of a polypeptide chain; triggering the formation of a disulphide bridge, ultimately leading to a circular structure, hence the name circularization. Circularized proteins are known for not only greater stability but also greater efficacy of the protein, thereby improving its shelf life and lowering the required dosage for treatment, ultimately providing a more efficient bioproduct.

Our project is to use miRNA——miRNA155 and miRNA10b——in human serum as biomarkers to detect early forms of breast cancer. Toehold switches are used for the detection and the product can be suited to any other early cancer detections if the trigger part is changed to bind with other miRNA sequences. When both kinds of miRNAs are binded,our artificial designed biological system will produce green fluorescent protein.Based on it,we can detect fluorescence and calculate microRNA expression level.We're trying to make our project become a convenient and cheap disease-detecting method in people's daily life.

To relieve the intestinal inflammation, we empowered our bacteria with an anti-inflammatory device, which includes a sensor to detect the inflammatory signal, a highly efficient enhancer and an effector to secrete interleukin ten (IL-10). Furthermore, we engineered our bacteria with myrosinase to turn the glucosinolates, a natural component of cruciferous vegetables, to sulphoraphane. It’s an organic molecule with well-known anti-cancer activity. Integrating cruciferous vegetable diet with synthetic biology, we envision that the engineered bacteria will greatly help us to overcome the severe situation in the IBD patient’s gut.
https://teams.igem.org/2818	Foundational Advance	Recently, different CRISPR/Cas systems have been engineered to perform base editing on both DNA and RNA. However, some critical shortcomings are hampering their applications. For example, these base editors are often too large to fit into common delivery vehicles. Additionally, no approach is available to enable fast screening of specific RNA modifications. To tackle the size issue, we developed novel compact Cas9 protein scaffolds that, when fused to deaminase domains, will be both small enough to fit into delivery vehicles and only exhibit sufficient editing activity for downstream therapeutic applications. With our human practice, similar efforts were made on analogous RNA modifications using the Cas13 protein family. To tackle the second issue, we aimed to directly detect nucleotide modifications in the transcriptome using nanopore sequencing. We synthesised and sequenced unmodified and modified RNAs with the nanopore sequencer to develop different machine learning models that reliably identify positions of base modifications.

Traditional production of natural dyes from plants heavily exhausts land and labour. While bio-manufacturing is an attractive alternative, it remains costly and chemically-intensive. We aim to develop a new bio-manufacturing method of producing flavonoids in E. coli for use as natural dyes. To eliminate the use of expensive chemical inducers to switch from growth to production phase and allow dynamic gene regulation, we designed an optogenetic circuit using a blue light repressible promoter for flavonoid biosynthesis. As it is critical to monitor cellular metabolic burden for efficient production, we introduced a stress-sensing fluorescence reporter. To optimize operations, a computer-aided system was developed to regulate gene expression using light according to the feedback from the stress sensor. To demonstrate this approach, we produced Luteolin, a natural yellow dye.

Our definition of the state of cells suspended animation is state of hypometabolism followed by ATP depression, and then returned to the original state. H₂S is believed to be involved in this suspended animation process at the individual level. The objective of our project is to let the E.coli respond to the signal of the cell, and secrete the necessary amount of H₂S synthase (CTH) for the state of suspended animation to lower the metabolism. The secretion of CTH is regulated by RhlR . When the cells to be preserved become the state of suspended animation, the secretion of CTH from E.coli will stop, and most of the E.coli will also be suicided.

Therefore, it is important to detect the concentration of L-lactate. Acid-base titration is a common method for it, but this method is complicated and time-consuming. In order to monitor L-lactate quickly and conveniently, we designed a biosensor for detecting L-lactate concentration by using the lldPRD L-lactate operon and QS system in E. coli. One of these parts is able to induce the lldPRD genes expression, LuxS protein, in the presence of L-lactate. LuxS protein catalyzes the SAM cycle and produces a small signaling molecule AI-2 that motivates our second part promoter of LsrA&K to promote GFP expression. The optic fiber is able to detect the GFP signal and convert it into current. Simultaneously, the entire device container will be made by 3D printing.

PETNET uses several advances to address this issue. The recently discovered PETase from Ideonella sakaiensis is attached to a cellulose binding domain to increase PET degrading potential. The degrading efficiency of this protein is amplified with the integrated hardware featuring a cellulose-lined, modular flow reactor. The enzymatic activity of PETase is accelerated when immobilized near flowing PET substrate via interaction of linked CBD with the reactor’s cellulose scaffold, allowing for feasible real-time PET degradation. Quantitation of PET degradation is accomplished with an evolved protocatechuate biosensor sensitive to micromolar concentrations of PET degradation byproduct. This approach circumvents the need for expensive instrumentation for the downstream detection of PET degradation. PETNET is a comprehensive approach to PET degradation that will offer a scalable platform for society to address the overwhelming accumulation of plastic.

In this study, we developed an engineered E. coli-based system to sensitively detect the copper concentration in industrial waste using synthetic biological methods. Meanwhile, we are trying to introduce a new gene to effectively capture copper ions in environment. If successful, this constructed biosystem could not only detect copper ions, but also enrich heavy metal pollutants (copper), form copper deposits and then purify the environment, which is portable, low-cost and environment-friendly.
https://teams.igem.org/2827	High School	Tobacco consumption is one of the leading preventable causes of death and disease in the world. Nicotine, a major toxic component of tobacco, can cross biological membranes and the blood-brain barrier easily. During cigarette manufacturing, large quantities of tobacco waste with high concentrations of nicotine are produced, and the disposal of these wastes is a serious ecological problem. Microbial organisms play important roles in the tobacco manufacturing process by altering the content of nicotine. Some strains of Pseudomonas exhibits high nicotine-degrading activity, which has a gene cluster encoded enzymes involved in the catabolism of nicotine. In this project, we are aiming to explore a better way to nicotine detection and degradation. The Escherichia coli strains was constructed to easily detect the concentration of nicotine using synthetic biological methods. Meanwhile, over-expressing the key enzyme genes for nicotine bioremediation is also in progress.
https://teams.igem.org/2828	Energy	We are exploring symbiotic co-culture of Lactococcus lactis, a lactic acid bacteria (LAB), and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, brewer’s yeast, as a means to naturally produce lactic acid. This precursor is valuable for the synthesis of poly-lactic acid, a widely used biodegradable plastic. In many food and beverage industries, LAB is a common contaminant of yeast. This suggests that yeast and LAB form a complex microbiome where both species act in symbiosis. Studying the symbiotic relationship between yeast and LAB could increase carbon flux to the production of lactic acid. Co-culture dynamics have not been thoroughly studied, as a result, we obtained bacterial and yeast fluorescence reporter strains and performed a systematic analysis of co-culture dynamics, including optimization of media characteristics and ratios of initial cell numbers. We concluded the ideal co-culture media is a mixture of 1X YPD and 1X M17 media supplemented with 2% glucose.

https://teams.igem.org/2830	High School	Outer Membrane Vesicles(OMVs) are a ubiquitous type of vehicles that continuously bud off from gram-negative bacteria’s outer membrane, serving as a communicative tool between bacteria. As natural kins to the bacterial membrane, they can preserve the integrity and bioactivity of sensitive Cas9 proteins and single guide RNA (sg-RNA) within, when used as a delivery tool. Our project aims to construct a system that uses OMVs as vectors for transporting the Cas9 protein and sgRNA into the host cells to achieve efficient muting of the virulent gene of interest in its genome. We expressed Cas9 and sgRNA together with a signal peptide enabling them to reach the bacteria’s periplasm to be encapsulated by OMVs. We expect this technique would reveal more flexible approaches in both in vitro and in vivo genetic engineering, thus enlarging the armamentarium of Synthetic Biology.
https://teams.igem.org/2831	High School	Huntington's Disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant disorder that leads to the progressive degeneration of neurons in the brain, which currently has no cure. HD is typically adult-onset and is characterized by a variety of symptoms including memory loss, involuntary movements, poor coordination, and impaired decision-making. Mutation in the huntingtin (HTT) gene causes HD, specifically a trinucleotide repeat of CAG that is abnormally repeated over 40 times. The goal of our project was to test the effectiveness of the plasmid that we generated last year, which targets and blocks endogenous faulty mRNA and releases a corrected RNA strand for proper protein synthesis of the HTT gene. The efficacy of this plasmid was tested on huntingtin cell lines, specifically the HeLa/polyQ-mCFP cell line. The effectiveness of this treatment was tested by evaluating whether the quantity of mutated HTT protein decreases after transfecting cells with the engineered plasmid.
https://teams.igem.org/2832	Foundational Advance	QUESTION: Can sound be used to induce gene expression in E. coli? IMPACT: It is routine to use a small molecule to induce gene expression in cells. Can sound become a routine means to induce gene expression? The Human Practices Team revealed that success in using sound to induce gene expression in cells has the potential to impact the brewing industry and molecular biology research. A potential negative impact could be the activation of pathogenic cells with sound guns. RESULTS: We characterized promoters submitted by the 2008 UC Berkeley team that potentially could be activated by sound. In parallel, we selected additional promoters that also have the potential to be induced by sound. We tested the promoters in new genetic devices to evaluate if different sound frequencies and amplitudes correlated with increased gene expression. The results of the tests are available on the wiki and will be presented.
https://teams.igem.org/2833	High School	Previous work have shown that the expression of bacterial Vitreoscilla hemoglobin (VHb) can help bacteria utilize oxygen more efficiently. However, the bacterial cell membrane makes eﬃcient hemoglobin-oxygen contact a challenge. Based on this, our team designed a VHb surface display system to express VHb on the outermost shell of the bacteria to raise the hemoglobin-oxygen contacting efficiency. Consequently，this could help bacteria tolerate the low oxygen environment better. We named this system OxygenMAX system. Basically, our OxygenMAX system can be applied to industrial fermentation to raise the high-cell-density growth of the engineering bacteria in bioreactors. Also, allowing for the better growth ability of the OxygenMAX system carried bacteria, our system can help avoid contamination with miscellaneous bacteria in industrial fermentation. Moreover, our OxygenMAX system can be applied to other low-oxygen engineering bacteria working condition like biosensor in intestinal tract, water or soil.
https://teams.igem.org/2834	Food & Nutrition	American and European Foulbrood are diseases that affect bee (Apis mellifera) larvae worldwide. In the last two years, 53 countries suffered from these diseases, 6 of them are among the top 10 honey producers. The causal agents of these ailments are gram-positive bacteria: Paenibacillus larvae and Melissococcus plutonius respectively. Nowadays, two techniques for the treatment of Foulbrood are used: antibiotics and incineration of hives. The former promotes the development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria while the latter results unprofitable for beekeepers. Therefore, we propose the production of bee antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) in Escherichia coli to treat P. larvae and M. plutonius infections. Defensin 1, abaecin, defensin 2, and apidaecin are each expressed in a different BL21 (DE3) culture. PelB leader peptide and a 6X His-tag foster adequate expression and further purification. Through mathematical modeling, the diffusivity of PLGA-nanoencapsulated apidaecin is evaluated for future in vivo delivery in the bee system.
https://teams.igem.org/2835	Environment	Antibiotics are among the most impactful polluters of water resources. Their presence negatively affects the environment due to ecotoxicity and potential contribution to antibiotic resistance. Sulfamethoxazole (SMX) is among the most prevalent and persistent antibiotics in the Baltic Sea. We want to tackle this problem by harnessing the oxidative power of a laccase originating from Trametes versicolor. This enzyme has the capacity to oxidize a wide range of aromatic compounds. We aim to express this laccase in Pichia pastoris and engineer its ability to inactivate SMX using advanced in silico rational design methods. Enzyme activity, SMX removal and toxicity assays were performed for analysis. In our final product, the laccase will be immobilised on magnetic beads, creating a reusable recovery system powered with magnetism. It can be implemented at wastewater treatment facilities or at entering points of the sewage system in hospitals, elderly homes and houses.
https://teams.igem.org/2836	High School	With electricity consumption increasing across the globe, the conservation of energy has become a topic of major concern. Our team has devised an innovative solution to reduce electricity usage by attempting to create genetically modified bioluminescent plants. By altering particles on the microscopic level, we hope to create plants that can glow and thus replace electricity in the future. To these ends, our team conducted experiments to transfer the lux operon, a cluster of genes (LuxCDABEG) that control bioluminescence in the bacterial species Aliivibrio fischeri, to plant species like Nicotiana tabacum. We also attempted to insert an extra copy of LuxG to enhance the effects of bioluminescence. The results are promising and point to the possibility of creating a greener alternative to current lighting. Furthermore, we will design a new plasmid that can detect potential stress factors like ethanol and report the signal with stronger bioluminescence.
https://teams.igem.org/2837	WIKI	Taxol is a natural molecule found in the bark of the Pacific Yew tree that has been used to treat a variety of cancers. Current manufacturing methods are unable to achieve high yields; the aim of our project is to greatly improve manufacturing outputs and reduce costs through biosynthesis of taxol from an intermediate in the synthesis pathway in E. coli. We used a modular approach to link the five necessary genes together before recombineering the construct into the E. coli genome; our design thus can be easily adapted to produce next generation taxanes. Five T7 bacteriophage promoters of varying strengths were selected from a promoter library and fitted in random combinations to the pathway genes. The resulting variants were screened to determine which combination of promoters maximized taxol synthesis. Finally, we analyzed the activity of produced taxol and evaluated this biosynthesis design’s feasibility in industrially relevant conditions.
https://teams.igem.org/2838	Manufacturing	Artificial bio-sensors based on the mammalian olfactory system are potentially powerful chemical analytical systems for many industrial, medical and security applications. The ability to express mammalian proteins make bacteria a potentially powerful platform for developing artificial chemical biosensors. Bacteria, however, lack several of the intracellular signaling proteins required to alter cell membrane field potential changes in response to odorant binding. To overcome this challenge, we have developed a plasmid containing a synthetic bacterial operon that enables the expression of multiple genes under the control of the upstream regulatory promoter for the AraC gene. In this proof-of-principle system, synthetic operon will be expressed in E.coli with a separate plasmid that co-expresses a human odorant receptor protein. These studies will provide the foundation for future work to develop synthetic operons can be used to heterologously express the multiple proteins required to develop bacterial chemical biosensors based on the mammalian olfactory system.
https://teams.igem.org/2839	Foundational Advance	Biological systems are unpredictable, noisy and difficult to maintain stable even under standardized conditions, thus making controlled gene expression difficult. Combined with the fickleness and stochasticity associated with genetic circuitry, fluctuations in the production rate of a desired protein are inevitable. Through model-driven design, we engineer systems which guarantee constant gene expression, decoupled from gene/plasmid copy number, that can be induced to meet the desired expression level. We implement a Type I incoherent feedforward loop in E. coli cells to stabilize promoters using TAL Effectors, CRISPRi and cis-acting sRNA repressors that regulate a downstream attenuator. Furthermore, to render our system versatile, we introduce a theophylline riboswitch that allows on-the-fly control of stabilized protein production. We provide a foundational advance tool that enables fine tuning of complex metabolic pathways, functionality improvement of logic gates and suppression of fluctuations in gene expression.
https://teams.igem.org/2840	High School	Our project is to make a new biological mosquito killer to kill mosquitoes in an environmentally friendly way. Mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue and Zika are prevailing around the world and causing death of a great number of people every year. Therefore, controlling mosquitoes is of great importance. There are two active components in our product: protein Cry11Aa and recombinant Aedes aegypti densoviruses. Protein Cry11Aa is solubilized in mosquito mid-gut and can lead to cell lysis when binding the receptor on cell membrane. The recombinant Aedes aegypti densoviruses can express insect-specific toxin, which kill mosquito by to affect insect neuronal sodium conductance. We mix them together to make effective and environmental mosquito killer. The new mosquito killer shows a high specificity for mosquitoes as a host. It is relatively stable in the environment and have the potential to spread and persist in mosquito populations.

Organic: Toxic oestrogen concentrations induce sex reversal in fish; the inability for breeding due to lack of males results in population decline. We have artificially tweaked and transferred a recently discovered enzyme pathway into E.Coli which reduces oestrogen toxicity. Inorganic: Lead contamination is responsible for serious health problems. We have designed a system through which lead can be isolated and removed via gas vesicles in Bacillus.
https://teams.igem.org/2842	Manufacturing	Revolutions in synthetic biology are driven by effective and universal standardisations, which the biomaterial industry has not had… yet. Inspired by the idea of engineering modularity, we investigated an innovative technology that allows for more efficient and high-throughput manufacturing of environmentally-friendly biomaterials. We devised a plug-and-play framework using intein splicing to aid in both the polymerisation and functionalisation of biomaterials with a range of applications. Due to its durability, biodegradability, and kevlar-like strength, we opted for spider silk as a model to test our proposed system. While developing our platform, we conceived a BioBrick-compatible standard with improved flexibility that enables the integration of conventional cloning methods into iGEM’s workflow. Our split-intein system provides the manufacturing industry a modular and accessible polymerisation approach that can foster the next generation of biomaterials.
https://teams.igem.org/2843	Village	Fluoride, in appropriate quantities, has been recognized as beneficial for protecting tooth enamel from decay. However, a significant problem arises when excess amounts of fluoride infiltrate drinking water. High fluoride concentrations can result in dental fluorosis, which is characterized in children by hypomineralization of the enamel. To address this challenge by efficiently detecting fluoride in water, we aim to develop a fluoride biosensor using previously characterized fluoride riboswitches. Last year, we have developed an operon that, when fluoride binds, activates the riboswitch resulting in transcription of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene. Thus, when fluoride is present, bacterial growth can be observed in the presence of chloramphenicol. However, this system was only able to detect high fluoride concentrations. To improve the efficacy and reduce the detection threshold, we used restriction enzymes to test various promoters and riboswitch sequences. We found that two of the new sequences promoted higher bacterial growth.

An mCherry fluorophore was fused to binding proteins for each of the following components of biofilms: the polysaccharides alginate and Psl (major components of the biofilms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa), cellulose, and double stranded RNA. Studies were carried out to determine which of these most accurately predicted the presence or absence of biofilms as compared with the results of traditional detection methods.
https://teams.igem.org/2845	New Application	Cell-based biosensors allow to simply and selectively sense diverse chemical signals; yet their applications are limited by the minutes-to-hours timescale of gene transcription and translation. To generate a real-time output, we exploit the much faster changes in protein interaction and bacterial movement. Based on the E. coli Tar chemotaxis receptor, we developed two sensing systems: detecting DNA binding of a transcription factor via split luciferase complementation, and imaging the movement of bacteria at the single-cell level. The sensory domain of Tar can be modified to recognize different molecules, extending the applicability of the sensor. To show the advances brought by our system we built AROMA, an autonomous robot that is directly driven by the onboard biosensor. The robot detects the concentration of volatile compounds in air by imaging the bacterial response with a microscope built in-house. This enables our device to locate the source of pollutants or chemical hazards.
https://teams.igem.org/2846	Diagnostics	Improved characterization of the cas13a protein provides the opportunity to build a cheap, rapid non-technical diagnostic tool that has point-of-care applications in resource-poor settings through the use of an Escherichia coli ­based transcription-translation (TX-TL) cell-free expression system. This self-contained platform encodes all components for diagnosis from detection to a readout in a cell-free solution. By combining the collateral cleavage of CRISPR-cas13a and small molecule sensing via metal sensitive operons, this system becomes modular, allowing for multiple diagnostic targets. To demonstrate, gene fragments of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were detected through the creation of specific targeting guide RNAs. CRISPR-cas13a’s collateral cleavage and its preferential cleaving towards certain motifs allowed for the development of a ratiometric read-out due to the preferential degradation of chromoprotein expressing mRNA. The diagnostic system provides a simple in vitro platform that can be used for the versatile detection of pathogenic bacteria in clinical or field settings.
https://teams.igem.org/2847	Diagnostics	We aim to create a CRISPR-based DNA diagnostics system that could be used for the detection of the most frequent mutations leading to cystic fibrosis. This genetic condition is considered to be the most common rare disease in Bulgaria. In most cases, the patient is initially misdiagnosed when sweat chloride level is used as an indicator. Our system relies on CRISPR’s ability to recognize specific sequences. We plan on using different read-outs, our first idea being site-specific DNA cleavage if a cystic fibrosis associated mutation is present. Another approach would be a pair of dCas9 proteins, linked to split halves of a reporter molecule that restores its activity if the target sequence is identified. Not only could our system be applied in big healthcare facilities, but also in many small town hospitals, since it does not require expensive and sophisticated equipment, for instance DNA sequencing devices.
https://teams.igem.org/2848	Manufacturing	To stop the spreading of germs in public places is an issue everyone can agree on its usefulness. Our team aims to produce an antimicrobial surface coating which tackles this problem. This coating, called “The Anti Germ Coating”, TAGC, consists of a chitosan matrix, coupled with rhamnolipid and nisin. All of these substances have shown antimicrobial properties in previous studies. During the iGEM competition we produced two BioBricks until this day, one for nisin-production and one for chitosan production. A third BioBrick, which should enable rhamnolipid production is currently under construction. Two approaches of coupling are used to generate our coating. The first method uses a surface-accessible tyrosine to couple a modified nisin to chitosan enzymatically. Chemical linkage of rhamnolipid is achieved by using divinyl adipate, which acts as a cross-linker. Antimicrobial properties of the coating are currently investigated. First results seem to be very promising.

The main products from the palm plant, palm oil and palm kernel oil, are not dispensable in today´s society. Because of their characteristic properties, they are widely used in food-, material-, beauty- and fuel industry. Palm kernel oil mainly consists out of saturated fatty acids, with Lauric acid (C12) as main component. This unique lipid pattern mainly differs from the palm oil itself. The aim of our project: We are working on a way to produce palm kernel oil using microorganisms, especially E.coli.The production of fatty acids and their esterification to triglycerides as energy storage is a natural process in all organisms. We make use of this natural way of synthesis by modifying the expression of fatty acids with appropriate carbohydrate chain length on a molecular level.

However, only a few tools are available for its gene manipulation. This year, we plan to expand the toolkit for A. baylyi ADP1 by making a synthetic promoter library along with codon optimized fluorescent reporter proteins to achieve better control over its expression rates. The codon table is not available for this organism. So we obtained sequence data of well-characterised proteins of this organism by filtering manually putative and hypothetical sequences and used this data to generate the codon table using CUTE - a tool of ChassiDex. The codon optimisation is done manually by replacing the less frequent codons with high-frequency codons based on the generated table. This can potentially open up various new exciting synthetic biology opportunities with this unexplored organism.

https://teams.igem.org/2859	High School	Type 1 and 2 Diabetes mellitus (T1DM, T2DM) are caused by inappropriate insulin production. The former results from the lack of ß cell, while the later results from insulin resistance. In order to treat T1DM as well as severe cases of T2DM, patients should be injected with insulin analog multiple times a day. Because these analogues are readily degraded upon oral intake, the only method of injecting insulin analog is via invasive methods. We aimed to develop minicell-based insulin delivery system that can be orally administered. Minicells are achromosomal cells that do not reproduce. Overexpression of FtsZ gene in Escherichia coli induces abnormal cell division that produces minicells. Through gibson assembly, we have engineered the minicell that produce single chain insulin associated with cell penetrating peptide that facilitates cellular intake. The cells lyses in response to bile salt, which leads to targeted secretion of insulin in intestine.

Harvesting crabs for this purpose has endangered this 350 million-year-old species. The first step in the cascade that characterizes the LAL test is activation of the protease Factor C by contact with endotoxins. We have devised a replacement for the LAL test using cloned Factor C and an artificial substrate consisting of a reporter fused to cellulose binding domain with the Factor C protease site connecting them. The substrate is bound to paper by the cellulose binding domain. When exposed to Factor C mixed with the injectable liquid formulation to be tested, the presence of endotoxins will activate the protease and the substrate will be cleaved, releasing the reporter. Our aim is to develop the most cost-effective and simple device possible so that it can be used by everyone.

Current biological control systems fail to provide the reversible and programmable spatiotemporal control of electrical systems used in industry. Electrogenetics is an emerging field of synthetic biology investigating electronic detection and control of gene expression. Presented here is the development of the first aerobic electrogenetic control system in E. coli. It functions through altering transcriptional activation of the SoxR/PsoxS redox-signalling system by controlling the oxidation of redox-mediators using an electrode. The potential of this system for precise spatial control is demonstrated using an affordable, custom electrode array to induce pattern formation in a lawn of cells.

We designed a targeting device, CaRTIN (Cardiomyocyte RyR2 Targeting Intra-Nanobody), to implement RyR2-specific inhibition of phosphorylation. Here, one of the isolated RyR2 nanobodies, AR185, inhibiting RyR2 phosphorylation in an in vitro assay was then chosen for further investigation. We investigated the potential of adeno-associated virus (AAV)-9-mediated cardiac expression of AR185 to combat post-ischemic heart failure. Adeno-associated viral gene delivery elevated AR185 protein expression in rat heart, and this administration normalized the contractile dysfunction of the failing myocardium in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, CaRTIN therapy to failing cardiomyocytes reduced sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ leak, restoring the diminished intracellular Ca2+ transients and Ca2+ load and reversed the phosphorylation of RyR2. To achieve controlled intra-nanobody release, a BNP promoter based platform was also accessed. Our results established a role of CaRTIN as a promising therapeutic approach for heart failure.

https://teams.igem.org/2869	Environment	Our project aims to develop mammalian-based biosensors for use in the context of environmental toxicology. Specifically, out biosensors have been designed to co-opt the mammalian cell’s intrinsic stress response pathways and use these to trigger the production of a fluorescent reporter. We hypothesize that a device reporting on the activation of cell stress pathways will provide more physiologically and health-relevant information about the potential toxins present in an environment than bioassays which seek to simply measure the compound presence and/or abundance. That is, our bioassay asks not whether a compound is there, but rather whether compounds exist that may pose a health hazard. Our biosensors use mammalian-derived promoters of genes known to be activated in response to stress-inducing environmental pollutants. These promoters are coupled to a reporter gene (eGFP) and used in in vitro assays to report on the presence of compounds that elicit cell stress.

PharMARSy will develop a novel portable system that combines protein production and purification in a single step. To achieve this, we will hijack the bacterial type-3-secretion system (T3SS) that injects signal-tagged proteins through cell membranes. By constructing a device with two chambers separated by a membrane we direct our T3SS-bearing bacteria to inject target-proteins through the membrane and into a collection chamber. This method will separate the pure recombinant protein from the producing organism, facilitating purification. We will establish proof-of-concept using membranes in the form of liposomes, lipid-bilayers, onion cells and egg yolk. Furthermore, the two-chambered device will be 3D-printed.

https://teams.igem.org/2872	WIKI	Our approach overcomes the limitations of sequencing, it being a cost-ineffective, labour-intensive, and location-specific method. Utilizing CRISPR for purposes other than gene editing has allowed us to create a novel, field-ready, diagnostic technique for carriers of recessive traits. Cas12a proteins are DNA targeting enzymes that recognize DNA based on a guide RNA sequence designed to match a target. The binding initiates non-specific single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) cleavage activity in Cas12a sufficient to degrade linear and circular ssDNA within minutes. Through this, ssDNA attached to fluorescent dye and quencher, serving as reporters, will undergo degradation. Upon cleavage, the quencher is released and fluorescence is emitted. We designed, built and programmed a hand-held device that can detect the fluorescence with high sensitivity. Simply, DNA obtained from cheek swabs, inserted into the device, diagnoses carriers of Sickle Cell Anemia.

Cell proliferation will remain normal with the presence of mercury(II) and the auxotrophic attribute by mercury(II) concentration, at which become nonviable. This is achieved by inserting an plasmid vector into an existing auxotroph E. coli (strain JW3841-1), which has its GlnA gene (Glutamine synthetase) knocked out, leads to its inability to synthesize glutamine and constrains the E. coli's proliferation. MerR is a mercury(II)-dependent transcriptional repressor-activator based on mercury(II) concentration. When mercury(II) is present, it activates the transcription of the mercury resistance protein complex and represses when absent. GlnA, MerR and MerA gene will be implanted into strain JW3841-1. MerR is activated by environmental mercury(II), glutamine synthetase will be produced for cell utilization. When the environmental mercury(II) is fully converted into mercury(0) by MerA (Reductase), the translation of glutamine synthetase will stop, which lead to bacterial death.

Our project is concerned with developing a synthetic pathway in E.coli for extracellular expression of enzyme alkyl-sulfatase originally found in bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa to degrade SDS into commercially viable 1-dodecanol.

To detect the miRNA with high specificity and amplification, our team proposed a system in which a complimentary toehold RNA would be created upstream of the RNA sequence for cas13a, a modified version of cas9 which would cut RNA randomly, triggering a fluorescent signal amplification when in the presence of RNAse detection kits.
https://teams.igem.org/2876	New Application	Two-hybrid systems are a well-established tool for screening protein-protein interactions in yeast and bacteria; however, there is little precedent of using these systems for detection. By swapping bait and target proteins for single-chain antibodies and dCas9, we have adapted a bacterial two-hybrid system as a modular E. coli-based detection platform for small molecules, proteins, and DNA. While most whole-cell detection methods indicate the target molecule’s presence by activating a visible reporter, our system initiates transcription of a downstream gene. This allows us to activate gene expression in response to a specific signal, effectively turning any DNA sequence, small molecule, or protein into a potential transcription factor. This holds tremendous promise as a safety mechanism for engineered bacterial strains: if an undesirable mutation or molecular product is detected within a cell, our system can kill the cell by activating an apoptotic gene, or express a fluorescent protein for live-cell sorting.
https://teams.igem.org/2877	High School	HIV diagnosis of infants in the developing world continues to pose many problems as current diagnostic methods are inaccurate in infants and difficult to administer in the field. Recent research demonstrates CRISPR-associated enzyme Cas12a’s ability to indiscriminately cleave ssDNA following recognition and cleavage of a dsDNA target strand, lending itself to nucleotide detection assays. Due to their high stability in cells, Cas enzymes such as Cas12a are prime candidates for lyophilized bacterial reagents (“cellular reagents”) that can be stored at room temperature until resuspended for later use in the field. Our project aims to design an innovative HIV1 diagnostic system for infants that combines cellular reagents with a Cas12a assay. For the purposes of iGEM and biosafety, our team focused on demonstrating the following with purified enzymes and cellular reagents: isothermal amplification of viral DNA and detection of viral DNA by a Cas12a assay.
https://teams.igem.org/2878	High School	Phyllotreta striolata is one of the most destructive insects worldwide. However, the present insect control strategies have certain limitations, for example, chemical insecticide applications will cause dietary pollution and environmental destruction. Here, we aim to develop an RNAi-based approach for controlling P. striolata. This approach is to topically apply exogenous siRNAs/shRNAs onto vegetables, ingestion of the sprayed siRNAs or shRNAs by P. striolata will induce the RNAi mechanism in the insect and lead to its death. In our project, siRNAs/shRNAs were designed based on the mRNA sequences of their target genes. The effect of both siRNAs and shRNAs in mediating RNAi in P. striolata were examined. Experimental results show that both siRNAs and shRNA could successfully silence their target genes, which was demonstrated by the survival rate decrease after siRNA or shRNA treatment. Our project provides an environmentally friendly approach for insect control.
https://teams.igem.org/2879	Diagnostics	In our iGEM Project we will design a personalized gluten sensor through a synthetic biology approach. To do so, we will build a model based on the HLA expression of the patient which will be coupled to a sensor, allowing the detection of reactive epitopes. Our sensor: a) Will be built according to the patient HLA, allowing the detection of specific reactive epitopes independently of the food source. b) Will be able to detect reactive epitopes even in fermented foods. c) The methodology implemented in our sensor could be used for the identification of new reactive epitopes and unknown allelic variants. d) Requires only a DNA sample of the patient. Therefore, the methodology and application of our sensor could be extended for the detection of other HLA related disorders as well as the generation of new research lines for the diagnosis, detection and basic knowledge of these type of disorders.
https://teams.igem.org/2880	Environment	Heavy metal contamination at current and former mining sites is a significant environmental and human health problem. Cadmium (Cd) is one of the more commonly found metal contaminants and due to the highly toxic nature, even minute amounts can cause loss of function of the kidney and liver and loss of bone. We developed a rapid and efficient cadmium sensing and binding system that is capable of detecting cadmium down to 10 μM concentrations. When exposed to a minimum concentration of Cd, the cell expresses the green fluorescent protein (GFP). After Cd is detected, a metallothionein protein binds it and sequesters it in the periplasmic space in the E. coli cell. We will present data characterizing the performance of this system. The engineered system can be used for remediation efforts to remove Cd from the environment and process it safely.
https://teams.igem.org/2881	Diagnostics	In order to address key bottlenecks in liquid biopsy and noninvasive cancer detection techniques, our team focused on using epigenetic determinants for diagnostic purposes. Presented here is a novel workflow for diagnosing cancer by using promoter methylation as an indicator of interest. Key promoter regions of interest are first identified via unsupervised machine learning applied to the Cancer Genome Atlas via our in silico predictive tool. After this, our specially-designed assay can detect the presence of these hypermethylated regions of interest and provide a quantitative, fluorescent readout in order to generate clinical insight. Special advances in material science and microfluidics are then used to enhance the sensitivity and specificity of our assay. The workflow is then completed via integration into a smartphone application that provides the necessary data and helps streamline doctor-patient communication. Our proof of concept was centered around hepatocellular carcinoma.

https://teams.igem.org/2885	High School	The goal of this project is to construct a novel fusion protein of gold binding polypeptides (GBP)-protein G (ProG) to develop an electrochemical biosensor for rapid and simple diagnosis and monitoring heart failure. DH5-alpha E. coli strain was transformed by a genetically modified recombinant vector coding GBP and ProG. The GBP-ProG fusion protein was derived from the strain with IPTG-induced expression and purified using the TALON metal affinity resin. The resulting GBP-ProG was directly self-immobilized onto gold surfaces via the GBP portion, followed by the oriented binding of antibodies onto the ProG domain targeting the Fc region of antibodies. An electrochemical immunochip was fabricated through the GBP-ProG and gold patterned interdigitated array electrode. Antibody immobilization onto the gold surface of the electrode by the GBP-ProG was rapidly and simply achieved with proper antibody orientation. This immunochip shown in this study could be used for diagnosis and monitoring of heart failure.
https://teams.igem.org/2886	Therapeutics	Cell therapy has shown great potential in cancer treatment these years, while the existing CAR-T cell therapy can only target on cell surface antigens. However, there are also many tumour markers free in the blood, also being important targets marking the location of tumour. Here we manage to construct a brand new transducer system, named STEP, to recognise small, soluble tumour markers (e.g. VEGF, AFP, TSGF). For that purpose, we adapt and optimise a newly developed system to transduce the input (free ligands) into release of a transcription factor and expression of desired drugs. To increase the recognition ability, we use Rosetta to redesign the interface between ligand and receptor in order to enhance the binding affinity. Our STEP system can be applied for detecting tumour markers in blood and secrete drug in real time to appropriate tissues, providing a new yet practical approach for cell therapy and cancer treatment.

https://teams.igem.org/2888	High School	The rampant growth of cyanobacteria in freshwater ecosystem has become more than an environmental issue. Their incredible ability to multiply and voracious consumption of oxygen often make them a disturbing factor to natural systems. Although effective ways to gather and salvage cyanobacteria have been developed, there are barely any success in decomposing these bacteria. Through background research, our team identified a cyanophage lysozyme, cp-OS lysozyme 1. Alone with other chemicals such as BugBuster, this lysozyme in small reaction systems could lyse the cyanobacteria effectively. Through molecular cloning, protein expression, and the subsequent purification, we were able to acquire the recombinant protein from E. coli cells, and we evaluated its enzymatic activity under different pH and temperatures. We also designed a prototype device in which immobilized lysozyme can be used to lyse cyanobacteria repeatedly. Our research lays foundation for the utilization of cyanobacteria components in agricultural, bioenergetic, and even medical fields.
https://teams.igem.org/2889	High School	Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults. Patients with RCC typically respond poorly to conventional treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying RCC progression, including metastasis, is required to improve RCC treatment. LncRNAs have been shown to have crucial roles in carcinogenesis and metastasis. LncRNA IL7-AS is a newly discovered lncRNA, which has been suggested to be associated with innate immunity. We first examined the expression pattern of IL7-AS in tumor tissues compared with normal tissues via mining various available public data sets, which has suggested IL7-AS may play an important role in carcinomas, especially in renal cell carcinoma. Our project will clone the different splices of IL7-AS and investigate the role of IL7-AS in renal cell carcinoma. Our studies may reveal that IL7-AS is a potential diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target for renal cell carcinoma.
https://teams.igem.org/2890	Village	Formaldehyde brings different degrees of harmful symptoms to us humans, such as eye, throat and skin irritation, and even carcinogenicity, which is widespread used in construction and decoration industries. In previous iGEM projects related to formaldehyde, several problems still need to improved, such as 1) the present sensing threshold of formaldehyde concentration (~ 10 ppm) is far upper beyond the environment-protecting standard (~ 0.1 ppm); 2) the degrading system seems to work unstably, although some survival or duration after formaldehyde addition was observed. Our project is aiming to construct a more sensitive and effective E. coli-based system for detecting and further degrading formaldehyde in environments, basing on current systems (already registered as BioBrick parts).

https://teams.igem.org/2893	High School	In 2017, Baltimore suffered from 301 homicides due to gun violence. As students who live in Baltimore City, we knew that this issue needed to be addressed. We decided to create a cost-efficient alternative to current fibrinogen-laced bandages on the market. Our method to cause blood clots was by expressing Factor V activator RVV-V gamma in E.coli. We intend to embed this protease into a bandage to treat gunshot or stab victims. We have also worked to enhance the expression of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), an enzyme that causes coagulated blood to degrade. We want to express an optimized sequence of tPA within E.coli. A purified form of this tPA would be used within an IV therapy for patients suffering from heart disease and other illnesses involving invasive blood clots. We hope to liberate communities within Baltimore by creating more balanced and equitable methods of treatment.

https://teams.igem.org/2895	New Application	Keratosis pilaris and Seborrheic keratosis are characterized by a buildup of keratin which are accompanied by redness and rashes. In severe cases, these skin conditions may be precancerous. Keratin is difficult to degrade due to the nature of its protein structures. However, complete degradation can be induced by the synergistic capacity of endo-acting, exo-acting, and oligopeptide-acting keratinases. We have engineered strains of E.coli to produce these keratinases and secrete them through the curli secretion pathway. We then encapsulated these modified bacteria in a hydrogel only permeable to the enzymes and essential nutrients for growth. Thus, we’ve created a prototype for a keratin-degrading patch to place on the afflicted area to mitigate the lesion, eliminating the need for conventional invasive treatments. The development of easily produced keratinases lends to future uses, such as management of agricultural waste and facilitated research in precancerous growths linked to excess of keratin.
https://teams.igem.org/2896	Environment	Accumulation of a hydrogen sulfide as a consequence of sulfur-containing “sour” oil refinement can be dangerous. H2S damages the drilling equipment and causes corrosion of transporting pipelines. We use Cyanobacteria as a chassis since the organism is autotrophic. We designed a Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 that expresses Sulfide Quinone Reductase (SQR) that catalyzes sulfide-dependent plastoquinone reduction in anaerobic conditions, while photosystem II stays inhibited due to sulfide being present. SQR converts Sulfide to elemental Sulfur which is stored in the bacteria and accumulates in the Biomass. The electron flow in this modified Photosynthetic Electron Transport Chain goes to a transgenic Hydrogenase making use of the existing anoxygenic conditions due to sulfide presence. The Biomass is finally converted to functional materials used for Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cells in accordance with a newly developed method in our laboratory.
https://teams.igem.org/2897	High School	For years, fish industry has been one of the most important economic resources. However , humans were not the only ones consuming this resource; some aquatic bacteria such as Vibrio anguillarum and many other bacteria species have evolved to prey on fish. This has caused huge economic losses in various countries’ fish industries. Humans responded to this problem by applying antibiotics, to which bacteria easily developed resistance. Another solution applied was vaccinations but they were ineffective for fish larvae .That’s why we need to find an effective solution that can adapt to its ever changing environment. For this we aim to use bacteriophages as a specialized lytic agent to eliminate fish pathogen. Due to resistant nature of bacteria we will support our bacteriophages with an antimicrobial peptide in a recombinant therapy where we will observe any potential synergy against Vibrio anguillarum“. We will execute our experiments in in-vitro environments .

https://teams.igem.org/2904	Foundational Advance	Riboswitches can sense a wide range of small molecules and regulate gene expression. However, because of the diversity of downstream GOI, the structures of the riboswitch are often unstable. So riboswitch cannot be considered as modular components. This year, OUC-China aims to design modular riboswitch consisting of original riboswitch, stabilizer, and tuner from 5' to 3'. The stabilizer can stabilize the structure of the riboswitch. The tuner can reduce the expression probability of fusion protein and allow for predictable tuning. Then more tuners are designed to make diverse expression level. Finally, we use asRNA to change the on-off state of riboswitches. All in all, we create modular riboswitch and introduce asRNA so that gene expression in engineered systems can be more easily regulated. Depending on this design principle, we'll create more "RiboLego".
https://teams.igem.org/2905	Therapeutics	Cardiovascular disease is a class of disease consisting of illnesses that affect the heart and blood vessels. This class of disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, responsible for one in every four deaths. Atherosclerosis is a type of cardiovascular disease that begins as macrophages and cholesterol infiltrate arterial walls forming atherosclerotic plaques. Formation of these plaques is instigated by Trimethylamine n-oxide (TMAO), with originates as the Carnitine metabolism byproduct Trimethylamine (TMA). Production of TMA is carried out by gut bacteria in the small intestine. We have sought to develop a counteracting bacteria that would degrade TMA before it is absorbed into the bloodstream. This probiotic strain contains genes from a Methanogenic bacteria that can convert the TMA into less harmful by-products.
https://teams.igem.org/2906	New Application	Current hair dyes contain many toxic chemicals i.e. Ammonia, which breaks open the outer layer of the hair to allow dyes to penetrate. These chemicals also cause severe allergic reactions and irreparable hair damage. The University of Manchester iGEM team hopes to tackle this problem by genetically engineering E.coli that binds to hair and secretes hair dyes in situ. The coloured proteins have hydrophobic tags that will allow them to anchor onto hair without breaking the cuticle. We have also taken this opportunity to integrate reparative and fragrant compounds to our product. Research has found that the pepG decapeptide can infiltrate the hair and reform disulphide bonds, effectively straightening and repairing hair. We have also worked on integrating limonene and vanillin production into our E.coli to make the hair fragrant. The combination of hair dyes, reparative and fragrant compounds means that our product will be an all-round hair care product.
https://teams.igem.org/2908	Therapeutics	Breast cancer is the second most common cancer in women. Despite success in several clinical trials, treatments remain limited by the high heterogeneity and invasiveness especially in triple negative breast cancer(TNBC). Based on these characteristics, our team has characterized a gene circuit with three modules. Controlled by TNBC-specific promoter 1, module 1 includes a miRNA binding site(BS) and a transcription factor which drives Module3 --- expression of a fusion protein composed of HIF1-&#945;oDDD and yeast cytosine deaminase (yCD) working under hypoxia conditions. Module 2 includes several sponge-like domains effectively down-regulating specific miRNA when promoter 2 is driven. Supposing the miRNA is highly expressed in the normal cells and low in most cancer cells, this circuit could trigger highly selective cytotoxicity of cancer cells. Once optimized, our design could be applied to current treatments, allowing for a more powerful therapeutic effect with a comparatively low risk.
https://teams.igem.org/2909	Village	Palm oil is the most widely used vegetable oil, with over 60 billion tons per year. However, its mass production has destructive consequences for the environment. Therefore, we want to demonstrate an alternative and ecological way of producing oil by developing a new chassis for the production of lipid compounds in a photosynthetic green microalga named Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. We want to build our proof-of-concept by modifying this microorganism to produce palmitic acid (C16:0) and oleic acid (C18:1), which are the main components of palm oil. To this end, we will express enzymes from the african oil palm Elaeis guineensis in C. reinhardtii using the Golden Gate Modular Cloning (MoClo) technology. Moreover, we will implement the HiBiT technology created by Promega in the MoClo kit by standardizing and integrating it into the C. reinhardtii MoClo kit in order to allow for a quick and effective measurement of our enzymes expression.
https://teams.igem.org/2910	Manufacturing	Plastic pollution is a large-scale environmental burden. An economy of single-use plastics, commonly made from polyethylene terephthalate (PET) due to its high crystallinity and resistance to degradation, has led to the production of millions of tons of plastic that is improperly disposed. Remarkably, an enzyme produced by Ideonella sakaiensis, termed PETase, can degrade this polymer at ambient temperatures. Combining the recent mutations derived from Austin et al., (2018) to increase the catalytic activity of PETase, our goal is to further optimize the thermostability and catalytic ability of PETase, through targeted mutagenesis, creating sequences using rational design and machine learning algorithms. With further optimization, we believe PETase may offer an eco-friendly and cost-effective solution to industrial plastic recycling efforts. Moreover, as the byproducts of PET degradation, terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG), are valuable feedstocks for PET production, this approach offers the possibility of close-loop recycling.
https://teams.igem.org/2911	Environment	Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a class of synthetic compounds used industrially for a wide variety of applications. Two PFAS chemicals, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorosulfanoic acid (PFOS), persist in the environment and are linked to cancer and birth defects. The accumulation of these compounds has been shown to cause cell-membrane disruption, oxidative stress, and DNA damage, but long term effects on humans are not completely understood. Technologies for testing PFAS levels in water are currently limited, costly, and time consuming. The USAFA iGEM team is genetically engineering bacteria to detect PFOA and PFOS, with the end goal of designing a bacterial biosensor that can be incorporated into a field test highly accessible to the Air Force.
https://teams.igem.org/2912	Manufacturing	Mikania micrantha Kunth is one of the most destructive invasive species in the world. It was introduced into China in the early 20th century, leading to great destruction of local environment. However, at present, the major approach for controlling Mikania micrantha Kunth is still chemical herbicide spray, which is associated with significant hazards to crops and environment. RNA interference (RNAi) is a conserved mechanism in eukaryotic organisms, in which sequence specific gene silencing is triggered by the introduction of dsRNA. In this project, we used RNAi technology to silence the genes encoding proteins with essential functions to induce mortality in Mikania micrantha Kunth through topical application of E Coli expressed RNAi molecules. In the meantime, we have developed a synthetic kit that can be used to synthesize RNAi nanoparticles of different sizes, and a siRNA sifting program for other researchers to select RNAi molecules for their specific purpose.
https://teams.igem.org/2913	Therapeutics	At the stages of high-burden tumors or metastasis, cancer patients may suffer from acute uric acid nephropathy due to rapid dissolution of tumor cells caused by conventional treatments, such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy. To solve the issue, we designed a novel and controllable system in E.coli Nissle 1917 that releases anti-tumor drugs in response to changes of uric acid levels, preventing the trouble of manual assessment and reduce the potential of acute uric acid nephropathy. Therefore, the tumor cells can be safely dissolved under the conditions of uric acid fluctuation within a physiologically tolerable range. Additionally, we designed a normal tissue-specific CodA expressing system, which can suppress bacterial growth with 5-Flucytosine administration. To enhance tumor elimination, we made bacteria express ftnA-M, a variant of ferritin iron storage protein, to attract engineered bacteria to tumor sites when exposed to a magnetic field.

https://teams.igem.org/2915	Diagnostics	Tuberculosis is a major public health problem in many regions of the world, both developing countries and in risky populations in richer countries. The Aix Marseille University iGEM team has developed their project I Want TB Free. The aim of this project is to develop a diagnostic test for tuberculosis that is cheap, rapid, specific and sensitive, has a long shelf-life and easily deployable in regions of the world with little or no scientific infrastructure. The test will specifically detect low levels of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in readily accessible sputum samples generating a colored band on a test strip, enabling earlier diagnosis and more effective treatment than currently available tests. The I want TB Free project is developed by a multidisciplinary team of students from different faculties and departments of Aix-Marseille University over the summer of 2019. The design builds on published work and integrates several innovations to achieve its aims.
https://teams.igem.org/2916	Environment	Our goal is to create a fast point-of-care nucleic acid test to differentiate between two grapevine diseases : Flavescence Dorée and Bois Noir. Flavescence Dorée is infectious and needs to be quarantined quickly while Bois Noir is not. We start by extracting DNA from infected plant material using a microneedle patch. We then amplify the sequences corresponding to grapevine (endogenous control) and the diseases (if they are present). This step is performed using Recombinase Polymerase Amplification, an isothermal nucleic acid amplification method. The created amplicons are transcribed into mRNA and bind to a toehold sensor, thus activating a reporter gene. Once this gene is translated, it produces catechol 2,3 dioxygenase which reacts with catechol and creates a colorimetric feedback. Both the transcription of the amplicons and the translation of the reporter gene are done in our homemade OnePot PURE cell-free system, which is freeze-dried on a paper strip.

https://teams.igem.org/2918	Foundational Advance	Engineering non-model bacteria is extremely laborious and expensive, which restricts the scope of synthetic biology to a small subset of the bacterial cosmos. In our project, we developed a tool that aims to expand the repertoire of bacterial species and broaden the range of substrates and environmental conditions which is currently used in synthetic biology. Sci-Phi 29 is a tool used to express genetic circuits independently of the bacterial host. Orthogonal replication of an exogenous DNA molecule is performed by the phi29 bacteriophage DNA replication system based on only four proteins. Furthermore, we developed a predictable and transferable expression system across multiple bacterial species. Our approach is based on an incoherent feed forward loop that ensures independence to DNA copy number and is robust to transcriptional and translational variations Sci-Phi 29 is a versatile platform to further explore the bacterial diversity providing new opportunities for the advancement of synthetic biology.
https://teams.igem.org/2919	Environment	This project aims to generate a bacterial chassis capable of utilizing the methane produced within landfills, usually an anaerobic environment, and to convert the methane into an industrially-useful compound. To achieve this, we will genetically modify Methylomicrobium alcaliphilum 20Z, that converts methane gas to 2,3-butanediol, in order to oxidize methane under anoxic conditions. Further, a 3D printed bioreactor will be tested and modeled to grow the bacteria in biofilms to be cultivated in landfills. A byproduct, formate, can build up in the bioreactors, acidifying the environment and potentially impairing biofilm growth. To prevent this, a formate biosensor will be engineered, causing cells to fluoresce when concentrations are high. We plan to limit plasmid transfer by using a modified toxin-antitoxin system. Alongside our outreach efforts, our project has aimed to increase efficiency and safety of implementing an engineered methanotrophic bacteria into natural environments.

Our team consists of 15 students working together in multidisciplinary teams to achieve our goal. Our members come from different backgrounds, with majors such as chemistry, chemical engineering, biology. However, we have something in common- we all are interested in synthetic biology and admire the concept of iGEM. At first, we were frustrated because of all of the details that need to be carefully accounted for, but after a lot of dedication , we observed that people are suffering HAI(Hospital Acquired Infection) these days. It can't be denied how crucial the whole environment is to this human being. Therefore, we invented a new product and named it EcoLife", with its primary purpose being a air purifier. With this product, we are looking to provide a instrument alternative for those who pursue a healthy life.
https://teams.igem.org/2921	High School	We consume fruits and vegetables every day without knowing whether or not agricultural residues (i.e. pesticides & heavy metals) are present or in what concentration. In 2017, according to the UN, exposure to pesticides caused 200,000 to 300,000 deaths annually. Additionally, lead exposure alone is responsible for a death rate of 25.3 deaths per 100,000 individuals in East Asia. Current methods of agricultural residue detection are not easily accessible to the public and are inconvenient for everyday use. Thus, our project aims to allow for convenient visualization of agricultural residues by designing colored proteins that can directly interact with these residues. We envision a system where our designed proteins can be applied directly on food items to detect the presence of residues. Our final product can be used by consumers, distributors and farmers alike.

We split the "cooperative" genes--cenA, cex and bgl1A, which are capable of degrading cellulose, and respectively transform them into two kinds of bacteria so as to help these bacteria survive better under the cellulose situation. At the same time, the two types of bacteria carry different "aggressive" genes--Colicin E1 and Colicin N, who would start the period of expressing proteins due to the induction caused by different inducers and consequently harm each other. By designing genetic circuit of different relationships, the ultimate aim of us is to find the possible applications for synthetic biology in sociology.
https://teams.igem.org/2923	Food & Nutrition	The prevalence of food allergies is currently increasing to reach 10% worldwide. Food allergy and intolerance can become a burden in the daily life of people. This is strengthened by the evolution of food habits. New products on the market, transformation processes and the eating tendency of the population (fast foods, canteens, ready meals) contribute to the emergence of new allergens. Many new allergic reactions are due to ingredients which are not labeled correctly. We aim to facilitate the life of people who suffers from food allergies by offering a food allergen detection kit with colored signal system. It should be fast and portable for easy on-site use, as well as versatile to adapt to any allergen. It is based on a triple hybrid system implemented in E. coli. Flexibility will be provided thanks to an aptazyme which will be interchanged for specific allergens.
https://teams.igem.org/2924	Food & Nutrition	Our project is the production of the natural components of cows milk using methods from synthetic biology to modify microorganisms. This solution can provide the world with milk without risking the environmental damage caused by massive animal farms, while providing an authentic alternative. This lactose-free milk will be available to a larger number of people around the world. The first step to creating our SynMylk is the production of the components of cows milk that the chemical industry cannot provide without using animal products. These components are the milks proteins and lipids. We modified Bacillus subtilis, Pichia pastoris and the photosynthetic cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 to produce the milk proteins heterologously. The synthesis of lipids is enhanced by overexpressing enzymes that are bottlenecks in Synechocystis natural fatty acid production. Heterologous enzymes are also expressed to specifically obtain certain lengths of lipids, which are not naturally produced.
https://teams.igem.org/2925	Food & Nutrition	Catechins, molecules that boost cardiovascular health and prevent cancer, are found naturally in the camellia sinensis plant, which is used to make oolong tea and green tea. However, the concentration of catechins in these consumable products is quite low, and these beverages can have an unpleasant taste to some people. Therefore, we have created a genetically engineered non-pathogenic strain of E. Coli that can produce catechins. These catechins can be further purified and encapsulated to create a concentrated catechin supplement, which can be taken to boost cardiovascular health and minimize the risk of cancer. In order to create this catechin-producing E. coli, we utilized molecular biology techniques including PCR, gel electrophoresis, plasmid assembly, and high-performance liquid chromatography. We then tested our synthetically produced catechins on cancer cells in order to determine the antioxidant effects of the product.
https://teams.igem.org/2926	Foundational Advance	Remember the trojan horse? With this trick Greeks snuck into Troy. Inspired by this story we engineered Troygenics, molecular trojan horses, that enter and transform eukaryotic cells. Eukaryotic pathogens including numerous fungi are a growing threat to crops, animals and humans. Common treatments lack specificity and are frequently overcome by resistances. In a novel mode of action, our Troygenics enter these pathogens via endocytosis and deliver a Cell Death Inducing System (CeDIS). Troygenics consist of modified M13 coat-proteins assembled by Escherichia coli and contain ssDNA encoding the specific CeDIS based on Cas13a. Pathogen-specific ligands fused to the coat proteins enhance uptake via endocytosis. We incorporated sophisticated biosafety mechanisms to achieve selective transformation of the targeted pathogen. Among other methods, we demonstrated the functionality of the Troygenics applying a self-developed low-cost microfluidic system. In conclusion, we engineered an innovative platform technology customizable to target various eukaryotic pathogens.
https://teams.igem.org/2927	Diagnostics	African Swine Fever Virus (ASFV) is a serious epidemic disease worldwide. The ease of infection and high mortality rate has caused serious market imbalance. ASF has spread throughout Asia, so Taiwan is surrounded by epidemic regions. Recognizing this problem, we created "ASFAST". ASFAST combines the CRISPR Cas system with PicoGreen fluorescence signal transduction. We use Cas12a protein with crRNA to recognize the ASFV p72 capsid protein sequence. When the Cas12a protein is activated, a fluorescent signal will be detected by our sensor. ASFAST can detect the virus within 7 days of infection, which means during the incubation period. Based on this advantage, we plan to develop an early detection system as part of a routine health check for non-epidemic regions. After the test, the ASFAST device will immediately send the data to a cloud database so the government can monitor the results in real time.
https://teams.igem.org/2928	High School	With an estimated 500 million patients worldwide, Diabetes mellitus (DM) presents a major threat to human health. Largely attributed to genetics and lifestyle choices, Type II DM reduces insulin responses to elevations in blood glucose. Though current treatments for pre-diagnosed DM patients largely include drug prescriptions and restrictive diets, we believe a supplement to ease dietary constraints would be beneficialparticularly within the Japanese community. For our project, we designed a construct that will express a wheat albumin (0.19), which acts as an &#945;-amylase inhibitor, thus hindering &#945;-amylases ability to break starches into glucose. Specific amino acid substitutions were made in 0.19 to improve inhibitory activity. Our proposed delivery mechanism is through miso, a staple Japanese bean paste. With this supplement, patients will not be completely restricted from the traditionally high-carb Japanese dietpresenting a potential strategy for reducing carbohydrate-based dietary restrictions experienced by many pre-diagnosed type II DM patients.

By combining machine learning and rational design approaches, we sought to adapt this crosslinking to stabilise the antibody CH3 domain, with a view to creating long-lasting Immunotherapeutics. We also undertook a search of known protein structures to identify suitable candidate proteins for stabilisation via isopeptide bonding, and present this list for future work.
https://teams.igem.org/2930	Environment	Despite being coined the Tobacco Mosaic Virus, TMV is known to infect over 350 different species of plants around the globe, threatening crop yields for dependant farmers. Because the virus is spread between plants via pollinators such as bees, the preventative solution has been to use pesticides to avoid interaction between the bees and the affected crops. To alleviate the spread of TMV while simultaneously preserving environmental safety, we looked into expressing the yeast gene, XRN1 in plants. By producing the protein XRN1-p, yeast has a means of breaking down non-local and invasive RNA, a system that the eukaryotic N. Benthamiana does not have. Ultimately, by expressing the yeast gene in our tobacco plants, we hope to both test whether it would successfully breakdown the viral RNA while also exploring whether yeast gene expression in plants is viable.

https://teams.igem.org/2932	High School	Indoor air pollution could be worse than outdoor air. Thats why people buy air purifiers at home. Yet, CO2 and VOCs cannot be eliminated by any current machine. Algae purification system is increasingly getting attention but with limited efficiency. This year, we improve the system significantly by combining a photobioreactor device and algae culture media supplemented with natural enzymes. We produce carbonic anhydrase (CA) to enhance CO2 dissolving rate, as well as CYP2E1 to break down chloroform and benzene. The resulting molecules can easily be taken up by algae. Our device sets up with a nano bubble generator, high power LED light, and CO2/O2 sensors to optimize photosynthesis and analyze air quality, and as small as a portable 1L water bottle. In addition, we used mathematical modeling to simulate the application in the real world. We believe it will be the most common air purifier in our life.
https://teams.igem.org/2933	Therapeutics	With the continuous emergence and rapid spread of multidrug-resistant bacteria (MDRB) resulting from the misuse of antibiotics, it is imperative to develop novel therapies against them. One of the major mechanisms of bacterial resistance is that MDRB can produce beta-lactamases which degrade antibiotics, so finding new-type inhibitors is significant in the treatment of diseases associated with MDRB. Therefore, we focus our project on hitting Achilles' heel of metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs), a vital class of beta-lactamases without available clinical inhibitors. We use synthetic biology methods to express a series of MBLs in E. coli, and then screen out effective inhibitor compounds via high-throughput screening with fluorescent probe (CDC-1) from several drug libraries. Also we assess their inhibitory ability in living bacterial cells by UV-vis. Our results shows that screened inhibitors improve the effect of beta-lactams when applied simultaneously to living bacteria, which are ideal candidates for therapeutics for diseases caused by MDRB.
https://teams.igem.org/2934	Food & Nutrition	Honeybees produce honey to make the flower's nectar more digestible and well-preserved, using various enzymes secreted to their honey stomach. The honey possesses unique properties that make it highly attractive in fields such as medicine, cosmetics, and food industry. Nowadays, the honey industry depends on honey produced by bees, which therefore harm them and their natural social structure. Our vision is to create a sustainable "bee-free honey" using engineered bacteria, which will process a nectar-like solution and secrete enzymes that mimic the honey stomach environment. The engineered bacteria will be separated from the final product using membrane-based capsules, providing the bacteria's favorable growth medium inside the capsule, while allowing enzymes secretion to the external "nectar" solution. We have also designed a synthetic circuit that will regulate the transcription of the essential enzymes, enabling us to obtain a solution consisting of real honey properties.
https://teams.igem.org/2935	Energy	We use Chlamydomonas reinhardtii as the chassis organism and build a general platform in it to produce biodiesel. Our system can produce cheaper biodiesel. We search for several enzymes and transcription factors in the metabolic pathway of algae, which can increase the oil content and biomass. We construct the corresponding vectors and use electroporation technology to improve the expression of the corresponding genes and TF. We build a light-controlled system to promote the expression of downstream self-flocculating genes when algae receives a specific wavelength of light. With this system, we can collect microalgae at a specific growth period. In addition, we determined the concentration of domestic sewage suitable for engineering microalgae culture through sampling investigation and simulation experiment, and cultivated our algae in it. This can increase the biomass of microalgae and reduce the content of nitrogen and phosphorus in sewage, which further reducing the cost of sewage treatment.
https://teams.igem.org/2936	Environment	Formaldehyde is a serious threat to human health while it almost exists everywhere especially in newly decorated rooms. This year, our team focus on the degradation of formaldehyde using E. coli. Our genetically engineered bacteria contain three parts: the degradation device&#12289;the indication device and the photolysis device. The degradation device acting as the core turns formaldehyde into carbon dioxide with several protein. At the same time, the indication device shows users if the concentration of formaldehyde is safe to live. When the concentration is higher than a threshold value, the medium gives a blue color, otherwise it appears orange. In consideration of biosafety, we integrate a photolysis system which expresses lysin protein when exposed under blue light, thus our HCHO-scavenger works in the dark. The lysed bacteria can be recycled in the end.
https://teams.igem.org/2937	High School	Fragrance generating parts are becoming more and more demanded in iGEM projects, as well as manufacture industries. While identifying that previous parts introduced by past teams were barely re-used, or integrated, thus we focus to build a library of fragrance-generating genes, in order to give better access with higher clarity, and reduce unnecessary time lost to those who may concern. The library will include about 30 coding sequences encode enzyme yielding fragrant substances from iGEM projects, constructed on vector psb4c5. Necessary information of parts will be added based on our own characterization results, as also 5 new parts will be included in the collection, for expression phenyethyl acetate, production route of Ehrlich pathway. Molecules are detected through GC/MS, to validate success of expression of each part. Also, we deem that cell free system can be used for educational purposes, as we apply our project on it for public engagement.
https://teams.igem.org/2938	New Application	Life-threatening diseases such as Malaria, Dengue fever and Zika fever are caused by parasites transmitted through mosquitoes. Most of these diseases have no treatment or effective prophylaxis, and vector control is the preferable mode of action. However, traditional methods using insecticides are not efficient and an environmental hazard, indicating the need for an effective and eco-friendly solution. In the FlyGEM project, we took advantage of the Bacillus thuringiensis israeliensis (Bti), a gram-positive, spore-forming bacterium that produces insecticidal toxins and virulence factors that selectively target the larval mosquito stages. We genetically engineered a bacterium that expresses Bti toxin in the gut microbiome of adult mosquitoes. Mosquitoes fed by Bti-toxin expressing bacteria were not affected, however the bacteria are delivered to the eggs and the expressed Bti is toxic for the hatching and nearby larvae. Thus, our Trojan Mosquito can specifically target the larvae and reduce mosquito population to control mosquito-borne diseases.
https://teams.igem.org/2939	Environment	The application of nitrogen fertilizers to agricultural crops often causes eutrophication of freshwater sources and environmental damage. Additionally, nitrogen fertilizers are currently produced using the Haber-Bosch process which is very energy intensive and uses large amounts of the worlds natural gas supply. With a growing population, new methods are needed to improve agricultural sustainability and yields. Some plants form a natural symbiosis with bacteria that can take nitrogen from the atmosphere and provide it to the plant, in a process termed nitrogen fixation. Unfortunately, many agricultural crops lack symbiotic nitrogen fixing partners. A major crop lacking a bacterial partner is maize. We are attempting to take a natural colonizer of corn roots, Pseudomonas protogens, and introduce a 27 kb gene cluster from Rhodopseudomonas palustris that encodes the ability to fix nitrogen. If successful, this organism could reduce the need for industrially fixed nitrogen fertilizers.
https://teams.igem.org/2940	Environment	Dye pollution in water is a major threat to public health and has profound negative effects on the environment. A recent study found that up to 70% of waterways are polluted in major textile producing regions as a result of textile dyeing. Azo-dyes are the most common synthetic dyes and are widely used in the textile, leather and printing industries. Some azo-dyes and their derivatives have toxic and mutagenic effects. We are tackling this problem by (I) improving the enzymatic function of azo-dye degrading enzymes, (II) immobilizing the enzymes as a delivery system, (III) developing biosensors to test contaminants in waste effluents, and (IV) the use of azo-dyes derivatives as a carbon source to produce synthetic spider silk. The main aim of this project is to reduce the environmental impact of azo-dye pollution and to explore novel technologies to promote a sustainable textile industry using circular economy principles.
https://teams.igem.org/2941	Diagnostics	Antibody based diagnostic tests or immunoassays are widely used to quicken treatment decision-making and to enable patients to test themselves for example for pregnancy. However, the analyte binding antibodies in conventional immunoassays are randomly immobilized onto a test surface blocking some binding sites from the analytes. When the concentration of a disease marker as the analyte is below the detection limit or the sensitivity, the signal could be improved by orienting the antibodies. Our objective was to orientate a digoxigenin binding Fab fragment of the antibody by incorporating a p-azido-L-phenylalanine, an unnatural amino acid with click chemistry properties. As a control, we used a chemically treated Fab including azide in random locations. The Fabs were immobilized onto DBCO coated magnetic beads and the bound fluorescently labeled digoxigenin was measured with flow cytometry. According to the results, orientation improved the signal and made the test surface more homogeneous.
https://teams.igem.org/2942	WIKI	Cancer remains a leading cause of death in the world. Oncolytic virus, as a kind of new anticancer therapy combining the advantages of immunotherapy, gene therapy and targeted therapy, may be a promising solution. Alphavirus M1 is a natural existing non-pathogenic oncolytic virus. However, a large proportion of tumors are not sensitive enough to M1. To further enhance the therapeutic efficacy of oncolytic virotherapy, cancer chemotherapy is commonly use, which usually lacks tumor specificity and causes severe systemic side-effects. Our project is to engineer M1 to specifically encode and express enzymes that can convert prodrugs into active therapeutic metabolites, and enhance bystander effects. We also utilize riboswitch to enhance the dynamic regulation of M1. Meanwhile the Chemotherapeutic drugs can boost the tumor infectivity and lethality in diverse tumors with low sensitivity to M1. We hope to provide a novel anticancer therapeutic modality by combining oncolytic virus M1 with targeted chemotherapy.
https://teams.igem.org/2943	Therapeutics	Antibiotic resistance is defined by WHO as one of the biggest threats to global health. We suggest a solution that involves the use of R-type Pyocins, protein complexes produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Pyocins resemble bacteriophage structures while the killing spectra is determined by the pyocin tail fiber. Pyo-Pyo is a modular and controllable system created in a non-pathogenic E. coli which is served as a flexible drug factory. By replacing the original pyocin tail fibers with other tails the pyocins are engineered to target different bacterial pathogens. Our solution also includes software, based on novel algorithms, for both designing the relevant tail fibers to target specific bacteria, and for optimizing the distribution of the pyocins in a specific medium for cost-effective usage. In further experiments, we wish to regulate the expression of the pyocins by varying inducing agents and to provide a complete POC for a variety of future uses.
https://teams.igem.org/2944	Diagnostics	Fentanyl, an opioid painkiller, is the leading cause of accidental opioid overdose as many recreational drugs are unknowingly laced with it. Our solution: Quantifen! Quantifen is a non-invasive wearable biosensor adapted for fentanyl detection in sweat. Taking the form of a temporary tattoo consisting of conductive ink layers and cellular-functionalized iontophoretic hydrogels, biological detection is converted into electrical output. This output is transferred as data to our app, warning the user of fentanyl consumption via mobile alerts or by contacting emergency services. The biosensor consists of a genetic circuit which produces glucose oxidase (GOx) in response to fentanyl binding to receptor protein FEN21. GOx undergoes electrochemical reactions, creating current which is carried via screen-printed conductive inks to a printed circuit board (PCB) in the wearable device; it then communicates with the users smartphone. The biosensor can be adapted for detection of other drugs or small molecules due to its modularity.

https://teams.igem.org/2946	Therapeutics	Protecting healthy tissue from off-tumor toxicity is a major challenge facing all strategies for cancer immuno-gene therapy. Implementing logic AND gates to strictly confine the expression of therapeutic genes or their effects to selected target cells is an intriguing concept in this direction. In a 2017 Cell paper Nissim et al. presented a revolutionary AND gate device comprising a two-module mRNA circuit and demonstrated the expression of a multi-component immunostimulatory cassette only in cancer cells in which two distinct promoters are active. A major safety concern associated with this design is inevitable, potentially detrimental, basal off-target expression of genes of interest. To obviate this risk we have created LoGENEgate, an entirely new AND gate apparatus based on mRNA trans-splicing. Here we show that unlike the original Cell modules, LoGENEgate totally precludes expression of a model gene in off-target cells. Our findings pave the way for numerous therapeutic applications of LoGENEgate.
https://teams.igem.org/2947	High School	The rhizomes and roots of Rhodiola rosea have been used for centuries for medicinal purposes.Recent interest in the species Rhodiola rosea in the West arose from the use of the rhizome as an adaptogen for the treatment of stress, but in the last few years, chemical and pharmacological studies have confirmed other valuable medicinal properties. Approaches on biosynthesis of salidroside in Rhodiola rosea and its key metabolic enzymes have been published, and the required precursor substance exist in Nicotiana benthamiana have been found. Arabidopsis thaliana has the potential of synthetizing salidroside which worth researching. Hence, we were inspired to combine the key metabolic enzymes and these two plants, which are further more competent in commercial production. Our project aims to use the techniques of synthetic biology to provide a sustainable way to obtain large quantities of salidroside in arabidopsis protoplasts.
https://teams.igem.org/2948	High School	A coral reefs is an underwater ecosystem. Corals owe their beautiful colors in part to symbiotic algae, which live inside the coral cells. Coral reefs are sensitive to the temperature of the water for algaes respond to elevated temperatures which connects with the coral bleaching. We concerned about how exactly the coral bleaching happened and found that the hydrogen peroxide may be the most significant signaling molecule between coral and algae in this intercellular communication . Algae has enzymes to remove hydrogen peroxide.Since the global warming,the concentration of hydrogen peroxide has been up too much that they can't afford.Hence the relationship between Corals and Algae gradually break up. We foucs on key enzyme which takes part in removing hydrogen peroxide in algae, hoping to optimize this enzyme by the help of synthetic biology analysis, so as to help restore the coral-zooxanthellae symbiosis against coral bleaching.
https://teams.igem.org/2949	Environment	In this project, we intended to immobilized the mutated carbonic anhydrase (CA&#8545;) estabilied last year on carriers with amino groups to further improve its application in CO2 capture. Specifically, site-specific immobilization method was realized via protein labeling. Firstly, sulphatase motif (LCTASR) was added to the terminus of mutated carbonic anhydrase (CA&#8545;-LCTASR) by genetic engeneering method; then, an aldehyde tag was introduced to the mutated carbonic anhydrase by co-transforming the recombinant plasmid CA&#8545;-LCTASR and formyglycine-modified enzyme expression system myc-his A Rv0712 (FGE) into E.coli TB1; finally, the aldehyde-tagged CA&#8545; were immobilized via forming covalent with amino functionalized supports through the Schiff base reaction. Our results revealed that CA&#8545; could be successfully immobilized and retained its original activity.
https://teams.igem.org/2950	High School	Lacquer and carmine (a red dye) play important roles in the preservation and production of traditional Chinese lacquerware. Currently, however, attaining raw lacquer requires complicated, harmful manual extraction from Rhus verniciflua (lacquer tree), and the production efficiency of carmine from cochineals is low. We utilize E. coli to synthesize laccase and todC1C2ABD, four enzymes that can convert hexadecylbenzene to urushiol, the other functional component of raw lacquer aside from laccase; in S. cerevisiae, we aim to produce carminic acid, the major red component of carmine. The laccase, urushiol, and carminic acid are mixed with several cost-effective ingredients, resulting in an artificial red-colored lacquer that can be easily applied in industrial and domestic contexts. This synthetic biological method avoids the potential danger due to unknown natural components and expands the potential of inheriting and further developing lacquerware culture.
https://teams.igem.org/2951	Diagnostics	Influenza spreads around the world in a yearly outbreak, resulting in 3~5 million cases of severe illness and 250,000~500,000 deaths. The recent antibody-type flu screening is approximately 60% accurate and only distinguishes the basic types of influenza. Antigenic drift and shift make the prediction of the upcoming epidemic subtype of influenza a challenging task. Antibodies take time to be developed, but this slow yet potent remedy cant meet its urgent demands. To solve this problem, we utilize aptamer which is known for its specific recognition of unique proteins of influenza viruses. By improving the conventional method, we developed a rapid detection device which effectively targets influenza. Furthermore, we have also managed to exploit the aptamers to inhibit virus infection. Our project not only seeks to provide a lower cost, fast production and highly-stable detection tool, but also has strong potential for new treatment and prevention.
https://teams.igem.org/2952	Energy	The energy supply sector is the largest contributor to CO2 emissions. With the UK's target of net zero emissions by 2050, this industry will have to reduce it's dependance on natural gas. Hydrogen is an alternative, however current methods of renewable production render it economically unfeasible. We've sought to make hydrogen a green yet cost effective solution. We've created a novel biological chassis that exploits both fermentative and photosynthetic pathways for biohydrogen gas production. By genetically engineering hydrogenases from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Pyrococcus furiosus into Rhodobacter spheroids, in order to direct more reducing power towards hydrogen synthesis. Our idea to improve photo-fermentative pathways came after researching drawbacks of co-culture experiments. We have also designed 'Hydrolytes', devices to allow our bacteria to grow and collect the hydrogen produced. While also running of waste resources, our project has specifically centered on off-the-grid coal-dependant locations worst effected by Fuel Poverty in Scotland.
https://teams.igem.org/2954	Energy	Creating a plant that can glow in the dark is not a unique project; it has been tried before and not with much success, which is why we are taking a more conservative approach to this project: By testing various parts of gene constructs and bioluminescent systems we can quantify and show the best parts available for someone to make a functional glowing plant. The parts we are testing in a bacterial chassis (E. Coli) and then in a plant chassis (Nicotiana Benthamiana) are Promoters, Mutated LuxAB Complexes, Riboswitch, and Fluorescent Reporter Genes. By using IIS Restriction we can interchange any part of a gene construct with relative ease allowing us to quickly test and compare various constructs due to the modular nature of our cloning method. Optoplant will provide the first basis for others working with bioluminescence systems and plant engineering.
https://teams.igem.org/2955	Environment	Glyphosate (N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine), the active ingredient in the popular herbicide RoundupTM, has been used extensively for over 25 years. Glyphosate has long been thought to degrade in the environment and pose no risk to human health. However, studies have recently shown that it persists longer in soil and the World Health Organization (WHO) classified it as a potential carcinogen in 2015. Given these potential risks, we sought to address the issue of environmental persistence by engineering E. coli to degrade glyphosate. Using Gibson cloning, we expressed glyphosate-degrading genes hph and C-N lyase in NEB 10-beta competent E. coli. Preliminary growth experiments showed engineered E. coli has higher glyphosate tolerance than the wild type. We are developing analytical methods to quantify glyphosate degradation. Our results suggest that glyphosate-degrading microbes may have a role in future glyphosate bioremediation strategies.
https://teams.igem.org/2956	Manufacturing	Flavonoids are the largest phytonutrients found in plantae, well-known for their anti-cancerous, antioxidant components. A modern problem hampering access and usage of these molecules is difficulty in their isolation and quantification. This calls for optimization either through pathway engineering or possibly finding a new approach to isolate and extract these molecules. The NYU iGEM laboratory has approached this current problem from a biosynthetic perspective with a conjunction of optogenetics and engineering. We have inserted multiple pathways to induce and inhibit the production of our target flavonoids in E.coli. This will work by ligating the pathway genes with an inducible promoter that is activated by green light and repressed by red light in a matter of hours. The testing of the system is being performed in a bioreactor that follows industrial protocol and the extraction quantification will be tested by gas chromatography and High performance liquid chromatography.
https://teams.igem.org/2957	Foundational Advance	Cell coordination within a population depends on an individual cells ability to accurately receive and respond to extracellular stimuli from the environment and neighboring cells. Coordinating cellular motility, where cells move in response to external cues, is central to many physiological responses. For example, human neutrophils demonstrate migratory behavior towards chemokine gradients as part of the adaptive immune system. Here, we present a mechanism to harness cellular chemotaxis to control cellular swarming and directed movement. We engineered human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells to secrete chemokines that induce chemotaxis in unengineered neutrophils. To evaluate chemotaxis, we first differentiated HL-60 cells into chemotactic neutrophils. We then introduced chemokines produced by our engineered HEK cells and evaluated neutrophil movement utilizing several cellular migration assays. We anticipate our engineered system will provide insight into how immune systems develop as well as form a preliminary toolbox for recruiting mammalian cells selectively in tissue engineering applications.
https://teams.igem.org/2958	Village	Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder characterized by high glucose levels over a prolonged period of time. It affects approximately 371 million people worldwide (WHO, 2014). Current treatments include injections and pumps, but insulin production cost has been ever-increasing due to monopoly companies. The Open Insulin Project's goal is to manufacture cheap insulin and analogues and making the protocol public. We are contributing by synthesizing human proinsulin and 3 novel single chain insulins(SCI) that replace the C-peptide with different novel linkers. Our first SCI contains the native A&B chains (pI 5.50). The second SCI is a long-lasting insulin, with an AsnA21Ala mutation (pI 6.46). The third insulin is a fast-acting insulin, with the LysB28 and ProB29 flipped (pI 5.50). Our goal is to secrete these insulins from the periplasmic membrane of E. coli BL21, purify using nickel purification and TEV protease, and characterize using the Elisa and glucose uptake assay.
https://teams.igem.org/2959	Environment	<i>Verticillium dahliae</i> is a phytopathogenic fungus that affects more than 300 species worldwide. It attacks plants vascular system causing wilting, also reduces the products quality affecting overall crop production. Every year, around 150,000 tons of cotton have been lost per year due to this particular organism. To prevent and inhibit the disease caused by <i>V. dahliae</i>, the transformation of <i>E. coli</i> to produce the three following plant antifungal peptides recombinantly, is presented: AtPFN1 has shown the ability to break down fungal cell walls, even when found as spores; WAMP1B inhibits the enzyme fungalysin, which is a fungal response to the plants defense mechanism; Finally, PsDef1 produces morphological changes to fungal mycelium. Moreover, the coexpression of the peptides with chaperone molecule Erv1p is designed to improve disulfide bond formation. Additionally, the elaboration of a systemic, preventive and treating biofungicide using the produced recombinant antifungal peptides as an active ingredient, is proposed.
https://teams.igem.org/2960	Environment	Every year, streams and rivers across the world are stricken with algal blooms. While already negative for the ecosystem, some are even more deadly. These harmful algal blooms (HABs) create microcystins, toxic chemicals that are long-lasting and contaminate drinking and irrigation systems. Our system has two parts: a biological sensor to detect the presence of microcystines and a filter for environmental remediation. Our sensor consists of an RNA aptamer conjugated to gold particles, which specifically binds our target microcystin-LR and produces a colorimetric change. Our filter is comprised of a specific cassette of enzymes endogenous to Sphingopyxis sp. It consists of a packed-bed-reactor, where we pass water through a chamber containing our engineered strain immobilized on alginate beads. By putting this system on a device that can traverse the span of lake or river, we hope this will stand as a major improvement in the detection and treatment of HABs.
https://teams.igem.org/2961	Diagnostics	In an effort to reduce the inequality in global healthcare, increase the efficiency of labs, and minimize biohazards, our team developed CASPRE; a synthetic biology kit that provides preliminary genetic testing for carriers of recessive traits. CASPREs biological mechanism utilizes CRISPR-Cas12a protein, specifically- designed guide RNA (gRNA), and fluorescing reporters to identify the presence of a disorder-causing SNP. Upon the extraction of the DNA from a saliva sample, Cas12a scans the DNA searching for a complementary sequence to the gRNA. If complementary binding occurs, a reaction complex forms and triggers an indiscriminate cleavage activity. Through this, a single-stranded DNA linking the reporter and its quencher degrades and allows the emission of fluorescence. Then, CASPREs developed, hand-held device and user-friendly application work in tandem to detect and interpret the emitted fluorescence producing a +/- diagnoses. Within a few minutes, we become a step closer to a more aware community.
https://teams.igem.org/2962	High School	Laccase has been used for many projects over the years because of its wide range of substrate differing from lignin to other aromatic compounds. This feature makes this enzyme one of the most promising biological solutions for optimising the degradation of industrial waste. Our aim is to design a signal peptide for T. versicolor laccase enzyme and then integrate the gene that codes this signal peptide sequence in Escherichia coli. PelB will be the signal peptide that will direct the laccase enzyme to the periplasmic domain in the E. coli Shuffle strain, facilitating the formation of disulphide bonds, thus increasing its activity and stability. We also plan to use disulphate bonding isomerase (dbs) on other group to see if it is more effective than leading laccase to the periplasm. This way, we will overcome the yield problem that creates a bottleneck for industrial use.
https://teams.igem.org/2963	Manufacturing	&#947;-polyglutamic acid (&#947;-PGA) is an emerging biopolymer being widely used in cosmetics, biomedicine and othe fields. D-glutamate-rich &#947;-PGA is industrially produced by natural strain Bacillus species. D-glutamate degrades more slowly and L- glutamate has better biocompatibility. Therefore, &#947;-PGA with tailored L/D glutamate ratio is demanded for more diverse applications. By constructing the biobricks of &#947;-PGA synthase complex, 0.696 g/L L-glutamate-rich &#947;-PGA was accumulated in Corynebacterium glutamicum. Using the mathematical models based on the fermentation profile, the fermentation was optimized, and 15 times more &#947;-PGA was produced than that before. By introducing glutamate racemase gene racE under different Ptac promoter mutants, the L-glutamic acid content in &#947;-PGA varies from 97.1% to 36.9%. Finally, we devoted to fine tune the D/L-monomer ratio using standarized RBS elements (RBS modified with bicistron design). Our project provides a method for customerized polymer biosynthesis with precisely controlled D/L ratio, and may expand to other biopolymer synthesis.
https://teams.igem.org/2965	Diagnostics	The incidence and mortality of cervical cancer in China has continued to rise. To solve the problem, our team designed and manufactured a set of household HPV detector for HPV early screening. Our detector will use female menstrual blood as teat sample and support two detection methods. The first method is based on CRISPR/Cas system. After rupturing the cervical epithelial cells in menstrual blood, we amplified the target with RPA, then identified it with Cas12a protein. This method is highly specific and can be used for HPV typing. However, in HPV screening, the key is to detect multiple HPV subtypes simultaneously. Therefore, to implement multi-channel detection, we designed another method. It uses Exo&#8546; to assist signal amplification and uses hybridization chain reaction to further amplify the signal. Both methods report the result using test paper. We have also designed three versions of PaDetector to better meet user needs.
https://teams.igem.org/2966	Food & Nutrition	Every year, approximately 30 percent of rice crops across the world are damaged due to Magnaporthe oryzae, commonly known as rice blast fungus. While rice plants have receptors that sense chitin from fungal pathogens, M. oryzae secretes a chitinase to break down its own chitin before it is detected. Using this chitinase, M. oryzae is able to avoid triggering the rice's defense mechanism that would inhibit the spread of the fungal infection. However, by preemptively exposing the rice plant to chitin it is possible to trigger the rices defense mechanisms before M. oryzae can suppress detection methods. In order to accomplish this, we worked to develop a method of exposing rice plants to chitin by introducing NodC, a chitin synthase homolog, into Pseudomonas fluorescens, a bacterium that naturally lives on rice leaves. By decreasing crop losses, our project can work towards increasing global food supply and bring agricultural innovation.
https://teams.igem.org/2967	Therapeutics	Our project is interested in utilizing genetically engineered Escherichia coli to relief symptoms of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). The engineered E.coli strain should include three characteristics, including precisely colonize in the inflammatory region; successfully express and secrete anti-inflammatory proteins; without any biological hazards or side-effects. Firstly, we designed several plasmid based-bio-sensors for detecting one of the IBD signals, nitric oxide. After a series of comparison, our experiments demonstrated that yeaR based NO sensor with the highest efficiency in E. coli Nissle 1917 strain. Secondly, we integrated two anti-inflammatory factors, interlukin-10 (IL-10) and myrosinase into the Yebf expression plasmid under the tunable-gain amplifier regulation. Lastly, for the biosafety concern, we designed the kill-switch system which based on the mazE-mazF system, a natural toxin system found in E. coli that enable to kill bacteria under the low temperature trigger, once the anti-inflammatory E. coli was excreted out of the gut.
https://teams.igem.org/2968	Foundational Advance	With the development of gene editing tools, such as CRISPR-Cas9, TALENS and Zinc finger nucleases gene therapy has become sophisticated enough to be clinically applied. Multiple gene therapy delivery systems are currently available, including viral vectors, but their clinical use is impeded by the capacity of these delivery vehicles. In addition to these gene editing technologies, RNA-mediated regulation of gene expression is another widely used application for gene therapies. The aim of our work was to investigate the fine tuning mechanisms for gene expression and synthetically engineer bacterial short RNAs to precisely regulate protein translation. We measured the level of the GFP protein fluorescence in E.coli with each sRNA BioBrick we created and have demonstrated that the gene expression level can be sufficiently regulated. Our molecular constructs and approach can be used to regulate the ratio of viral capsid proteins to advance novel gene therapy applications.
https://teams.igem.org/2969	Therapeutics	Microbial therapies possess unique advantages in solving key challenges that are associated with current treatments. Our Ark.micro is a universal platform for microbial therapies with safety and efficiency, allowing the easier engineering of new generation therapies. For metabolic disorders like phenylketonuria, our Ark.micro can support the Phe-metabolizing enzymes to compensate genetic defect. For diseases which require for a long-term drug-supply like Parkinson's disease, it can consistently provide L-dopa to free the patients from bothering taking pills frequently. Further, our therapeutic bacteria can precisely respond to the temperature change using our high-performance thermosensitive switch. Thus, they can be engineered to only survive and release drug under certain temperature condition, avoiding potential risks from unexpected bacteria distribution or negative side-effect of the drug. By the assistance of our hardware, a small electronic gut capsule, which can restrictively heat the lesion part, we consider our Ark.micro to be a promising anticancer platform.
https://teams.igem.org/2970	WIKI	Engineered genetic circuits have reached high complexity levels. These developments require transformation with more than one plasmid which in turn demands the simultaneous use of different antibiotics. Our aim is to enable transformation with multiple plasmids and just one antibiotic to minimize side-effects. In our study we describe a novel RNA-based approach that allows for selection of several plasmids with only one antibiotic. The strategy is based on toehold switches that easily and reliably introduce a complex AND-logic to our design, thus enabling the selection of bacteria with all required plasmids. Our new method shows clear advantages: it increases cell growth and decreases stress, pushing forward the boundaries of synthetic biology.
https://teams.igem.org/2971	Energy	The increasing stress on the environment demands new innovative technologies to satiate the growing energy needs of our society. The aim of our project is to create a system that can harvest energy from the sun by utilizing genetically-modified Escherichia coli. The E. coli are made to produce lycopene by expressing three enzymes from the extremophile Deinococcus radiodurans. Lycopene, an intermediate in the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway, is a conjugated compound that can be excited by specific wavelengths. By coating the lycopene producing cells in TiO2 we can use them in a dye-sensitized, biogenic, photovoltaic device. The material used for these solar cells would have a significantly lower cost of production compared to current solar panels, and with the addition of other pigments could absorb a wide spectrum of light for the production of electricity. We hope that this system will complement other renewable energy sources in the future energy market.
https://teams.igem.org/2972	WIKI	Engineering microbial cells to produce fine chemicals is a sustainable and environmental-friendly way. However, low yield from microbial production hinders its industrial application. Resources within microbial cells such as carbon-source from cell medium are utilized both for cell-growth and product-synthesis. Traditional ways to balance cell-growth and product-synthesis involve using inducers to initiate product-synthesis, which is time-consuming and expensive for large-scale production. To allocate resources for increased yield and decreased cell-medium cost, we have developed an intelligent system Achieved Transcription Management(ATM), which allocates intracellular transcriptional resources to growth-related genes in early stages of fermentation and switches them to product-related genes after a high cell density is achieved. Under guide of mathematical models, the proper cell density is responded by QS circuit expressing genes &#963;-factors and T7-RNA-polymerase. Them control transcription of exogenous genes to produce lycopene. ATM system is self-responsive and could replace inducers to lower cost of fermentation and manual inspection.
https://teams.igem.org/2973	Diagnostics	Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the 10 deadliest diseases worldwide, causing around 1.3 million deaths in 2017 and nearly 3 million people are left undiagnosed, each year. Once Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which causes the disease, dies in a patients lung, it releases DNA fragments into the blood that eventually appear in urine. We developed a diagnostic test that detects these fragments by targeting the specific gene IS6110. After 4 rounds of amplification including isothermal amplification, in vitro transcription/translation of a toehold switch and a colorimetric readout enabled by b-lactamase, the results can be visualized with a naked eye. Our design can be easily implemented for several diseases due to its universality and modularity. As TB is a leading health threat for populations affected by crises, our test is destined to be applied in refugee camps in Greece, as well as worldwide, making a step towards achieving universal health coverage.
https://teams.igem.org/2974	High School	Soil-transmitted helminthiasis infects 1.5 billion people globally. The prevalence and persistence of parasitic worm infections stem from poor sanitation infrastructure and a lack of affordable diagnostic tools. LABYRINTH, a helminth detection system, implements low-cost hardware devices, biosensor toehold switches, and software analysis to diagnose helminthiasis. Using Caenorhabditis elegans as a model organism for infectious helminths, LABYRINTH isolates and lyses helminth eggs using a frugal filter and homogenizer. Biosensor cells detect C. elegans by targeting the lin-4 gene with an RNA toehold switch. If transcribed, the toehold switch activates GFP expression, indicating the presence of helminth eggs in the sample. The FluoroCents app quantifies fluorescence and maps this data onto a cloud-based service, enabling health organizations to efficiently allocate targeted anthelmintic medications. LABYRINTH has the potential to improve the quality of life for over a billion people worldwide by illuminating the chronic nature of helminthiasis and increasing the affordability of diagnostics.
https://teams.igem.org/2975	Village	The presence of nickel in cheap jewelry can often lead to allergic contact dermatitis, involving redness, dry patches of skin, and even blisters. Furthermore, nickel is prevalent in everyday items, such as eyeglass frames, coins, or zippers. With nickel being so common, a proper nickel detection method is important for those with nickel allergies. To address such issues, we will engineer and characterize E. coli for nickel sensitivity using the rcn promoter. The 2011 Lyon Biosciences team previously used this part in a cobalt detecting project, and they noted its nickel detecting ability. However, the nickel aspect of the part has not been characterized in the iGEM competition. Therefore, we hope to contribute meaningful characterization data for the rcn promoter while engineering nickel sensitive E. coli.
https://teams.igem.org/2976	Therapeutics	Tuberculosis is the leading cause of death from an infectious agent. Since conventional methods are more and more difficult to deal with this disease, we put forward a new therapeutic strategy for treating Mycobacterium Tuberculosis (Mtb) infection based on Immune-like cells. In our project, Toll like receptor (TLR) 1/2 and CD14 molecules were expressed on the surface of HEK 293 cells to recognize specific antigens of Mtb. Then, stimulation of TLRs lead to the activation of downstream NF-&#954;B signaling pathway. The NF-&#954;B induced promoters were designed to express granulysin and microRNA hsa-let-7f to respectively eliminate Mtb in blood circulation and macrophages. In order to deliver microRNA into Mtb-infected macrophages, modified cells secrete targeted exosomes containing microRNA after being stimulated with Mtb. In the future, by replacing TLRs and downstream effectors, our "immune-like cells" could target different pathogens, thereby serving as a novel infectious disease treatment strategy in post-antibiotic era.

https://teams.igem.org/2978	Therapeutics	DiffEASY seeks for the creation of an innovative method to treat Clostridium difficile infection. This bacteria is an opportunistic pathogen with a broad antibiotic resistance and increased fitness. In Costa Rican hospitalarian system, C. difficile is considered an endemic disease. Current treatments against this bacteria are based on the use of antibiotics or faecal transplants. The latter, potentially disgusting for patients. As for the antibiotics, only few are effective and, after treatment, patients can present a recurrent infection. Therefore, there is an urge to find alternative treatments to CDI. We propose a system based on the insertion of genetic constructs into Lactobacillus casei, which will act as a probiotic. This organism will be engineered to acquire the capacity to receive a virulence signal (characteristic of C.difficile quorum sensing) and give as response the secretion of a highly specific lysis protein, avoiding the problems and displeasure of current treatments.
https://teams.igem.org/2979	Open	This year we are exploring the area of DNA data storage. We built a model of the in vitro process from DNA synthesis to sequencing to get a quantitative understanding of errors introduced in DNA information channel, and tried to use hierarchical primer and omega primer in PCR to provide flexible retrieval mechanism. On the basis of these, we developed program running in silico for data encoding and encryption with improved fountain code and chaotic encryption, image similarity and hierarchic retrieval with CNN and PCA, and file indexing and modification. To demonstrate our design, we synthesis 12K DNA sequence into which we encode Tsinghua Bamboo Slip, quotes from Assassin Creed and other contents(130KB in total). Integrating multiple parts of our project, we also built a software to simulate the whole DNA data storage system and tell people what's happening with animation.
https://teams.igem.org/2980	New Application	Cellular compartmentation is critical for highly efficient and organized intracellular activities, yet artificial control of cellular compartments for catalysis or signaling remains challenging. This year, PhASE creatively utilized light-inducible phase separation as a switch in E.coli to redistribute biomolecules into compartments called phase in a spatio-temporal manner, in order to manipulate cellular activities. We demonstrated two applications of PhASE: Firstly, by driving enzymes and substrates in and out of a phase, we could control the overall efficiency of enzymatic reactions. Secondly, since some proteins only phase-separate at one end of a cell, we explored the potentiality of this system for cell heterogeneity induction with high time resolution. Additionally, we tried to explain the pattern of phase formed in E.coli using morphologically engineered cell lines. We anticipate our work to be a novel approach to modifying intracellular activities in E.coli.
https://teams.igem.org/2981	Diagnostics	Clinicians require a simple quantitative method for the detection of both phenylalanine and tyrosine to facilitate the diagnosis of phenylketonuria, a common inherited disorder of amino acid metabolism.In our project, we designed a biosensor with RFP&GFP as a reporter gene to semi-quantitatively determine the amount of Phe&Tyr. But RFP&GFP require specific instruments to measure, so we use blue pigment protein (amilcp) and yellow pigment protein (fwyellow). By mixing the two proteins in different proportions and then using a computer for analysis, a simple color chart is created as a new reporting system.
https://teams.igem.org/2982	High School	Polyethylene terephthalate, PET, formed by condensation and polymerisation of terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG), is one of the most commonly used polyesters in the world. The degradation rate of PET is significantly slow which make them extremely persistent and hard to dispose. Although PETase can biologically degrade PET, the rate of enzymatic reaction is not suitable for usage in plastic waste treatment. Therefore, creating mutants which have a higher PET degradation activity may represent an effective and a long term solution of pollution from PET. After structural studies of PETase and its mutants, we hypothesized a more hydrophobic surface and narrower substrate binding site could lead to an increase in activity due to a better substrate interaction with PET. In our study, four single or double PETase mutants are produced and their PET degrading capacity are measured by enzyme activities for para-nitrophenol (pNP)-aliphatic esters.
https://teams.igem.org/2983	Manufacturing	Fat is not so bad. In fact, it can be fab! Fatty acids were primordial constituents of the earliest cell and continue to play key roles in all cellular life today. It is not surprising then that fatty acids, particularly unsaturated ones (think omega), are widely used in the pharmaceutical, agrifood and cosmetic industries. However, their large-scale production is giving rise to many environmental challenges, especially as our planet faces the threat of climate change. Our team is interested in the production of medically-relevant Conjugated Linolenic Acids (CLnAs), which is a class of rare fatty acids with three conjugated bonds. In this project, we develop a launchpad for their bioproduction using the oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica, a powerful chassis organism, whose metabolism is naturally poised for lipid production.
https://teams.igem.org/2984	Village	Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a unicellular algae with promising prospects for synthetic biology. Its ability to grow photoautotrophically makes it an ideal chassis to tackle a variety of problems in an environmentally friendly way. Our goal is to adress the worldwide problem of plastic pollution by creating a catalogue of genetic parts for C. reinhardtii that can enable the algae to degrade PET plastic. By combining different functional genetic parts we plan to address the problem from multiple perspectives. To do so, we are designing and building a reproducible low-budget cultivation setup which will aid us and others in the process of collecting data of algal growth under the influence of transgenic constructs and other parameters. Our overall goal is to try and show the possibility for using C. reinhardtii as a versatile tool for dealing with a complex problem such as plastic pollution from different perspectives.
https://teams.igem.org/2985	Manufacturing	We have found one of the strongest surfactants, which is called surfactin, and its great value in oil displacement. In order to produce surfactin industrially, we modified Bacillus subtilis 168 by knocking out competition pathways, replacing promoters and enhancing resistance efflux genes.
https://teams.igem.org/2986	Village	Accurate manipulation of mammalian cells' behavior remains challenging, because mammalian cell processes a complex multi-level network of gene expression regulation and protein transportation. To better understand this network and actualize precise manipulation, we raised three essentials as a "controlling hoop" on the mammalian cells. First is to effectively switch the input and to visualize the output of the whole regulation network, thus we transfected into HeLa cell a light-switchable transcriptional factor "LightOn" (2012, X.Wang et al) to control cytokine gene expression (input) in and we applied a microfluidics chip to directly observe the cell migration triggered by the cytokine expression (output). Second is to prevent the cell-cell variation during the experiment, hence we designed a automatic illumination and sample collection system to standardize the various factors in experimental conditions. Third, we calibrated mathematical models from experimental data to design input sequences for achieving desired dynamic range of protein expression.

https://teams.igem.org/2989	High School	Neoantigen is an immunogenic peptide formed by mutations in tumor cells and it is an ideal target for cancer immunotherapy. However, natural neoantigen is highly heterogeneous and difficult to identify. Here, we designed an artificial neoantigen with high immunogenicity, which could allow tumors to be recognized and killed by the immune system. We named this artificial neoantigen as Trojan horse antigen. In this project, we constructed a Trojan horse antigen expression system: pCDNA6.2-hTERT-HBsAg-EmGFP-miR-HBsAg and a specific activation system in tumor cells: PCDNA3.1(+) - Hulc-CeR-HBsAg. These two systems, which contain cancer-specific promoters and miRNA, form an AND gate for regulating the expression of the Trojan target antigen only in liver cancer cells, but not in normal cells. Then the human immune system will kill tumor cells by identifying Trojan horse antigen-specific.
https://teams.igem.org/2991	New Application	E.coli consumes non-glucose sugars according to a specific hierarchy. We used this hierarchy in our project to monitor the duration of gene expression. To create our tool, we built four plasmidic constructs: each containing a sugar-responsive promoter (pLAC, pSRL, pARA or pRIB) upstream of a fluorescent reporter protein (GFP, CFP, RFP or YFP). With these constructs, we characterized the activity of the promoters in different conditions, varying the medium composition, the concentrations of sugars, the temperature and the pH. It allowed us to build a model predicting the amount of sugar needed in the medium to trigger gene expression at a certain time and for a certain duration. This fundamental tool could be used in a wide variety of fields such as administration of medicine.
https://teams.igem.org/2992	Food & Nutrition	Our project aims to create Clostridium reporter strains that may be used to safely monitor the likelihood of botulinum neurotoxin production in food. Our proof-of-concept studies will use the non-toxic surrogate strain, Clostridium sporogenes, in place of the toxic Clostridium botulinum. This will be modified to produce a volatile reporter  Acetone, under the influence of BotR (the transcription factor that controls production of Botulinum neurotoxin). The amount of acetone produced will, therefore, positively correlate with the amount of Botulinum toxin produced. This volatile solvent will be detected using a self-designed electronic nose, giving an accurate description of the level of toxin that would be produced. The system can then be used to test whether food packaging will support the production of botulinum toxin, serving as proof of concept that reporter-strain technology can be useful in botulism prevention.
https://teams.igem.org/2993	Diagnostics	Imagine that you're so sick that you can't leave your bed. Or that you have anxiety for the doctor or even physical impairments are making it impossible to go to the doctor. You have to take a medical test in order to know what kind of disease your have. We got the solution! Our system works with aptamers that are specific to detect a certain target. The aptamers are bonded to zinc finger targets. The zincfingers are attached to the split TEV enzyme. When the aptamers detect a target, the whole system starts to come together. The two TEV (N and C TEV) will form one TEV enzyme and B-lactamase will become active after TEV has cleaved of the fused inhibitor. If B-lactamase is active, a color change from yellow to red will occur due to activity on the Nitrocefin compound. This means a positive result.
https://teams.igem.org/2994	Village	North Carolina depends on a combination of coal and nuclear power plants for energy production. In recent years, multiple coal ash spills have resulted in the contamination of water with heavy metals. Thermal pollution is a constant issue with both coal and nuclear power generation. Our goal is to improve the quality of North Carolina waterways through increasing awareness of pollution in real-time, protecting humans and aquatic life from toxic heavy metals and rising water temperatures. We will create a solar-powered floating device that will send a signal when it detects a water pollutant. We will use a temperature-sensitive green fluorescent protein to detect changes in water temperature. Cadmium, arsenic, and lead will be detected using metal-sensitive promoters combined with red, blue, or green pigments. When a change in color or fluorescent intensity is detected, the device will send a signal to an app, alerting riverkeepers and local residents.
https://teams.igem.org/2995	WIKI	Despite playing an important role in protecting crops, herbicides can negatively impact the rhizosphere by interfering with root nodule formation. Rhizobia are soil bacteria that form beneficial relationships with agriculturally important legumes. These microorganisms form root nodules and fix nitrogen gas into ammonia, which plants need to grow. Farmers using herbicides that interfere with biological nitrogen fixation need to apply more nitrogen fertilizers. The runoff from these fertilizers causes nutrient pollution. Therefore, we aim to minimize the use of nitrogen fertilizers. To do this, we are engineering Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens USDA110 to have the ability to form root nodules with soybeans in the presence of the herbicide linuron. We hope to confer herbicide tolerance by giving B. diazoefficiens the ability to biologically transform the herbicide and dampen its toxicity. Agriculture is a large component of our community. This project hopes to provide constructive synthetic biology solutions that support current agricultural practices.
https://teams.igem.org/2996	New Application	As a significant tool in biological research, CRISPR's potential has not been fully exploited, and the off-target problems remain unsolved. Concerning this, we aim at optimizing CRISPR system in two aspects: developing in-situ detection of off-target and novel biostorage. The real-time monitor of off-target is basically composed of a lure sequence, derived from off-target possibility predictions with the Markov model, and a quick-response reporter system based on split luciferase. Luminescence is displayed upon dCas9's binding to lure sequence using luciferase complementary assay. Our biostorage is based on CRISPR acquisition. Signal initiates Cas1/2 to insert protospacer into CRISPR array, further moving the predesigned stop codon out of frame and EGFP into the ORF. When applied with Galois fields, information can be stored in binary format with optimal fault tolerance. In summary, our project provides an off-target control and a novel application for CRISPR.
https://teams.igem.org/2997	Therapeutics	Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an emerging global health problem. The prevalence of kidney disease is increasing dramatically and the cost of treating this growing epidemic is an enormous burden on healthcare systems worldwide. Recent research has proved that the accumulation of uremic toxins like p-Cresol due to a failing kidney plays an important role in the worsening of cardiovascular and renal diseases. This year, iGEM NCKU Tainan aims to provide "Oh My Gut", a comprehensive solution to this problem. We are developing an innovative life-saving therapy using engineered bacteria. We will be providing a biotherapeutic that can reduce p-Cresol production in the gut and a simple and cost-effective blood p-Cresol measuring device. Various measures have been taken to maximize biological safety, including gene knockout. With Oh My Gut, we can not only slow down the progression of CKD but also prevent complications and improve the quality of life.
https://teams.igem.org/2998	Energy	In our project BioHydro-Gene, we are using genes from C. reinhardtii bacteria. This are related with the glucose metabolism (the hydrogenase enzyme (Hyd1), ferredoxin, ferredoxin-NADP-reductase (FNR) and the maturation enzymes (HydEF and HydG)) to transform E. coli (DH5&#945;). The genetically transformed strain will be placed on a MFC so that the molecular hydrogen will be used to generate electricity and H2O as a byproduct. In this process hydrogen molecules are generated, some of those, are going to be selected using a specific proton membrane. As hydrogen fuel cells generate energy through the hydrogen redox reaction with atmospheric oxygen, the only byproduct of this process is water, electric power can be generated to manufacture and enhance homes. Through the production of biohydrogen, we seek to generate a source of clean hydrogen fuel to bring electricity to different communities that do not have the technology or support to have this service.
https://teams.igem.org/2999	Therapeutics	Bacterial biofilms present significant medical challenges. A key component of biofilm formation in the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the biosynthesis of the exopolysaccharides Pel and Psl, which are involved in the formation and maintenance of the structural biofilm scaffold and protection against antimicrobials and host defenses. So, we used synthetic biology methods to overexpress the hydrolyzing enzyme that decomposes the corresponding extracelluar polysaccharide in engineering bacteria to destroy the wild type P. aeruginosa biofilm. Since the extracellular polysaccharide hydrolase is an instracellular enzyme and can't be secreted into the extracellular environment, this project designed two protocols to induce the engineering bacteria to cleave, thereby releasing the extracellular polysaccharide hydroalase into the extracellular environment and destroying the wild biofilm. We hope to solve problems of antibiotic resistance caused by biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa in clinical treatment , and provide a new idea for eradication of chronic bacteria infection.
https://teams.igem.org/3000	Village	To this date, many research and developments have been implemented but the primary source of development is still lagging, which is our autoclave. So we developed, steriport, a system that can sterilize and dispense the media within just 8-10 mins. The best thing about our model is that it's very handy in use and also portable. The sterilization is carried out by the action of AMPs such as Lantibiotic nisin-A, AlbB, and sporulation killing factor. These all are mass-produced by the use of chassis Escherichia coli BL21 DE3, and will mainly target on bacteria contaminants. For fungal contaminants, we make use of endophytes extracted from Holy Basil and Indian lilac. The main feature is the Ohmic heating and UV type C (inactivate or kill the contaminant). While, UV-C effects on human skin aren't harmful, but only irritable to the eyes, for that reason, we coated our UV chamber with acrylic.
https://teams.igem.org/3001	High School	Although present antibiotics are credited with improving the health of millions, antibiotic-resistant bacteria are a great threat to human health. Additionally, current antibiotics can cause harm to the human microbiomes due to delayed or misdiagnosis. Therefore, alternative detection methods and antimicrobials should be investigated. We propose the use of a CRISPR-Cas13a system for rapid detection and specific targeting of pathogens. CRISPR-Cas13a can target and cleave a strain-specific RNA sequence. The cleaving of the target RNA sequence will initiate non-discriminant cleavage of surrounding non-target RNA. Our system will report the presence of a pathogen by a visible colour loss due to the collateral cleavage of fluorescent RNA Mango. Furthermore, our alternative antimicrobial will consist of an engineered phagemid that encodes for the CRISPR-Cas13a system, which when inserted into a chosen bacteriophage can then infect pathogenic bacterial cells in the human body; thereby destroying the targeted bacteria through collateral RNA cleavage.
https://teams.igem.org/3002	Village	Plastic pollution is threatening life in all environment niches on this planet. We are taking action to save our planet by developing a biological recycling method for PET, a major plastic component. By inserting the genes for PETase and MHETase into the green algae, C. reinhardtii, we enable the degradation of PET into its monomers. These will be purified and used for resynthesizing PET. Our Bio-enzymatic environmentally friendly recycling method has a lower energy consumption in contrast to conventional recycling methods that rely on high pressure and temperature. Our approach allows the resynthesis of virgin PET, thereby maintaining the quality of newly synthesized plastics, while eliminating the need for new PET synthesis. We aim for our recycling system to become established in waste management and water treatment centers worldwide. Our Vision is to eliminate pollution of our environment with macro- and microplastic by developing a closed circle economy for PET!
https://teams.igem.org/3003	WIKI	Diabetes is a metabolic disease that affects over 422 million people globally and this number is increasing rapidly. Diabetes results in hyperglycemia due to defects in insulin secretion, insulin action or both. This year the Bilkent UNAMBG team aims to present an alternative solution to diabetes using Living Therapeutics. We plan to engineer a bacterium that will colonize itself in the gut and will secrete single-chain insulin (SCI) analogs when induced. We designed 8 different SCI constructs among which we will characterize and select the most effective analog. These SCI analogs will be displayed on the cell surface via Ag43 autotransporters along with TEV proteases which will cleave the SCI analogs. Cell-penetrating peptides will be fused to SCI analogs to induce penetration through the epithelium of the gut to the bloodstream. We envision an easier and more affordable diabetes treatment with PRISMO.
https://teams.igem.org/3004	High School	Fluoride, in appropriate quantities, is recognized as beneficial for protecting tooth enamel from decay. However, a significant problem arises when excess amounts of fluoride are present in drinking water. Consumption of water containing high amounts of fluoride can contribute to dental fluorosis, which manifests in children as hypomineralization of the enamel. The previous East Chapel Hill iGEM teams had attempted to develop a fluoride biosensor using previously characterized fluoride riboswitches. This system, known as the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase operon (CHOP), allows for the transcription of the antibiotic chloramphenicol acetyltransferase in high amounts of fluoride. Thus, when high amounts of fluoride are present, bacterial growth can be observed in the presence of chloramphenicol. In previous years, we encountered issues forming reliable conclusions from our results when using plating assays. This year, we aimed to develop a more throughput liquid media assay which has allowed for quantitative and more accurate characterization of CHOP.
https://teams.igem.org/3007	High School	The incidence of hyperuricemia and gout have been increasing year by year. Many of the patients are suffering from pain, chronic kidney disease and other complications. Therefore, we hopes to build a bacterium that can detect the concentration of uric acid (UA), which is UA explorer, and a cell that can intelligently remove UA, keeping UA concentration at normal level, which is UA terminator. HucR is a transcriptional factor that senses UA. We combined HucR with the amplifier, Rin-p80&#945;, so that the bacteria could sense the stimulation of uric acid and send signals to us. We also identified the gene downstream HucR operon as uricase gene smUOX-Flag, which degraded uric acid at high a concentration. So far, our UA explorer can sense to UA, and our UA terminator can break down uric acid. In all, our work offers help for defending such diseases.
https://teams.igem.org/3008	Manufacturing	The University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) 2019 iGEM team, Vitrum, is developing a heat-stable vaccine formulation. Our novel approach uses intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) to protect the live-virus vaccine for Newcastle disease. Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is highly infectious among avian species, most notably chickens. This can result in the euthanization of an entire flock to prevent further spread of the disease. IDPs have previously been shown to provide protection for desiccation and heat at the level of organism, individual cells, and isolated protein. In this study, we examine protection of live-virus, potentially relaxing refrigeration requirements for this essential vaccine.
https://teams.igem.org/3009	Foundational Advance	Engineering proteins to enhance their activity or make them acquire new desired properties is a major goal of synthetic biology. Most approaches limit themselves to the 20 canonical L-amino acids. However, their stereochemical counterparts, D-amino acids, harbor an immense potential. When assembled into peptides these cannot be recognized by the cellular machineries, thus evading proteolytic breakdown and immunological recognition. This makes them perfect candidates for therapeutics. By establishing a multitude of tools we empower D-amino acids for synthetic biology. We demonstrate the potency of mirror-image phage display by identifying D-ligands towards a toxin of the multiresistant Staphylococcus aureus. We create finDr, a software to perform this method in silico for any target enabling fast, cost-effective prediction of D-ligands. Alongside chemical synthesis, we implement methods to synthesize, incorporate and detect D-amino acids in bacteria. Altogether, we lay the foundations for advancing the use of D-amino acids in cells or as therapeutics.
https://teams.igem.org/3010	Environment	The plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens (also known as Rhizobium radiobacter) causes millions of dollars of crop damage yearly via crown gall tumors. However, a solution might be within Agrobacterium. We wanted to prevent tumorogenesis using a biomolecule, called curdlan, which is naturally produced by Agrobacterium and exists in the cell walls of plants as structural support. As a possible solution, we synthesized a plasmid that included the machinery to produce curdlan powered by a constitutive virulence promoter. This plasmid was inserted into a lab-grade strain of Agrobacterium that is faster at reaching wound sites then the wild type. When the synthetic Agrobacterium encounters a wounded plant, it will produce curdlan in large amounts. Thus, raising the plants structural defenses. The long-term goal is to utilize synthetic Agrobacterium like a factory to manufacture curdlan at a large scale for farmers, scientists, etc. to apply it.

The current treatment is expensive and comes with serious side effects. We the team iGEM of IISER Kolkata present unLeish, a genetically modified bacterium with a Nitric Oxide sensor that specifically targets the Leishmania-infected macrophages. The sensor is activated only when intracellular NO level falls within a certain concentration range, which is unique to Leishmania-infected macrophages and ensures that our targeted response is specific to these cells only. Further, the sensor activates the expression of a bacterial iron chelator Aerobactin (to reduce iron available for Leishmania) and subsequently stop Leishmanial growth and replication within the macrophage.
https://teams.igem.org/3012	High School	Our project aims to create a platform for precise, light-based control of bacterial cellulose (BC) functionalization for a multitude of applications including burn wound treatment, tissue scaffolding, and air filtration. We will grow Komagataeibacter rhaeticus (K. rhaeticus), a bacterial species that naturally produces BC. We will engineer E. coli to attach fusion proteins via a double cellulose binding domain for functionalization of BC. Levels of functionalization will be controlled with focused light via two optogenetic circuits utilizing red and blue light. By designing and constructing a bioreactor compatible with our optogenetic light control system, we aim to optimize K. rhaeticus growth and BC production by using Raspberry Pi-controlled sensors to monitor our cultures pH, oxygen levels and temperature and developing a method to optimize media conditions. Our project demonstrates a proof-of-concept regarding BC functionalization through the attachment of chromoproteins to the cellulose membrane.
https://teams.igem.org/3013	Environment	Nowadays the problem of microplastics in fluids like drinkable water is a huge topic with a lot of new publications and studies about the amount, types and risks of it for animals, environment and humans. The "Plastractor" is a device which shall extract microplastics from fluids easily via magnets. Therefore the bacterium Rhodospirillum rubrum "magneticum" was obtained. It is genetically modified to build magnetosomes; small magnetic and vesicle-like particles, with plastic binding peptides on its membrane. For modification we use E. coli BW29427 which transfers the needed plasmid to Rhodospirillum rubrum "magneticum" via conjugation. Two different plastic binding peptides are used, "Tachystatin A2" (TA2) and "liquid chromatography peak I" (LCI), fused with two different fluorescent proteins to enable the detection of the bound particles. Thus the device will be able to extract the plastics that are bound to magnetosomes and detect it by fluorescence.
https://teams.igem.org/3014	Foundational Advance	Public interest in sustainable and eco-friendly processes is as high as never before. Given the growing scientific and industrial interest in Vibrio natriegens, we aim to establish V. natriegens as an alternative protein production organism to E. coli while also creating a sustainable, eco-friendly substrate based on microalgae. Our in-silico simulations revealed tRNA availability as a bottleneck in mRNA translation. Our goal was to enhance the applicability of V. natriegens by improving protein expression through increased tRNA availability. To establish a change towards sustainable cultivation of microorganisms, we used CO2 fixing phototrophic microalgae as a base for a climate-friendly substrate. In order to produce an algae-substrate, we cultivated Chlorella vulgaris and Chlorella sorokiniana in a self-built bioreactor. The produced biomass was disrupted, the nutrients were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively and used for cultivation. Using optimized V. natriegens coupled with our climate-friendly substrate we aim to shape the future of biotechnology.
https://teams.igem.org/3015	Diagnostics	Buruli ulcer is a neglected tropical disease which manifests in ulcers and may lead to lasting skin and bone deformations unless detected and treated early. Current diagnostic methods are time-consuming and barely available at the point-of-care in many endemic regions in Africa and the Americas, as they require sophisticated laboratory equipment and highly trained personnel. As a solution, we propose a novel, easy-to-use diagnostic test detecting mycolactone, the toxin excreted by the causative agent Mycobacterium ulcerans, in a patients sample. The molecular mechanism is based on a riboswitch which, in the presence of mycolactone, specifically induces chromoprotein expression in an engineered Escherichia coli strain, generating a simple visual read-out. As an alternative to GMOs, the test may also be used as cell-free system. After expert consultations, an instruction manual was designed to ensure proper and safe use, thus rendering the test a quick and efficient tool for diagnosing Buruli ulcer.
https://teams.igem.org/3016	Manufacturing	Recombinant proteins are widely used in biomedical research and as biopharmaceutical compounds. Even with todays technologies, improved efficacy is necessary as the demand for recombinant proteins is increasing  it has been estimated that within the next ten years half of all medicines developed will be biopharmaceuticals. Our iGEM project introduces VibXPRESSO - Vibrio natriegens with Xtreme PRotein Expression and Secretion Optimization. We harness the gram-negative bacterium's generation time of under 10 minutes to rapidly produce large amounts of protein for efficient purification. This is achieved via the twin-arginine translocation (Tat) pathway, that secretes proteins into the bacterium's periplasm. By environmental modifications we have increased the outer membrane leakiness of V. natriegens, to direct proteins from the periplasm into the growth medium for easier protein harvest. As a proof of concept, we compared the yield of human growth hormone between V. natriegens WT ATCC 14048 and our modified VibXPRESSO strain.
https://teams.igem.org/3017	Village	A core concept of synthetic biology is controlling gene expression, often achieved through inducers and protein repressors to create feedback loops and switches. Our team has combined the CRISPRi system with RNA regulators to achieve a toggle switch. The switch utilizes the catalytically inactive form of Cas9 (dCas9) to achieve targeted and reversible repression of genes via specific single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs). Alternatively, the transcription of antisense RNA (asRNAs) reverses the effect of the dCas9 modulated repression on the desired genes. This method of regulation would allow for the ability to fine-tune and easily customize the execution of highly complex genetic circuits. Using GFP and RFP in our circuit as a proof of concept, RFP is suppressed under the first inducible promoter while GFP is produced. Under the second inducible promoter, the dCas9 is unable to bind to mrfp, derepressing mrfp and suppressing GFP.
https://teams.igem.org/3018	Manufacturing	Indigo is a dye originally extracted from plants, commonly used to dye denim, the use of it dates back 6,000 years. However, plants cannot produce enough indigo for human. To fulfill the expanding demand for indigo, chemical synthesis was developed in the 20th century; this is what we call "the first indigo revolution(IR 1.0)." As time goes by, we come to realize that the new procedure to produce and use indigo is creating too many pollutions. China is the largest indigo supplier in the world, as its environmental law become stricter, local enterprises are facing challenges on the increasing environmental cost. We are trying to use biosynthesis to solve both environmental and cost problems. Based on the work of 2013 iGEM team Berkeley, we have designed an improved biosynthesis pathway to produce indican instead of indigo and trying to demonstrate it in an high-tryptophan-production E.coli strain.
https://teams.igem.org/3019	Foundational Advance	The goal of our project is to develop the autolytic yeast strain beneficial for biotech companies. The use of the strain as a basis for yeast cell factories will ease the extraction of valuable compounds from the cells. Usually, chemical cell lysis method is used but it is quite expensive and time-consuming for large scale production. To achieve our goal, we want to introduce extra copies of the genes encoding for yeast cell wall degrading enzymes (glucanases) and modify some enzymes involved in the cell wall biosynthesis. Initially, we will induce the production of glucanases and downregulate cell wall synthesizing enzymes to make the cell wall weaker and to promote releasing of the cellular content into the media. As a next step, we hope to develop a fully automated system to control lysis of the cells. The lysis will be self-activated at a certain point of the cell lifespan.
https://teams.igem.org/3020	Environment	Radiation or various unknown chemical reagents may lead to genetic diseases. Detection methods based on analytical chemistry and biology are mostly tests for DNA damage products and damaged intermediates. This passive assay does not allow identification and evaluation of the DNA damage capabilities of unknown compounds. We constructe a microbial sensor that can be used to identify oxidative damage reagents. A promoter which is sensitive to oxidative free radicals is screened to respond to the signal and regulate the expression of fluorescent proteins. using ratio of fluorescence to od to judge whether it is an oxidative damage reagent and it's strength. We designed a microfluidic chip with mixing channel and ratchet structure for the culturing and testing,which greatly reduced the amount of experimental operation. We have independently developed a miniaturized instrument based on a small program of smart phone,which is can be used for fluorescence detection and cell morphology observation.
https://teams.igem.org/3021	Village	Our project aims at solving the Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs) water pollution problem. EDC is a collection of chemicals that have long-lasting negative impact on human. EDC exposure is linked to diseases such as cancers and neurodegenerative disorders. Previous studies suggested that laccase can degrade various EDCs. In this project, we used engineered E.coli BL21 (DE3) to produce our selected Laccases. We cloned a collection of Laccases into E. coli, which include a stress-tolerant laccase. To develop a sustainable EDC degradation system, we also added a secretion signal peptide, NSP4 to the laccases expressed in E. coli. Moreover, we also built a green laccase production system. We transformed the laccases, with a PilA secretion signal peptide, into cyanobacteria (Synechococcus sp). In addition, we also designed a water filter that fits our engineered bacteria. All together, we believe that our project can help to find a solution for EDC water pollution.
https://teams.igem.org/3022	Environment	Our team is trying to figure out an innovative way to process the sewage and therefore generate energy for the growth of crops. We develops a simple solo medium-copy plasmid-based polyphosphate kinase (PPK1) overexpression strategy for achieving maximum intracellular polyphosphate accumulation by environmental bacteria. In the inorganic experiments, we will find the suitable concentration of phosphate radical&#65292;pH, and mole ratio of ions involved in the synthetic reaction of struvite. In the engineering experiments, we will design an integrated waste water processing device, which can remove phosphorus from sewage, and utilize the engineered bacterias to release phosphorus in other areas to produce precipitate. In agricultural experiments, we will use our products as fertilizers, and compare them with chemical fertilizers.
https://teams.igem.org/3023	Software	Thermophilicity is a highly desirable protein property relevant for industrial and scientific applications. Predicting mutations needed to convey thermophilic qualities is very difficult which is why our project focuses on developing a neural network which models the thermostability of proteins and finds more heat resistant protein variants. We hope to reduce the amount of lab work necessary to create new proteins with different properties and thereby magnify the possible scope that directed evolution can offer. More concretely, we use existing data from databases like BacDive and train neural networks on around 7 million amino acid sequences to predict the optimal growth temperature of the host organism and then apply different methods to find more stable variants. In parallel to this, a directed evolution approach will be utilized in vitro to find thermophilic variants. Additionally, we will analyse and verify the proteins that the neural network has predicted in the lab.
https://teams.igem.org/3024	Therapeutics	Phage therapy has gained much attention over the last years, utilizing the natural capability of bacteriophages to eradicate harmful pathogens. Nonetheless, it is still far from being available to the general public; mostly due an inconsistent delivery efficiency. Our aim is to provide a new method to deliver temperate phages  this is, phages that have both a lysogenic and a lytic cycle. Harmless bacteria are used as vehicle for phages, which will remain integrated in the bacterial DNA through the lysogenic cycle. Using our genetically modified switch, the lytic cycle is triggered once the vehicle has reached the site of infection, releasing a high dose of localized bacteriophages, ready to infect pathogenic bacteria. Named after the famous microbiologist that discovered the lambda phage, Esther Ledeberg, and as a tribute to all women in science, we have named this new tool for improved phage therapy Esther.

https://teams.igem.org/3026	New Application	A.D.N., or Air Detector for Nucleic Acids, aims at improving air quality control in environments where pathogens control is critical, such as hospitals and nursing homes. The final product will create an all-in-one and easy-to-use device to collect and detect human viral pathogens in the air. Using synthetic biology tools, called Toehold riboswitches, we can identify genetic sequences that show the presence of pathogenic organisms, such as the poxvirus (chickenpox), the norovirus (gastroenteritis) and the measles virus. Our project includes the in silico design of these tools, the experimental proofs of concept and the resulting device. Using theses results, we will produce computational and experimental tools available to the community that will serve research purposes in the field of synthetic biology. Moreover, it will help further the knowledge on aerial viral transmission and contribute to the implementation of air quality control transmission procedures, thus preventing theses potentially deadly nosocomial infections.
https://teams.igem.org/3027	Foundational Advance	DNA constitutes the book of life with all the instructions for survival and proliferation. What could happen without it? This question is at the heart of our project. The void in DNA-less cells led us to invite philosophers and haikus to illustrate our thoughts. Controlled expression of phage nucleases cloned in Escherichia coli generated cells without DNA. Could these dying bacteria host biosynthetic activities? Cells producing a nuclease along with methotrexate-degrading enzymes broke down this toxic anticancer drug showing that DNA-free cells could be used for bioremediation. In another attempt to repurpose DNA-free cells, we infected them with an RNA phage and could observe its proliferation, suggesting that our DNA-less cells may have transiently resembled cells that once thrived in the RNA world, i.e. cells where the replicating genetic information was carried by RNA instead of DNA. Our work opens interesting avenues in developing new kinds of DNA-free synthetic organisms.
https://teams.igem.org/3028	Diagnostics	Each year around 500,000 Lyme disease cases caused by tick-borne Borrelia spp. are reported worldwide. Prompt detection of Borrelia infection is crucial for effective treatment. Quick point-of-care detection of the pathogens in an extracted tick is therefore important. To solve this problem, our team proposes a portable biosensor device that can detect the presence of Borrelia spp. in ticks - LymeExpess. It comprises tick homogenization followed by detection of pathogen-specific DNA motifs. The detection is based on using specially engineered dCas proteins from various organisms fused with split domains of beta-lactamase. The dCas complexes target the complementing split domains to the nearby DNA locus allowing for the fully functional reporter protein to be formed. The products of the colorimetric reaction catalyzed by the protein are detected with an embedded spectrophotometer. This yields an easy to use, cost competitive and quick testing device that can be used even in field conditions.
https://teams.igem.org/3029	Environment	Though earth has been suffered from global warming, the strategies for moderating the phenomenon are still lacking. On the other hand, as it has been suggested that the effects of Dimethy-sulfide-derived aerosols provide a global climate feedback loop for climate cooling, while marine coccolithophore was found to produce dimethyl sulfide for forming cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and accelerate clouds formation. Accordingly, we engineered a bacterial to express a novel DMS producing pathway to make clouds. We also optimize the system to let the bacterial performs carbon fixation capability. Making clouds out of engineered microbe could have better performance than algae do. We expect that this can efficiently release the tension of global climate extremes and solve the problem of water deficiency and dramatically cooling atmospheric temperatures as well.
https://teams.igem.org/3030	Therapeutics	exoCar is designed to apply mRNA-contained exosomes to alleviate the symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases, since the early treatments are limited due to the difficulty in diagnosis of specific clinical subgroups. At the early stage of neurodegenerative disease, the overstimulation-led neuronal injury, or excitatoxicity has an high risk to induce degeneration of neurons. In the extracellular matrix of CNS, the uncontrolled over-high concentration of glutamate, as a primary excitatory amino acid neurotransmitter, is common in the cases of neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, we chose an mRNA which codes the glutamate transporter that generally expressed on the surface of mammals glial cells, the Excitatory Amino Acid Transporter 2 (EAAT2), to be enclosed in exosomes, which are designed to carry the therapeutic cargo to pass the BBB. The EAAT2 will be translated in the glial cells, and increase the efficiency of glutamate clearance as a useful method in the early treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.
https://teams.igem.org/3031	High School	Koi fish (Cyprinus rubrofuscus) are familiar ornamental fish synonymous with Asian culture and possessing huge decorative appeal globally for their many aesthetically pleasing varieties. Similar to other high-density fish farming and breeding operations, these picturesque fish have increased exposure to infectious disease. One particularly disruptive disease is Koi herpes virus disease (KHVD) caused by the highly pathogenic Koi Herpes Virus (KHV) also called cyprinid herpes virus-3. Mass mortality in Koi results from infection. Our project aims to develop an easy to administer vaccine against this virus. Our plan is to engineer live bacterial vaccines that will be administered to fish through the oral route. We will develop and engineer systems that allow bacteria to produce antigens only upon arrival in the iron-deficient environment of the fish gut. While we will also design a system to allow bacteria to present the antigen on the cell surface to illicit the immune response.
https://teams.igem.org/3032	Foundational Advance	Synthetic biology aims to design cellular functions rationally. This goal often requires a signal input and for that chemical inducers are mostly used. However, chemical effectors are not optimal as they might cross-react with other pathways, be toxic, work with a delay, and are usually irreversible. In contrast, light-inducible systems are minimally invasive; also, the signal is delivered quickly and in high resolution. These features open new possibilities in research on how protein expression dynamics affect the operation of a synthetic circuit. To realize the potential of optogenetics in bacteria, we have created a three-level light-controlled system for dynamic bacterial control. It includes (1) a repressor based tool for tight transcriptional control, (2) a way to control steady-state protein levels by light-activated degradation, (3) a framework to maintain different plasmid copy numbers in bacterial growth and production stages. Thus Colight provides an innovative approach for real-time bacterial control.
https://teams.igem.org/3033	Environment	The project SANCE targets on the nanoparticle pollution, an unneglectable issue facing by coast-line cities including Macau. We aim to engineer a controllable nano-/micro-particle collector microorganism. We hypothesize that our modified E.coli bacteria expressing the adhesive(sticky) fusion protein on its cell surface would be able to collect the nano-/micro-particle targets, through which, we will be able to help solving the current issue of excessive suspended solids in Macau wastewater treatment process. Our team also plans to largely engage in public by holding various outreach activities, including local wastewater treatment plant visiting, social survey and interview experts from other universities, university workshop, summer camp engagement and high school lecture. Meanwhile, we plan to collaborate with other iGEMers through symposiums, university visiting and lab work collaborations. Through this project, we aim to achieve a more efficient nano-/micro-particles elimination technique and thereby enhance the awareness of Macau residents in water resource protection.
https://teams.igem.org/3034	Environment	According to the survey, 79% of households have expired drugs. In areas where waste sorting is carried out, expired drugs are classified as hazardous waste, and the treatment methods are still landfill and incineration, which still pollute the environment. In areas where waste separation is not implemented, expired drugs are treated together with household waste, and the damage to soil and water can not be ignored. The presence of expired drugs in sewage can lead to increased antibiotic resistance of many microbial strains in sewage. How to effectively treat expired drugs has become a problem that needs to be solved. Therefore, we designed an expired drug recycling bin, taking the most commonly used antibiotic ciprofloxacin as an example, using engineering E. coli to degrade expired drugs into environmentally friendly substances, and then using mathematical modeling to design points in the city to form an expired drug solution.

BioMaster is dedicated to contributing a complete and comprehensive database, which is essential for the Gene-CAD. BioMaster integrated databases such as UniProt, STRING and GO on the basis of iGEM Registry to provide more comprehensive BioBrick information. Based on the version 1.0, BioMaster 2.0 has significantly stridden in three aspects: data integrity, searching accuracy and user friendliness. We doubled our main reference databases by adding KEGG, BRENDA and other enzyme-related databases. Considering the feature of sequence annotation, we adopted filtering strategy with novel model to enhance the accuracy of mapping among databases. In addition, we redesigned and reconstructed the website architecture and database structure, and established a weight algorithm for searching results recommendation. All endeavors make BioMaster 2.0 a more integrated and more user-friendly database, which provides synthetic biologists with stable data updating and search services in the long term.
https://teams.igem.org/3036	WIKI	Obesity has become an increasingly severe health problem globally. While its relation to various diseases has been constantly discovered, few countries have succeeded in harnessing the deterioration of the problem. This year, BNU-China proposes to develop a synthetic intestinal microbe which promotes leanness by enhancing catabolism of both assimilated and unassimilated fat using two combined synthetic pathways, one leads to overproduction of acetic acid, which as a signal, promotes consumption of white fat tissue; the other enhances &#946;-oxidation of excessive higher fatty acids consumed by human, which would otherwise be absorbed. A bilateral switch is put in control of the pathways, conferring the microbe an exquisite trait to express either pathway at an optimal time according to the changing chemical environment inside digestive track. Additionally, two safety modules are introduced: one enables the host to terminate the engineered bacteria whenever they want; the other prevents contamination of the outside environment.
https://teams.igem.org/3037	Diagnostics	The identification of specific DNA sequences is needed in many contexts. Its applications range from testing for genetic diseases or viruses that integrate into the human genome to checking for the presence of antibiotic resistances in pathogens. Current state of the art methods are expensive, slow and require advanced technologies, which make genetic testing only accessible to researchers and not to most of humanity. We aim to provide a tool for detecting any nucleic acid sequence of interest from microbial samples and human cells. By combining a novel DNA extraction method with a newly designed fusion protein, it will be possible to obtain a visual color readout within minutes, which will indicate the presence or absence of the sequence of interest. Our method is designed to be utilized in the field, meaning it will be cheap, fast and easy-to-use and will not require any advanced technologies or electricity.
https://teams.igem.org/3038	Manufacturing	Have you ever wondered how important the natural pollination of plants is? Nowadays, a lot of edible plants and food producing plants rely heavily on the pollination, tying the diversity of our diet to the well-being of pollinating species. But these species, and specifically bees, are threatened by a new predator in France and Europe: Vespa velutina nigrithorax, better known as "Asian hornet". This predator slaughters European bees population, and there is no efficient ways of fighting against it without compromising the environment. At To Bee... Hornet to Bee, we designed a new metabolic pathway, integrated in bacteria to produce specifically attractive molecules for the Asian hornet. These molecules could then be used in every kind of hornet traps, making them specific to the Asian hornet.

The 2019 University of Exeter iGEM team is developing a microplastic filter which captures and degrades PET microplastic fibres released from household washing machines, using bioengineered PETase and MHETase enzymes. The PETexe filter will be either attached externally or housed within washing machines, preventing the fibres from entering our water systems and oceans. The fibres will be broken down by these enzymes and release two environmentally benign byproducts terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethelyne glycol (EG). The final filtration system will include an enzyme delivery mechanism to release a concentrated enzyme solution onto the microplastic fibres to break them down before washing the byproducts away prior to the next washing cycle.
https://teams.igem.org/3040	New Application	Recently, excessive fertilization has become easier than fertilizing too little since the low price of synthetic fertilizer. Applying excessive fertilizer of crop requirement will harm crops and soil, moreover harming the environment and human health. Our project is aimed to give a solution to current agriculture problem. The two main problems we will solve are the lack of labor force in agriculture and over fertilization. Therefore, FarFarmIA ( Far Farm Intelligence Agriculture ) is designed. FarFarmIA is a smart farming system that contains two major product, the smart fertilizer and the IoT robot. Smart fertilizer can provide nutrition of crop requirement under different temperature and automatically fertilize the crops. On the other hand, IoT robot could provide real time detection on the soil texture, analysis the texture data and can help manage the farm land. By FarFarmIA, farmers can reduce the labor force demand and grow the crops better.
https://teams.igem.org/3041	Manufacturing	Severe burn wounds constitute a major public health problem causing 300,000 casualties annually. Besides fatalities, 11 million victims are hospitalized, of which many are left with lifelong disfiguration and disabilities. Donor skin, used in current treatments, is scarce due to specific characteristics and many processing steps leading to high demand for alternative treatments. One interesting alternative is the use of a novel biomaterial recently found in the Humboldt squid suckerin protein. Suckerin assets unique features such as flexibility, strength and ability to self-assemble into &#946;-sheets, making it ideal for hydrogel formation. Since molecular engineering enables cheap, fast and high-yield production within microorganisms, we thrive to produce a suckerin-based hydrogel as a donor skin substitute. Introducing a linker system enables the joining of antimicrobial peptides, numbing agents and wound healing stimulators. Therefore, our suckerin-based hydrogel can improve the prognosis for burn wound victims by both preventing infections and promoting skin healing.
https://teams.igem.org/3042	Environment	Coral bleaching, the loss of algal symbionts necessary for reef survival, is a disastrous global environmental issue. Though no single factor has been established as the cause, a solution may involve genetically modifying the symbiotic microalgae, Symbiodinium. We are optimizing culturing techniques for Symbiodinium microadriaticum and Oxyrrhis marina (model organism). We designed a codon-optimized red fluorescent protein part that was cloned into a dinoflagellate-optimized expression plasmid (DinoIII)(Sprecher, et. al 2019) for transformation into O. marina as a proof of concept. In parallel, we are attempting to replicate the only known successful transformation of Symbiodinium using Agrobacterium tumefacien carrying a binary vector, pCB302-GFP-MBD (Ortiz-Matamoros et. al 2015), and developing electroporation protocols. A genomic analysis of clade D, a clade associated with higher bleaching resistance but diminished coral growth, will identify target resistance-related genes for transformation into a favorable clade. Corals will uptake the modified algae, increasing their resistance to bleaching.
https://teams.igem.org/3043	Village	More than anything, the goal for our project was education. Genetic engineering is an incredible tool. However, it is often met with misunderstanding. We wanted to make genetic engineering more approachable. What better way to demystify the topic than by presenting it through familiar magic? Our plan is to develop a "House Cup", straight out of Harry Potter. We plan to develop four strains or "houses" of E. coli that secrete distinct quorum sensing signaling molecules. Another strain would then have receptors for each signaling molecule. In response to each signal, it would fluoresce a corresponding color. The House color most expressed wins the Cup! We are then presenting genetic engineering projects to several different groups to survey public knowledge on the topic. This will better our approach in providing pertinent information. Making genetic engineering approachable will ideally help anyone to make informed decisions about its place in our world.
https://teams.igem.org/3044	Therapeutics	In 2050, the number of deaths caused by infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria is predicted to exceed that of cancer (ONeill, 2014). Existing therapeutic strategies cannot keep pace with the rapid progression of antibiotic resistance. To combat this challenge, innovative approaches must be developed. In collaboration with our local hospital, we have designed a plasmid-based CRISPR/Cas-system targeting antibiotic resistance in pathogenic strains of E. coli. This system is delivered using an E. coli vehicle, which transfers the plasmid to the target in the gastrointestinal tract by bacterial conjugation. Thus, our system can be used to sensitize pathogens to antibiotics. We believe that antibiotic resistance cannot be resolved by scientific solutions alone. Therefore, we aim to provide future generations with tools to creatively solve this global challenge. For this purpose, we have collaborated with students and teachers to develop a 5E model-based teaching material to supplement the Danish high school curriculum.
https://teams.igem.org/3045	High School	In a previous project we developed a simple and cost-effective plant-based method for production and purification of recombinant proteins. The system was based on the production of GBSS::TP plants transiently expressing a target protein (TP) fused to granule-bound starch synthase (GBSS) containing a unique cleavage site recognized by a specific protease that enables the TP to be separated from the GBSS into an aqueous buffer, while the GBSS remains embedded the starch granule. The cleaved TP can be highly purified upon a single and simple centrifugation step of protease-treated plant tissues. The aim of this project is to improve the technology by producing plants stably expressing GBSS::TP that are capable of growing under challenging conditions of low gravity, high irradiance, etc. occurring in extra-terrestrial environments. The project involves the collaboration with the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC).
https://teams.igem.org/3046	Foundational Advance	Our modern world depends upon the production of enzymes and biopharmaceuticals from microorganisms. Some of the most important, yet underappreciated, of these organisms are filamentous fungi. Despite their biological and economical value, the genetic toolbox for filamentous fungi is underdeveloped, something that must be addressed in order to use them as efficiently as common model organisms such as Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Therefore, we have taken it upon ourselves to develop a library of synthetic promoters that offers rich choices for stable, predictable, and tuneable expression at various scales, from the microtiter plate to the industrial fermenter, across the Aspergillus genus. These promoters are based on sequences from all publicly available Aspergillus genomes and modelled through a procedure that can be replicated by others for any taxonomic group. Furthermore, we have included a variety of standard parts for Aspergillus niger, thus expanding the possibilities for future iGEM teams.

https://teams.igem.org/3048	Diagnostics	Our team chose to take a harm reduction approach to address the opioid crisis affecting Canadians by building an opioid biosensor in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that can be used to test non-opioid recreational drugs for opioid contamination prior to consumption. We intend for the system to ultimately activate a transcription factor that will turn on production of a chromoprotein, producing a visible color in the presence of opioid. Since the signaling pathway used is anticipated to generate tremendous signal amplification as it passes through the endogenous machinery of yeast, we expect to be able to detect trace amounts of opioid contamination. The development of a biosensor that is capable of detecting small amounts of a variety of opioids in what is believed to be a non-opioid drug sample will allow users to modify their behaviour, whether this includes discarding the drugs, using with others present, or utilizing a monitored injection service.
https://teams.igem.org/3050	WIKI	The conservation of biological diversity is required worldwide, and one measure to achieve this goal would be to confine living genetically-modified organisms in laboratories or plants to prevent them from outgrowing native organisms in environment. If Escherichia coli (E. coli), is endowed with the character of predetermined limited proliferability, such E. coli strain would be very useful for research and development. Here, we designed a system in which E. coli cells lyse spontaneously when they proliferate above certain densities by taking advantage of the mutual inhibition of T7 lysozyme and T7 RNA polymerase. On the other hand, advanced biotechnology cannot be utilized properly when the public does not understand their risk and benefit. As the Information Technology Literacy has become indispensable to everyone, the promotion of Genetic Literacy is now needed. We discussed the importance of Genetic Literacy with high school students by using up-to-date resources we prepared.

We - the Warwick iGEM team - have begun to work towards a biological solution to this growing problem. Outside of the lab, our team have educated the public about the consequences of their everyday actions and have considered the ethical issues and legislation surrounding our research.

The linalool and limonene, which exhibit pleasant aromas, have excellent performance on solving them. Our project focuses on the selective production of linalool and limonene, by construction, verification and modeling of the precursor generation system and light control system respectively. Firstly, glucose was converted to the shared precursor of these two molecules by a precursor-producing plasmid. Secondly, the thermosensitive protein CI and red-light-controlled switching elements in the fragrance-producing plasmid enabled the conversion of the precursor to limonene and linalool alternatively, leading to the synthesis of linalool at night for a sound sleep, while the synthesis of limonene in the morning to remove sleepy mind.

https://teams.igem.org/3053	Therapeutics	We have designed a genetic circuit to detect and specifically destroy multiple target bacterial species/strains containing antibiotic resistance gene using bacteriophage. Our genetic circuit employs two parts. The first part is the antisense RNA to determine the presence of antibiotic resistance gene. The second part is the J protein hopping mechanism. The antisense RNA is used to identify antibiotic resistant bacteria. On detection, a switch to the lytic life cycle of virus results in the disruption of the bacteria and release of more phages. In the absence of resistance gene, lysogenic state is maintained. Normally, a single virus can target a specific bacteria. J protein has been identified to play a crucial role in recognition of its bacterial target. Our system employs alternate promoters controlling the expression of multiple J protein. This allows the virus to have multiple bacterial targets.
https://teams.igem.org/3054	Environment	Our project aims to use synthetic biology to develop a method for bioremediation of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contaminated soil. PCBs are a very persistent group of pollutants that bioaccumulate in the fatty tissues of many animals, and although their use was prohibited long ago they still remain a problem. To solve this, we attempt to engineer Saccharomyces cerevisiae with genes from several bacteria encoding enzymes that are able to both dechlorinate and degrade the compounds. The designed system uses two separate yeast strains, one which can use the enzyme PcbA5 to dechlorinate PCBs and another which hosts eight enzymes from the Bph-pathway which can be used to degrade the biphenyl skeleton. The envisioned implementation of this system would allow us to remove PCBs from both soil and water in an efficient way, ultimately removing this long-lasting problem from the environment.

https://teams.igem.org/3059	Village	Our iGEM project aims to create a toolkit for the precise, controlled design of living biomaterials. Of the many forms of living materials, we have chosen bacterial biofilms due to their ubiquity and outstanding bioengineering potential. Biofilm formation, although frequently associated with deleterious effects, also equips bacteria with emergent properties such as increased resilience, complex signaling, self-repair, and division of labor. Our project harnesses these properties to repurpose biofilms as robust, spatially controlled, patterned, and responsive biomaterials. For robustness, we engineered a library of biofilm-strengthening adhesins, and investigated naturally biofilm-forming bacterial species. To adhere biofilms with precise spatiotemporal control, we incorporated both optogenetic and chemical induction methods. To pattern biomaterials once placed, we utilized the distance-dependent diffusion of quorum signaling molecules and generated Turing patterns that are informed by mathematical modeling. Our biomaterials have immediate applications in wound healing, water and waste treatment, and the creation of next-generation biosensors.
https://teams.igem.org/3060	New Application	Living circulating tumor cells (CTCs) as escaping pioneers of tumor cells in the blood cause cancer metastasis. In order to address the difficulties on recognition, visualization, and capture of living CTCs with high purity and integrity, we construct a multifunctional DNA hydrogel like a prison CELL capsuling CTCs, and defined this new platform as cell in CELL (CiC). CiC contains 3 key components: i) the fluorescence-labeled ssDNA aptamers for specifically targeting the receptors of CTCs and visualizing them; ii) once successfully targeting CTCs, the ssDNA aptamers will expose the sticky end further for triggering the adhesion of sticky-end pairing ssDNA; iii) the pairing ssDNA can induce rolling circle amplification, subsequent multi-primed chain amplification, making the formation of CiC around CTCs. Finally, CiC can enlarge CTC size for centrifugal isolation and meanwhile keep their bioactivity. In this work, we achieve a feasible and economical CiC for clinical CTCs-capture and analysis.
https://teams.igem.org/3061	New Application	Photoautotrophic biological cells are promising actuators to perform transportation and delivery tasks, due to smaller size, power-free and wireless communication. However, motions of these biological cells could not be precisely controlled, and direction-oriented movement has not yet been realized. To make the locomotion of the motile cells in a controlled way, here, we are intended to make the movement of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a unicellular eukaryotic green motile microalga, in a precisely controlled way. The movement of robotize Chlamydomonas is activated by blue fluorescence of Renilla Luciferase in vivo, which was controlled by red light through rational design of PhyB and Pif as signal-trigger. Our work expanded the spectral palette of light to control their motions, which may open a door for site directed-cargo delivery in microorganisms under customized controlled light as a microrobot, and this novel algal guiding system could also be used in biomedical applications in the future.

https://teams.igem.org/3063	Village	Our project utilizes DNA nano-drug carrier (NDC), in combination of engineered Salmonella Typhimurium, in the treatment of liver cancer. In vivo synthesis of DNA NDC is achieved using Murine Leukemia and HIV-reverse transcriptase system in E. coli as developed last year. And the design of nanostructure consists of aptamers targeting nucleolin, cancer stem cell marker (EpCam) and also Salmonella surface antigens. It allows high specificity targeting of DNA NDC, also allowing the utilization of Salmonella as a motile vehicle to regions unreachable by diffusion in solid tumour. Salmonella Typhimurium is engineered to increase flagellar production with flhDC transcription factors, to increase tumour accumulation and motility. It is also used to transport vector encoding artificial miRNAs upon cell invasion, to increase drug sensibility of cancer stem cell. A co-culture system consisting of Salmonella and cancer spheroid culture is used to create accurate 3D tumour modelling, replacing the use of animal model.
https://teams.igem.org/3064	Foundational Advance	Type II diabetes mellitus (T2D) is now one of the biggest threats to human health. Previous studies have revealed the critical contribution of glucagon and glucagon induced hepatic gluconeogenesis in the hyperglycemia of T2D patient. Here we demonstrate a designer cell approach to control hyperglycemia by degrading hepatic Glucagon Receptors (GCGR) in a glycemic dependent manner. We achieved glucose responsiveness by synthetic circuits that couple endogenous CHREBP glucose sensing pathway to a CHREBP activating hybrid promoter controlling GCGR degrading elements. The degradation of GCGR was then executed by proteasome-based system in a Trim21 based, Trim-away alike manner. Circuit-carrying HepG2 cells showed significantly decreased GCGR level and glucogenic ability, similar results were obtained in primary mouse hepatocytes with adenovirus as delivery approach as well. Mathematical modeling also indicated the potentials of this circuit in long-term in vivo uses. This method may provide a promising strategy for T2D treatment in the future.
https://teams.igem.org/3071	Food & Nutrition	Banana Xanthomonas wilt (BXW) is caused by the bacteria called Xanthomonas campestris pv. mussacearum (Xcm) and all the bananas are subjected to this particular bacterial infection. The aim of this project is to develop a simple, laboratory-independent detection device that could be used to identify BXW-infected bananas at early stages. It will be beneficial to limit the infection rate and prevent epidemic spreading across the border. Diffusible signal factor (DSF) is a signal in cell-cell communication, which is also used as the biomarkers of bacteria. Our design aims to detect the DSF specific to Xcm to indicate the presence of this pathogen inside the sample to be tested. By synthetic biological approach, we couple the signaling pathway of RpfC/RpfG in Xcm to the signaling pathway of E. coli. Hopefully, a transformed E. coli can recognize the DSF of Xcm and could show a red chromoprotein positive signal for warning.
https://teams.igem.org/3072	Food & Nutrition	Honeybees are an essential contributor to our food supply. In addition to producing honey, bees pollinate one-third of all plants and plant products we eat. Nosema ceranae is a debilitating fungal parasite that is the most widespread honeybee pathogen in Canada. In addition to the difficulties in treating Nosema ceranae infections&#8288;a problem that Team UAlberta tackled last year&#8288;current detection methods are slow and costly, and infected hives are often diagnosed too late for effective treatment. Team UAlberta is working to change that by developing The Beetector, a field-ready paper-based test for the detection of Nosema ceranae in bee samples. The system is comprised of M13 phage labelled with a chromoprotein and displaying a ligand specific to Nosema spores. Based on the colour intensity of the diagnostic paper strip, the severity of the hive infection can be assessed, thus democratizing diagnosis and facilitating effective treatment of Nosema ceranae.
https://teams.igem.org/3073	Software	The FBA and its further study have been proved useful to make inference about the change of metabolite flux given the objective function so that the factory and laboratory can make targeted improvements to their experiment to increase productivity. There already exist some tools to do FBA, but all with shortcomings: they can't show an intuitionistic graph of the dominant metabolite in the pathway related to the object, they can't compare the modified model with the original one and they can't share with others as well. Foresyn is a user-friendly platform that solved the issues. The neoteric workflow management based on customized database allows users to build their models for flux analysis, get visualized output and easily share with others.

https://teams.igem.org/3075	Village	Paclitaxel is a chemotherapeutic agent used to treat many solid tumour cancers. It is obtained by debarking the yew tree species (Taxus Baccata), or through semi-synthesis from rare precursors in the trees needles. Both of these processes are unsustainable and contribute to the expensive production costs. Our project aims to address this in two ways. First, to enhance the rate of product formation by attaching rate-limiting enzymes of Paclitaxel semi-synthesis onto a hexameric protein scaffold called Assemblase. This spatial arrangement co-localises the enzymes, alleviating diffusion-related limitations of enzyme catalysis. The second component applies Assemblase to make the production of Paclitaxel from common analogues commercially viable. This reduces the need to log the yew tree, and lower reagent costs. In addition, the system allows for the recycling of co-products produced between the two pathways. Overall, our project aims to improve upon Paclitaxel manufacturing to meet the demands of the future.
https://teams.igem.org/3076	Village	Our project is inspired by the household water pollution incident that occurred in Hong Kong in 2015. Aquaponics is a popular way of farming in Hong Kong due to the limit of space. However, the aquaponic system is highly vulnerable to heavy metal pollution due to the bioaccumulation effect. Therefore, this system was chosen as a model for investigation. We previously demonstrated that E. coli itself could remove about 30% of copper pollutants in water after 4 hours. In this project, we aimed to enhance E. coli copper adsorption ability by ectopically expressing CgMT, a Metallotionien from Corynebacterium glutamicum, and knocking out its endogenous copper exporter genes such as cusA, copA, cutA and cusF. In addition, a filtering device was built to utilize the bacteria in the real-life aquaponic systems. Results indicated that the copper level can be reduced significantly (~40% in 2 days) by our bacterial filter device.
https://teams.igem.org/3077	Village	Last year the Hog Kong government announced the construction of facilities to tackle the food waste problem in Hong Kong. However, we noticed that those facilities are only built to solve the industrial food waste problem but not domestic food waste. It left us thinking, is there any way we can solve the problem at home using simple engineering and synthetic biology? We designed composite parts to digest amylase, lipase and produce a more pleasant smell during the process alongside a food waste conversion machine to tackle the modern-day problem in a smaller scale and faster paste.
https://teams.igem.org/3078	Therapeutics	Vulvovaginal candidiasis is an infection primarily caused by Candida albicans that affects millions of women. Patients usually responds rapidly to antifungal azole therapy. However, continuous emergence of relapses and drug-resistant cases is reported. Developing effective approach to improve therapeutic efficacy and reduce drug resistance is urgently needed. In our project, a non-antibiotic and novel strategy with the function of sensing, inhibition and killing C. albicans is generated to improve the therapeutic effectiveness. Sensing system is capable of detecting the signal molecule secreted by C. albicans and initiating the downstream genes. Once triggered, the four individual downstream genes come into therapeutic effect: inhibition of the hypha phase by BDSF, degradation of the hyphae through Msp1, degradation of the biofilm by &#946;-1,3-glucanase, and killing C. albicans with the antibacterial peptide LL37. In addition, the suicide system is added for safety reasons&#65292;which could trigger suicide in the absence of C. albicans.
https://teams.igem.org/3080	High School	We plan on bioproducing safflower dye to replace synnthetic dyes in the industry and reduce chemical waste pollution. We will also be looking to why safflower growth is being reduced in Pakistan.
https://teams.igem.org/3081	Foundational Advance	Many challenges impeding genetically engineered bacteria from benefiting us can be attributed to the growth rate (e.g. infections in microbial therapies) and can be solved if we can better control over it. However, previous methods for growth rate control has many disadvantages: limited application scenarios, cell function disorders, etc. Here, we developed a novel system for precise growth rate control, by using dCas9 to target the DNA replication origin. Such system is highly tunable with multiple inputs, large dynamic range and non-detectable leakage. It functions in a gentle and reversible way without harming cell activities. Furthermore, we explored the potential of replication control in synthetic biology, including control of plasmid copy number and gene expression variation. Finally, we tried to design a safe therapeutic E. coli with high targeting specificity and controllable treatment intensity, promising to reduce the infection risk, which shows the broad application prospects of our system.
https://teams.igem.org/3082	High School	The largest exporter of fish-meal and oil in the world, TASA, is concerned about cadmium in their product. Currently, they employ a multi-day test for cadmium and other pollutants, which directs dilution of their product before shipping worldwide. Our projects goal is to detect cadmium using E.Coli transformed with a sensor gene that turns red in the presence of cadmium. These transformed cells will be implemented into a bio-assay designed to be used by anchovy fishermen on their boats to determine cadmium levels in the fish. This test will allow early detection, saving both time and money in the production line because they will be able to infer cadmium levels in the fish-meal before it is bagged. Thus, TASA will be able to make the dilution process before bagging, a much faster and cheaper process than the current method of tearing open bags and making dilutions post packaging.
https://teams.igem.org/3083	Village	One of the most pressing matters facing the medical community is the growing dilemma of bacterial resistance to antibiotics. Due to their overuse, we have created bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics, and more recently, cases of bacteria that are resistant to multiple antibiotics, so called superbugs, such as Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus(MRSA). They pose an enormous risk to human health in the coming decades. We focused on utilizing the quorum sensing system of S. aureus to build a sensitivity switch, dependent on the concentration of the autoinducing peptide (AIP) that it uses to detect its population density and become virulent and break away from the biofilm. Our system will hijack the system and trigger production of lysostaphin that will specifically target S. aureus and act as a kill mechanism. This system will be able to safely treat S. aureus and avoid perpetuating the problem of creating new resistant species.
https://teams.igem.org/3084	Manufacturing	Traditional biosynthesis platforms such as E. coli and yeast require external energy supplies, commonly in the form of sugars or starch. Besides the economic cost associated with these energy sources, such systems are often not considered durable. Indeed, the production processes of sugars and starch are energy inefficient and farmland intensive. To circumvent these issues, photosynthetic systems like cyanobacteria and algae have been gaining increasing interest for biosynthetic purposes as they require only light and CO2. With our project, OCYANO, we present two new cyanobacterial technologies for protein production. The first design comprises the production and secretion of proteins in an ultra-fast growing cyanobacterium. The second system relies on a cyanophage for the conversion of its hosts biomass to the protein of interest. Along with wet-lab exploration of these platforms, the economic and ecological relevances of both systems were investigated and compared to state of the art biosynthesis platforms.
https://teams.igem.org/3085	Therapeutics	Gemcitabine is a chemotherapy drug used to treat pancreatic, breast, bladder, ovarian, and non-small cell lung cancer. Alabama iGEM explored a previously reported link between the intratumoral bacterial environment of pancreatic adenocarcinoma to confirm and characterize the direct consumption of gemcitabine by comparable bacteria such as some strains of E. coli. It has been shown that the production of a specific type of the cytidine deaminase (CDD) protein by these bacteria render the gemcitabine unusable to treat the target cancer. We constructed a plasmid and used it to knock out the cdd gene from E. coli BL21(DE3), and compared growth of knockout and wild-type strains. Degradation of gemcitabine by the wild-type strain was determined by HPLC. We further developed a suite of modular E. coli expression plasmids, with each plasmid component flanked by a unique restriction site, that will facilitate cloning in the future.
https://teams.igem.org/3086	Foundational Advance	Utilizing bacterial cells for their capacity to serve as computational or memory-like devices has potential applications in fields such as healthcare and biotechnology. Synthetic Cellular Recorders Integrating Biological Events (SCRIBE) uses a reverse transcriptase enzyme to produce single stranded DNA which can be incorporated into the host-genome during DNA replication using the Lambda-Red system which results in a mutation within the bacterial chromosome. This SCRIBE system can be applied to a large population of cells in order to measure the amount of a stimulus by sequencing DNA to quantify the number of times the mutations occur in relation to the entire population. The UF iGEM team seeks to couple the SCRIBE system with the DNA nuclease activity of the Cas9 protein to cut and kill the chromosome of the bacteria with wild type DNA, thereby killing the cells without mutations.
https://teams.igem.org/3087	High School	In iGEM 2017, our team successfully designed a DNA three dimensional nano-structure to detect the presence and concentration of H3N2 influenza mRNA biomarker. To further prove the ability of the DNA nano-structure, this year we used four DNA strands to form a DNA nano-structure to detect the presence and the concentration of Lactobacillus instead of just a gene fragment of a bacterium. We successfully designed nano- triangular bipyramid applicable to the bacterium using Tiamat. We then successfully detect the presence and concentration of bacteria by measuring its peroxidase activity.
https://teams.igem.org/3088	Diagnostics	Diphtheria, a lethal disease caused by the toxigenic strain of Corynebacterium diphtheriae, afflicted Indonesia in December 2017 with 1/10 mortality rates upon 593 national cases. Complicated diagnostic method and ambiguous symptoms were the main obstacles in giving the optimal treatment, according to physicians. Therefore, a fast and convenient novel approach to enhance diagnostic precision is needed to mitigate diphtheria immediately. In regards, our team focuses on developing the diagnostic tool using K-12 chimeric bacteria and green fluorescent protein (GFP) to enable a rapid detection of Diphteria toxin upon binding. This novel technology is claimed to be fast, available, and easy-to-usewhich sets stepping stones regarding to the establishment of primary diagnostic tool for Diphtheria toxin worldwide. In addition, we aim to prevent future outbreaks using public education to enhance awareness regarding anti-hoax movements and introduce daily probiotic consumption to encounter low usages of probiotic in Indonesia
https://teams.igem.org/3089	High School	Waterborne organisms like mussels and barnacles produce proteins which can be engineered into strong, durable underwater adhesives. The mussel foot and the barnacle cement contain several proteins, including MFP1/3/5 and CP19K, which makes them capable of holding onto diverse substrates. These proteins can be combined with CsgA to enhance their adhesive and cohesive function. E. coli and Pichia Pastoris are used as the chassis; Pichia Pastoris can induce higher protein yield and perform PTMs like phosphorylation that makes the proteins more adhesive. Another crucial PTM is the conversion of tyrosine to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine by mTyr-CNK, a tyrosinase with high catalytic efficiency. This modification is performed in vivo and in vitro to determine the optimal condition for the most DOPA content. We believe that our underwater adhesives toolbox will provide a promising space for future synthetic biologists to make advances into, thus unveiling a wide range of applications of these proteins.
https://teams.igem.org/3090	High School	Antibodies are used to treat diseases, but their targets are limited to cell surface receptors because crucial disulfide bonds are broken in reducing environments. scFv(P5) is an example of "hyperstable antibody that maintains its function in reducing environments. We attached Cell-penetrating peptide(CPP) to the N-terminus of scFv(CPP-scFv(P5)) to design hyperstable scFv(P5) that can penetrate the cell membrane. CPP-scFV(P5) was expressed and purified using affinity and size-exclusion chromatography to check if CPP-scFV(P5) binds lysozyme, the target protein. Immunofluorescence(IF) showed CPP-scFv(P5) can penetrate the cell membrane. Through modeling, we grafted CDR regions of anti-Ras antibody to scFv(F8) to make hyperstable scFv that can recognize Ras. We performed homology modeling of engineered scFv using Modeller and showed our model is structurally similar to anti-Ras antibody. Our experiments demonstrate hyperstable scFv with CPP can go into the cell and function in reducing conditions. This opens opportunities for developing antibodies that target intracellular proteins.
https://teams.igem.org/3091	High School	As one of the most common pollutants of fecal-polluted water, somatic coliphage is widely used in various protocols as the indicator of fecal and viral pollution. Our team designed a biosynthetic system that effectively detects bacteriophages in fecal polluted samples by inserting sequences of firefly luciferase and polyphenol oxidase in pET 28a and pET 30a vectors. After adding appropriate substrates to LB medium, enzymatic reactions occur when cell lysis takes place due to phage attack, and expressed enzymes leak from lysed cells to interact with their according substrates. Fluoresce and observable color change of the enzymatic reactions will then be tested and recorded for identification of the samples phage density, and thus the tested samples degree of pollution can be indicated. To avoid false negative responses, our team further inserted sequences downstream to express 2-Phenylethanol, emitting scent which acts as expression indicator that will not hinder luminescence detection.
https://teams.igem.org/3093	Manufacturing	Wastepaper, as a recyclable materials, can be regenerated repeatedly in wastepaper factories. Nevertheless, the pulp fibers will shorten with every recycling processes. When it reaches a certain extent, these pulp fibers will be too hard to be reused. Furthermore, in the current recovery process, the paper quality will degrade if those short fibers are not strictly removed. However, this problem can be resolved. We have developed the Paper Transformer that can manufacture composite materials which can improve the properties of recycled paper when mixed into pulp, by achieving the former decomposition of short pulp fibers and the latter in situ synthesis of bacterial cellulose. Also we will not stop at this, as the excellent performance of our Paper Transformer is far from been restricted within the paper-making industry alone but many industries where electronic paper, artificial skin and many other products are produced.
https://teams.igem.org/3094	Software	With the development of synthetic biology, it is possible to design metabolic pathways and achieve them. Therefore, an integrated platform for pathway construction is needed urgently. Our software, Pathlab, perfectly caters to this demand with accurate and efficient algorithms and open data in the KEGG and BRENDA databases. Considering thermodynamic feasibility, material competition of heterogeneous reactions and toxicity of intermediates, Pathlab constructs an optimal synthetic pathway in E. coli or the yeast which is based on the available substrates or desired products. Meanwhile, the enzyme required for each reaction in the pathway will be selected first according to the physical and chemical properties and the affinity with biological chassis, and then be provided after optimization by codon preference. Moreover, Pathlab provides additional functions, such as word clouds for keywords of pathway-related literature, search engine for promoters and parts used in iGEM&#65292;etc.
https://teams.igem.org/3095	Foundational Advance	Bioproduction, a industrial process that generates useful products through microorganisms, performed in bioreactors and occuring in two main steps: upstream (induction and production of bacterial metabolites) and downstream (isolation and purification). The most common inductor used in bioproduction are expensive chemical compounds (IPTG and arabinose) that lacks in control of what and how much metabolite can be produced. In this way, our goal is to built a genetic circuit that can switch between two different states of activation with just a single input of blue led light and to compare the efficiency between chemical and light inductors by seeing strength and lack. The circuit was built in E.coli and works based on inhibition handles and recombinases, inverting the promoter region according to the presence and absence of the same blue light input, as output fluorescent proteins are used. The project allows a more practical, controlled and economical bioproduction pathway.
https://teams.igem.org/3096	Therapeutics	We are developing E.coli Nissle 1917 as a microbial chassis that produces a drug for the safe treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. The chassis will provide glucose-dependent Exendin-4 secretion, a GLP-1 analogue efficiently increasing insulin secretion and supporting weight-loss in diabetes patients. In silico-confirmed cell-penetrating peptides will be utilized to make the Exendin-4 available in the pancreas. Moreover, a novel CRISPR/Cas3-based kill-switch with environmental-sensing systems will be used for biocontainment of the chassis. To evaluate the robustness of our probiotic strain, our project aims to extensively characterize it via RNA-seq. Finally, the first metabolic model of Nissle is under development. Concerning human practices our project involves various knowledge transfer opportunities, public outreach and data collection, as well as an overt dialogue and intense collaborations with other iGEM teams. Overall, the aim of this project is to overcome the physical, emotional and financial burden of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.
https://teams.igem.org/3097	New Application	Increased background radiation in space causes a significant increase in the mutation rate of bacterial genes which threatens the validity of biological experiments performed in environments such as the International Space Station. K12 derived cell line IR9-50-1 contains genomic mutations to RecN, RecD, and RpoBC which allow it to withstand up to 2500 Gy. CosmiColi will be engineered by introducing exogenous tardigrade derived radiation resistance proteins Dsup and CAHS to IR9-50-1. Our team hypothesizes that CosmiColi will have greater radio tolerance compared to wild type IR9-50-1 and wild type parent strain MG1655. Radio tolerance is tested by comparing the growth and the rate of gain of function mutations in all three cell lines. Growth is quantified by measuring optical density of overnight cultures. Gain of function mutations are measured by the restoration of antibiotic resistance.
https://teams.igem.org/3098	New Application	This year, our team applied synthetic biology to the field of restoration of cultural relics. The aim of our project is to reinforce one piece of extremely precious silk relic, called "Plain Gauze Garment (&#32032;&#32433;&#35148;&#34915;)". We would like to use BC (Bacteria Cellulose) secreted by engineered E.coli to reinforce the fragile area of silk relics. And to realize the accurate reinforcement, we design a light system which is cooperatively used with our hardware to reinforce the areas varying different degrees of fragility in irregular shape. Besides, we plan to assemble AMPs(anti-microbial peptides) and AOPs(anti-oxidant peptides) onto BC via biotin-streptomycin combination and CBD(cellulose binding domain) to realize a functional platform. Our project is meaningful for cultural inheritance owing to reduction of the protection cost and keeping the silk relics in a good condition.
https://teams.igem.org/3099	Environment	Dressed in colorful clothes, humans have been enjoying the benefit of abundant dyes. Among them, azo dyes are the most widely used ones. However, many types of azo dyes are quite difficult to degrade. What`s worse, about 10-15% of the azo dyes in waste water is discharged without treatment. Thus, the degradation of azo dyes has become an urgent problem. At present, physical and chemical treatments have been applied to deal with the azo dyes in waste water. Both of the two ways are suffering from the disadvantages of low decolourization ratio, high cost and additional pollution. Our project focuses on ulteriorly improving the decolourization ability of Shewanella oneidensis by introducing NAT enzyme to help resist the byproduct toxicity and overexpressing electron transfer proteins. Also, we add HXK enzyme into the bacteria to make it possible for it to utilize glucose, which can reduce the cost.
https://teams.igem.org/3100	New Application	Precise and reliable gene expression is critical in fine regulation of gene or pathway expression. Routinely, it always requires library construction to each genetic part, which is costly and time-consuming. Our project has developed a method to optimize the adaptability of multi-gene system in E. coli, with only one library so-called Promoter-Toehold Switches pool. A pool is built where four Toehold Switches are placed under one of 10 promoters that yielding about 10^4 combinations. This pool can simultaneously optimize up to four genes in a system. Particularly, this versatile library can be applied to fast optimization in different systems without having to build ad hoc libraries, which can greatly reduce manpower and costs. Here, we demonstrate the versatility of this approach by using the pool for fine regulation of four genes to enhance the acid tolerant of E. coli.
https://teams.igem.org/3101	New Application	The replacement of animal testing by alternative in vitro methods is encouraged by the World Health Organization and the US Food and Drug Administration. However, this is a challenge for laboratories because current in vitro cell cultures poorly reflect the physiological organization of tissues. This has led to poor clinical translation, because drugs appearing efficient in vitro finally fail during in vivo trials. We believe there is an urgent need to improve in vitro drug testing to better simulate the in vivo physiology of animal models. Therefore, we created a cell culture toolbox called Fluosphera (provisional patent filed) that is capable of measuring the effects of drug compounds on a palette of biological activities with physiological relevance. With Fluosphera, we aim to improve in vitro drug testing by reducing the reliance on animal experimentation, as well as increasing the efficiency and accuracy of drug screening.
https://teams.igem.org/3102	Environment	Cigarette butts represent a major danger for our environment, with one cigarette butt polluting up to 500 liter of water. Thus, our project Cinergy aims to add value to cigarette butt filters, made of cellulose acetate (CA), by producing electricity. The microbial fuel cell used will include genetically modified bacteria, Escherichia coli and Shewanella oneidensis, and be linked to a battery device. This system will contain two E. coli populations: the first one degrading the CA into substrate molecules to produce lactate and the second one producing flavins. These will be used by Shewanella oneidensis to produce a more efficient electrical current. Modified bacteria were produced by transformation process and/or gene knock-out. Cellulose acetate degradation ability was quantified and compared to the original bacteria, Neisseria sicca. Electrical current was successfully produced and measured. Finally, a functional prototype was built and tested.
https://teams.igem.org/3103	Environment	Green Oceans aim is to genetically modify marine cyanobacteria that will enable it to degrade polyethylene terephthalate (PET), most common form of plastic in the oceans. The engineered cyanobacteria harbor PETase, an enzyme that breaks down PET. Our approach is novel because instead of using the traditional e. coli, which may not survive in the ocean environment, cyanobacteria are photosynthetic bacteria that thrive in the ocean. We have modified the prototypical Ideonella sakaiensis PETase gene to be compatible with expression and secretion in cyanobacteria. This engineering was accomplished in a dual-host plasmid shuttle vector in E coli, and then transferred to a model cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus by conjugation.We also developed a PET degradation assay system consisting of fluorescent PET nanoparticles. The degradation of the PET nanoparticles was measured by a variety of imaging and functional assays. We desire to make a change in the world starting with a Green Ocean.
https://teams.igem.org/3104	Undergrad	Our project seeks to improve the cost efficiency of biofuel by increasing the photosynthetic range of productive algae. To do this, we will attempt to introduce genes from infrared-utilizing cyanobacteria into Nannochloropsis Gaditana in effort to boost the amount of energy available for biosynthesis. This project was in part inspired by the recent collaboration between Exxon Mobile and Synthetic Genomics that resulted in a double increase in lipid production by the same algae strain.
https://teams.igem.org/3105	Manufacturing	Lignin is the second most abundant organic polymer on earth. It is heterogeneous, consists of a variety of phenolic groups and is highly branched. Every year the paper industry accumulates approximately 50 Mt of lignin as a waste product, which is immediately combusted. Studies have shown that the potential degradation products and monomers of lignin can be used as building blocks for further applications. This project aims to generate a multi-enzyme system, based on characteristics of wood-decaying fungi, to efficiently process lignin into high-value chemicals. To achieve this, Pichia pastoris is engineered to express horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and aryl-alcohol oxidase (AAO). HRP degrades lignin under consumption of hydrogen peroxide. AAO, in turn, utilises parts of the degradation products to create more hydrogen peroxide, forming a self-sustaining system. Both enzymes are fused with a secretion tag to create a continuous cell factory, where the supernatant contains the desired enzyme mixture.
https://teams.igem.org/3106	Village	In RubisCO, we are thinking of new ways in which we can manage the waste we put in the environment through the gas and wastewater streams that come from the city and the industry, by harnessing the capability of cyanobacteria to grow in brackish water and to fix carbon dioxide through its metabolism. But this process has become slow and prone to errors, losing part of its output through photorespiration. From this understanding, we are focusing on enhancing the carbon fixing mechanisms of Synechococcus sp. and conducting the surplus of carbon flow to the synthesis of high added-value chemical intermediates, such as free fatty acids, to increase the economic feasibility of the implementation of Carbon Capture and Utilization technologies, which are urgently needed to fight back Climate Change. Systems Biology, Bioprocess Simulation, and integral stakeholder management have been performed to assess the feasibility and impact of the proposal here presented.
https://teams.igem.org/3107	Diagnostics	Like humans, animals experience stress but can't communicate even if they do. This can severely compromise animal welfare and animal rights. To address this issue, our goal is to make an eukaryotic bioluminescent system that detects stress in animals. To be more specific, if a targets level of cortisol rises to a certain level, our system will get triggered, causing its skin to light up. This will enable people to visibly check if animals are under stress, helping them to identify and eliminate possible causes of animal stress. To achieve this, we employed a newly discovered fungal bioluminescent system to design and construct a genetic circuit that detects cellular signals. Our project also includes mathematical modeling of the bioluminescent system to reach a desired outcome. Furthermore, we intend to apply our system to humans as well and hope to provide an effective stressmanaging system for people in the future.

We are going to characterize the trehalose synthase (TSase)  in the Bifidobacterium &#65292;which is widely used in the yogurt  and the Lactic acid bacteria drink. TSaes can convert maltose into the trehalose inside the Bifidobacterium ,  and the trehalose can protect the bifidobacterium by enhancing its resistance  to the freezing and dryness during the freeze dried process while fermentation. Furthermore, the inside trehalose can also extend the guarantee period and improve positive effects of the Probiotic drinks by enhancing the vitality of probiotcs.
https://teams.igem.org/3110	Therapeutics	The therapeutic landscape of oncology is fast changing. However, existing interventions are often limited by their cost, side-effects and efficiency. Our project aims to engineer a bacteria which can be used to treat colon cancer. Using Escherichia coli as our chassis, we will be expressing a colon cancer homing peptide on the bacteriums fimbriae which should aid it to attach specifically to colon cancer cells. As a fail-safe mechanism to reduce non-specific effects, we harness the abnormally high lactate levels in the tumour micro-environment as a second layer of confirmation to stimulate the bacteria to produce the immunomodulator Interleukin-12 (IL-12). We are making our bacteria lactate sensitive by tweaking the lactate metabolizing lldPRD operon.The secreted IL-12 inside the colon should trigger a signalling cascade which recruits immune effector cells to the tumour micro-environment - leading to tumour suppression.
https://teams.igem.org/3111	Therapeutics	Currently, the most commonly used cancer treatments are burdened by severe and undesirable side-effects. Several strategies have been employed to create targeted drug therapies which are able to effectively destroy cancerous cells while minimising effects on healthy ones. These include using antibodies and various types of polymer or lipid based nanoparticles. However, often such treatments are expensive, require substantial post-production modifications, or have stability issues. Encapsulins are highly stable, cheap, bacterially produced nano-compartments. We genetically fused HER2 targeting peptides to the encapsulins surface, and loaded them with photosensitisers, proteins which are able to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon illumination with a specific wavelength of light, to create a double selection targeted drug delivery vehicle. When introduced into the bloodstream, the encapsulins would travel to the tumor site, specifically bind to cancerous HER2 expressing cells, and will begin producing toxic ROS when illuminated - destroying only the cancerous cells.
https://teams.igem.org/3112	Foundational Advance	Since the Darwin era, the formation, accumulation and even retention of differences between species and species has not only been a core issue in evolutionary biology, but also one of the fundamental problems facing the entire life sciences. Cell fusion, as an effective way to exchange genetic material among distant species, is of great significance for the study of species evolution. The goal of iGEM Tianjin this year is to integrate a new chassis organism that contains a set of heterogeneous chromosome stabilization elements. To this end, we have combined Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Yarrowia lipolytic yeast to establish a key component of the chromosome by centromere, and at the same time created a new system based on sequential single-base editing technology to characterize the fusion results.
https://teams.igem.org/3113	Diagnostics	There is an increasing demand in biomedical research for techniques to monitor the dynamics of multiple genes over several time points. However, current methods such as gene reporters are limited to a few genes of interest or require sample destruction in the case of transcriptomic analysis. We thus engineered ALiVE as a diagnostics platform for the Analysis of Living cells via Vesicular Export. In particular, we adapted the mechanisms of exosome secretion and viral budding to export specific transcripts from living cells repeatedly over time. Based on versatile BioBricks, we generated bio-orthogonal RNA-adapters and modified membrane proteins with affinity tags to enable convenient purification of the exported RNA. We also introduced sensitive luciferase reporters to quantify vesicle secretion efficiency and collateral transfection. ALiVE is a generalizable technology for minimally invasive diagnostics of gene expression dynamics in cellular model systems and holds great promise for monitoring cellular therapies in regenerative medicine.
https://teams.igem.org/3114	Food & Nutrition	Excess chlorophyll in canola seeds, an issue known as green seed, requires expensive and harmful methods during oil processing. iGEM Calgary designed a protein-based emulsion system as an alternative to the current environmentally-detrimental method. A chlorophyll binding protein was emulsified and used to remove excess chlorophyll from green oil. Phase diagrams and molecular dynamic simulations were used to optimize our emulsion system, and genetic algorithms were used to engineer the chlorophyll binding protein to have improved binding capabilities and stability. Captured chlorophyll was repurposed into pheophorbide, a cytotoxic photosensitizer with antifungal properties. A novel universal spacer was developed via interaction and homology modelling, which enabled purification of the large plant enzymes required for the production of pheophorbide. This project addressed multiple challenges found within canola production and processing. Our solution has the potential to improve current practices and potentially introduce a new market stream for the canola industry.
https://teams.igem.org/3115	Therapeutics	Monoclonal antibody (MAb) therapies are a new frontier of pharmaceuticals used for treating a variety of illnesses such cancer. However, the administration of MAbs may be associated with an overactive immune response that cause extremely dangerous side effects. To help solve this problem we created an antibody kill switch in which a small molecule can quickly turn the antibody off in the body and mitigate these side effects. Using computer protein modeling, we engineered an antibody with two compartments, the first consists of the variable antibody domains while the second is our kill switch. This kill switch region is AraC, a bacterial transcription factor that forms a homodimer that dramatically changes its dimer orientation when bound to the small molecule arabinose. In our design, when arabinose binds the AraC compartment, it pulls apart the homodimer, rendering our antibody nonfunctional. This concept could create a new generation of safer monoclonal antibodies.
https://teams.igem.org/3116	Environment	As seen in Flint, Michigan, water supplies can be contaminated by aging infrastructure. Our team is based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin which also has a lead problem. Our team is developing a method to identify lead in water through our sense of smell. By putting the gene for an enzyme that produces the wintergreen scent under the control of a lead-inducible promoter and placing this construct in E. coli, we have created an engineered organism that will detect lead by providing a scent. By putting this engineered E. coli in a capsule which will dissolve in water, any individual can collect a water sample and use this test. The E. coli is safe and this kit is environmentally friendly due to the lack of any plastic parts. This will allow people to test any sample of water they suspect is contaminated by lead and seek an appropriate remedy.
https://teams.igem.org/3117	Foundational Advance	Whilst monoclonal antibodies were the first breakthrough in immunotherapy a few years ago, now bispecific antibodies are at the forefront of research. Our iGEM Team at FAU Erlangen chose to explore the parts and components of bispecific antibodies in a comprehensive manner. Our wet-lab team is testing three different designs inspired by the Bispecific T-cell Engager (BiTE), which differ in their linker. Bispecific antibodies, such as the BiTE are a promising approach to hurdles otherwise faced in current treatment methods, as BiTEs enable immune-cells to target colorectal cancer cells (Graber K. 2014). We envision a modular and simulation-aided (MD-simulations) approach to engineering such bispecific antibodies, thus allowing a higher adaptability to different treatments . We hope that one day the modularity of BiTEs will be a new standard and we want to make our contribution to creating these foundations.

https://teams.igem.org/3120	Foundational Advance	Cell landscape, a collection of biological bigdata of cell that integrates genome, transcriptome, proteome, metabolome and immune group, which is the basis for understanding the complex system of cells. However, existing techniques for acquiring cell landscapes have defects such as complicated operation, time consuming, and destruction of cells. Our goal is to accurately reflect the landscape of cells by detecting several simple indicators such as fluorescent phenotypes. After in-depth communication, the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process of embryonic stem cells is used as our research vector. Our experiments focused on giving cells specific and regulatable fluorescent phenotypes, controlling EMT processes, monitoring fluorescence changes and collecting RNA omics data.
https://teams.igem.org/3121	New Application	Low intrinsic stability has marred the production of psychrophilic proteins in commonly used mesophilic systems. This may lead to a lopsided bias towards the expression of the few psychrophilic proteins which can manage a stable structure at those temperatures. Of the two possible approaches to help counterpoise the expression in favor of most psychrophilic proteins, the approach we have taken is to develop a new psychrophilic host. Rather than characterizing novel strains, we plan on converting a highly characterized system in synthetic biology, E.coli, by introducing genes that confer cold-tolerance to it thereby reducing dependency on regular mesophilic hosts and possibly making it the model system for cold temperature-based systems.
https://teams.igem.org/3122	Diagnostics	Waterborne infectious diseases kill thousands in developing countries every year. This project develops an affordable and easy-to-use early-detection system for cholera suited for such countries. Our technological base is aptamers: single-stranded DNA molecules engineered to interact with specific disease proteins. We integrate them into two kind of sensors: lateral-flow-analysis for ultra-low-resource areas, and electrochemical sensors for electricity-enabled areas. Furthermore, with our automated aptamer-discovery protocol (Robo-SELEX), we enable future targeting of different diseases. For characterizing the resulting aptamers We have also developed a deep-learning computational folding and an automatic kinetic characterization protocol. Disease-prevention have always a socio-political dimension. We have also undertaken on-the-ground research in Cameroon, together with local people and scientists, to identify the actual needs that must be addressed and adapting the design of the final sensor to them. Our project is both interdisciplinary and intercultural, which takes us further than the simple sum of our parts.
https://teams.igem.org/3123	Foundational Advance	Although biosensors are commonly used to detect many different molecules of interest, they cannot effectively detect small hydrophobic molecules in biological systems. We propose combining chemically induced dimerization (CID), in which two proteins dimerize only in the presence of a ligand, with a traditional luciferase assay to create a biosensor that luminesces when the desired molecule is introduced. Using molecule-specific nanobodies, we can design the two CID binders to attach to a wide variety of small molecules, even those that are challenging for conventional biosensors to detect. Through its specificity and ability to bind to small or hydrophobic molecules, the CID system overcomes problems that other biosensors face. As a proof-of-concept, we implemented an in vivo CID biosensor to detect the presence of cannabidiol. With the nanobody CID system, we hope to introduce a novel biosensor that can detect a variety of important small molecules across research, biotechnology, and medicine.

https://teams.igem.org/3125	Village	Nitrogenous fertilizer is a vital component of food production, but unfortunately, it is both inefficient and bad for the environment. A potential alternative to chemical fertilizers is rhizobia, a microorganism that takes nitrogen from the air and converts it into nitrates. The nitrates can then be readily used by the host legume and surrounding organisms after the legume decays. Current challenges in the use of rhizobia in agriculture include desiccation, bacterial competition, and other osmotic stressors. Our project works to improve rhizobias agricultural capabilities through overexpression of a gene involved in trehalose biosynthesis, otsA. Expected benefits include increased nitrogenase activity, increased tolerance to environmental stressors, and increased crop yield of associated legumes. This next-generation of rhizobia will be a stepping stone to transforming agricultural practices to be both economically and ecologically sustainable.
https://teams.igem.org/3126	Environment	At present, heavy metal pollution is quite serious, which has great harm to the environment and organisms. HBUT-China iGEM team noted the serious problem and focused on the treatment of nickel, one of the major ions causing heavy metal pollution. The team chose Saccharomyces cerevisiae as chassis, build an engineering strain that can actively absorb nickel ions and store nickel ions in vacuoles. Nickel ions can be first captured onto the surface of yeasts by a surface display system, then will be transferred nickel ions to cells by a channel protein. At last they are successfully transferred to vacuoles by a translocator, which can strengthen yeasts tolerance to Nickel ions. In addition to the absorption, we also envisage recovering nickel ions, so that the original nickel waste can regain its value. We also made a working model of our processing system, combining with a cell immobilization technology.
https://teams.igem.org/3127	Foundational Advance	In nature, the microorganisms dont exist in isolation, but interact and cooperate to accomplish the complex tasks in the complicated ecosystem. In the microbiological industry like fermentation, the bacteria co-culture is promising. However, it is difficult for people to achieve dynamic regulation in the co-culture system. This year, we build a LCBC system (Light Controlled Bacteria Co-culture). In the system, we use the lights with different colors to regulate and control the amount and ratio of the bacteria. This system consists of three parts: two orthogonal light-controlled systems, the QS system which is designed for bi-directional communication, and the toxin/antitoxin system that can regulate the amount and ratio of the bacteria. We also develop the matching software to help the users apply our system. In the future, we envision our bacteria co-culture system being applied in the fermentation and other related microbial engineering.
https://teams.igem.org/3128	Diagnostics	What can your tears tell about you? Joy, sadness, pain What if they could tell so much more? Tears are often neglected as potential diagnostic fluids. However, in addition to their advantageous accessibility, they are unexpectedly rich and contain lots of biological materials. Due to the close spatial proximity of the lacrimal glands and the cranial nerves, an overview of tear composition captures also the pathophysiological changes in the central nervous system. Thus, even if research in tear fluid biomarkers is at an early stage, tear fluid sampling may become a non-invasive and non-painful technique to diagnose patients with neurodegenerative disorders. NeuroDrop aims to demonstrate that the detection of small amounts of biomarkers is possible in small volumes, like tears for example. This is achievable with an innovative synthetic biosensor, coupled with a smart hardware device, enabling sensitive detection in a few microliters.
https://teams.igem.org/3130	Village	Today, approximately 269,000 tons of plastic is floating in open ocean. Using E. coli transformed with plasmids expressing PETase, an enzyme from Ideonella sakaiensis that degrades polyethylene terephtalate (PET), this projects purpose was to develop a more thermostable and efficient enzyme to combat this microplastic pollution. Nine E. coli strains were engineered, each with unique mutations to alter the PETase activity and thermodynamic properties. Growth assays were conducted at different temperatures, with and without the presence of the PET substrate. Protein expression analysis of the mutants revealed a band for every strain at approximately 31 kDa, the expected size of PETase. Using a plate reader, absorption of the samples was measured and peaks at 260 nm were compared to detect the presence of MHET, a downstream product of PET degradation. With success, a faster and more efficient PETase enzyme could eventually be the solution to end the plastic pollution problem.

Moreover, presently it is hard to evaluate and trace the therapeutic role of Synthetic Immune Cells. Here, we designed and characterized a novel Engineered Theranostics with the core device in which the CAR-immune cells were reprogramed to co-evolve with tumor-antigens and to send secondary signals to trigger custom-designed external devices. Two kinds of external devices, a Peripheral Probe for tracing the activity of CAR-immune cells and an Antibody Pump for enhancing Immune cell killing efficacy were further developed. The whole system is named after Wukong (Monkey King) of the Journey to the West.
https://teams.igem.org/3133	High School	Alzheimers disease (AD) is a progressively neurodegenerative disease, with typical hallmarks of amyloid &#946; (A&#946;) plaque accumulation, neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) formation and neuronal death extension. There are only five FDA-approved drugs for the relief or treatment of AD, including tacrine, donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine, and memantine, despite their varied side effects in clinical use, which cannot substantially block the progress of the disease. Therefore, it is important to develop effective new anti-AD drugs. Autophagy is a physiological process for cells to remove macromolecules, cell subunits and aggregates that affect normal cell functions. It has been believed to be a promising target for anti-AD drug discovery. Here, we use mWasabi-tagRFP fluorescence-tagged LC3 (mWasabi-tagRFP-LC3) to monitor the autophagic flux in SH-SY5Y cells. We find a compound effectively increased both yellow and red puncta in SH-SY5Y cells compared with the control cells, indicating that it may stimulate autophagic flux.
https://teams.igem.org/3134	High School	In China, with the popularity of electronic devices, we spend more time in front of electronic display screens. However, the blue light emitted by the display screen is extremely harmful to our health. Here, we develop a type of micro-organism that can record the length of time it is exposed to blue light. We find that Cas1-Cas2 complex which proteins in the process of cutting and inserting DNA fragments into CRISPR array, can be restrained by Thermobifida fusca (Tfus) Cas3. We construct plasmids with Cas1-Cas2 and Cas3 expression, and the Cas3 is built downstream of FixK2 promoter controlled by blue light sensor. Therefore, a quantitative relationship between the acquisition of new spacers of the CRISPR array in Cas1-Cas2 and the length of time that the bacteria are exposed in blue light is developed. Combining this technique with practical applications will yield a method to measure time of blue light emitting.

How to ensure temperature never rised during the storage and transport in a precise and convenience way is critical. RNA thermometers, which are RNA-based sensors, control the gene expression by achieving certain temperature. Here, we construct a library of RNA thermometers, based on thermodynamic computations, to express chromoproteins or fluorescent proteins in cell-free system. Our results show that the RNA thermometer system reacts with visible colors by the temperature rises in a short time. Our results also demonstrate that this system has high capability of detecting temperatures in small amounts of changing. We design and try to make a commercial, cheap and simple product to put on vaccine package. We anticipate our assay is a starting point of detecting temperature and could be applied to other fields, for example, food.
https://teams.igem.org/3136	Village	African Swine Fever virus, ASFv, is a double-stranded DNA virus fatal to pigs. ASFv reached China in 2018 and epidemic was reported on August 2nd. When infected by ASFv, symptoms such as diarrhea are identified on pigs; to prevent dissemination, effective detection is momentous as the infected population must be quarantined. However, the current method in China is inefficient while the virus could spread and cause immeasurable economic loss in pork-consuming countries. Shanghai HS United iGEM team shows an innovative method to detect ASFv among the pigs by test strips with FITC probes to determine the results positivity. Our results demonstrate loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and Cas12a reaction together shorten the detection and satisfies our three aims  simplicity, immediacy, and accuracy. We believe our method is practical and operational by the pig owners and is cheaper and more effective than PCR, so treatments can be instantly implemented.
https://teams.igem.org/3137	Village	Escherichia coli is one of the most commonly used bacteria in biological laboratories and microbial fermentation industry. However, in practical application, phage infection is often encountered, which affects the process of biological experiments and causes huge economic losses. Therefore, we aim to construct a phage-resistant strain of Escherichia coli by combining two biological component circuits. In Escherichia coli BL21, we achieve absolute resistance to specific phages through phage inducible promoter PA and PB, as well as resistant protein components antP and toxic protein components kilP. At the same time, we used fluorescent protein genes gfp and mCherry to alarm phage infection at different periods and monitor the status of phage infection strains in real-time. With our genetic circuitry, E. coli has a longer-term application in laboratory experiments and fermentation production, and can produce stably without interference from phage in the fermentation production of &#947;-aminobutyric acid, &#946;-aminobutyric acid, 2,5-dimethylpyrazine, etc.
https://teams.igem.org/3138	Environment	The aim of the project was to develop biofilters based on eco-friendy polymers, designed for purifying air from heavy metals. Microorganism used in the research was Yarrowia lipolytica, a popular non-conventional yeast used in bioremediation, due to its ability to absorb high concentrations of heavy metals. The goal was to create a strain expressing genes responsible for the synthesis of lycopene and &#947;-decalactone. The genes will be placed under the control of metal induced promoters and cloned into the yeast to generate red color and peachy smell, once the concentration of heavy metals reaches high level. Out of six analyzed genes, two were expressed when cells were exposed to heavy metals. The promoters of these genes were identified and characterized, followed by their application in the pathway of lycopene and &#947;-decalactone production. Currently, application of Y. lipolytica cells with inducible lycopene biosynthesis pathway trapped in eco-friendy polymers are under investigation.

It is widely known that mosquito plays host to malaria. Traditionally, people control malaria by killing mosquitoes using drugs. However, this may give birth to drug-resistant mosquitoes. In the meanwhile, killing may jeopardize the stability of the niche of mosquitoes. Our project hopes to find a new way entitled MARS in synthetic biology to control malaria. We engineer the symbiotic bacteria Serratia sp., which stably colonize in the mosquitos midgut, to produce various anti-plasmodium peptides and kill the plasmodium in their most vulnerable stage. We apply the polyprotein strategy in our project, and build gene passways to produce fusion effector protein and TEVp secreted by the alpha-hemolysin secretion system with different promotor combinations to acquire an ideal expression ratio with the aid from our modeling.
https://teams.igem.org/3140	Village	One in four people will experience an episode of mental illness at some point in their life, and the required support services make up a significant portion of healthcare expenditure worldwide. Psilocybin, found naturally in 'magic mushrooms' (<i>Psilocybe</i> spp.), has shown great promise in clinical trials for the treatment of mental illnesses including treatment resistant depression and end of life anxiety. At present, psilocybin is produced via an expensive chemical synthesis process, which limits its availability for research. This project aims to clone the psilocybin biosynthesis pathway genes (<i>psiH, psiD, psiK, psiM</i>) into <i>Escherichia coli</i>, to provide a cheaper and more reliable source of this compound. Previous work has shown that the fungal enzymes PsiD, PsiK, and PsiM are functional when expressed in bacteria, but PsiH is thus far untested. We will use codon harmonisation and N-terminal modification methods to optimise PsiH expression, in order to complete the biosynthetic pathway.

Our project MINILOSS (MIcrofluidic orgaN chIp for bLOod glucoSe Stabilization) commits to an innovative, painless, bio-based approach for diabetic treatment. Ordinary people have functional pancreas to secrete insulin to metabolize glucose, while diabetics need insulin injection. Our ultimate goal is to enable probiotic bacteria within the GI tract to sense glucose level and to secrete insulin by the synthetic bacteria. Currently, we have accomplished an in vitro model to illustrate such a process.

Our project is designed to solve both the detection and the remediation of heavy metal pollution in one system. Implementing the MerR and PbrR sensor proteins, as well as an amplifying module downstream involving TEV and CI434, the detection system can reliably output a zero-or-one signal on the presence of mercury and lead through GFP. We have also incorporated the curli and spytag-spycatcher mechanism in our remediation module. Such mechanism creates an interconnected biofilm of spycatcher sockets, on which metal-binding proteins can be attached to the surface of our engineered bacteria. We have applied this to maximize the surface area of reaction, which magnifies the remediation efficiency. Combined with our purification hardware, our product offers an affordable yet smart solution for heavy metal pollution.

Biological desalination might be a better method that grants no harm to the environment. Reducing the concentration of salts (especially NaCl) in the water is the main objective. CU team is working on two approaches: Accumulating the salt inside the microbial cell by improving the sequestration of sodium and chloride ions and modifying the cells not to release the salts, and overcome the toxic effect of salts on the cell by expressing osmoprotectant and by increasing vacuoles uptake of the salts. The second approach is to synthesize Cell-free Na and Cl binding proteins to avoid the drawbacks of introducing modified microorganisms into the water. The system is meant to be integrated as a pre-treatment step in the current desalination infrastructure.

During maintenance of aircraft, hexavalent chromium can be released causing severe environmental and health impacts. With increasing regulations, there is a critical need for a cheap, quick and effective detection test. Through our human practices, potential users were reticent about using engineered live microbes and since hexavalent chromium is toxic to bacteria, we set out to develop a cell-free system which includes the repressor, ChrB, that binds to the chromium promoter ChrP. In the presence of hexavalent chromium, ChrB is released from ChrP, allowing for the expression of a reporter gene. We explore the use of two different reporter genes: a green fluorescent protein, and a bacterial flavin-containing monooxygenase, an enzyme that results in visible indigo production. Therefore, in the presence of hexavalent chromium, the system will produce a visible color change.

Even today, highly polluting forms of energy such as oil, coal and gas provide for about 80% of our energy needs. In order to reduce our dependence on these unsustainable forms of energy, our project focused on improving the efficiency of microbial fuel cells (MFCs) - battery-like devices that utilise energy from exo-electrogenic bacteria. We did this by making contributions to the research of the Mtr pathway of the exo-electrogenic bacterium Shewanella oneidensis, while attempting to improve its performance by variably expressing the pathway components inside the bacterium and adjusting its functioning in aerobic environments. We also did modeling and laboratory research in collaborations on further applications of MFCs involving the breakdown of the highly prominent plastic polymer, PET.

However, this type of tool is not available when it comes to proteins. The first aim of the KARMA project was to create a new tool for specific protein degradation. In order to accomplish that, we thought about using a non-specific protease, to which we add a VHH that will act as a research head to make it more specific, and targeting a protein in a complex environment. We chose to perform a complete proof of concept using well-known systems, the TEV protease and a VHH against sfGFP, to characterize in detail whether this type of tool could be effective. We then considered the possible applications of this tool, particularly to counter the antibiotic resistance caused by outer antibiotic degrading-enzymes like beta-lactamases.
https://teams.igem.org/3148	High School	Mussel Foot proteins, a strong adhesive, water insoluble and flexible protein which is nontoxic and do not impose immunogenicity to the human body, can be used as medical adhesives. Our project focuses on building adhesives with a celebrated protein: mussel foot protein, and make it into a Band-Aid that can seal the wound quickly. In order to achieve those aim, two properties, adhesion and cohesion, become crucial. The MFP is proven by many scientists to have a strong adhesive power. But for achieving cohesive, we elaborate the MFP by fusing natural spider silk protein Masp1 into it. The Masp1 protein, flexible but also adhesive, with its cohesion and strength, will further assist our product in wound sealing. By fusing them, we get the MFP-Masp1 protein and by bio-manufacturing this protein using E. coli. We consider that this could ultimately develop into a new material in daily medications.
https://teams.igem.org/3149	Village	Owing to the increasing prevalence of diabetes, novel approaches for continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) that can be readily implemented without the need for trained personnel or specialized equipment are highly ideal. Bacterial whole-cell biosensors (WCBs) capable of continuous monitoring of diabetes-related parameters could be used to engineer devices that can help diabetic patients achieve and maintain normal blood glucose levels. We hypothesize that genetically engineered bacteria encapsulated within a polymeric matrix (a bio-ink) can be used to biofabricate wearable/implantable WCBs for CGM such as epidermal bio-tattoos, microneedles, and implantable scaffolds. Furthermore, the ability of WCBs to transduce biological recognition into a colorimetric signal will allow the design of devices that do not require expensive analytical equipment or trained personnel to be applied and interpreted. This approach provides several advantages over conventional electrochemical biosensors such as the potential for multiparametric measurements, autonomy, simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and ease of administration/interpretation.

However, the producing wastewater containing Azo dyes has become one of the major sources of pollution, which is not only destructive to local ecosystem but also toxic and harmful to human health. In this project, we aim to construct engineered E. coli-based system to treat wastewater containing Azo dyes. Two azoreductases (Azr, AzoR) and two laccases (CotA and ScLac) were transformed into E. coli for decolorization and detoxification of azo dyes specifically. Our results show that the laccases have very good performance in decolorization of Reactive Red. Thus, the laccase might be a promising candidate for the biological treatment of industrial dye wastewaters. We hope that through our efforts, we can provide a convenient, practical, clean and economical method to degrade azo dyes and improve the water quality environment of our hometown.
https://teams.igem.org/3151	Village	Australia is positioned to become a world leader in hydrogen production and export by 2030. Hydrogen gas detection is notoriously challenging, being odourless, colourless and explosive at low concentrations (4%). From the canary in the coal mine, to the advanced gas detection equipment available today, the reliable detection of dangerous gas leaks remains of paramount importance. Hydrogen gas detectors are prone to cross-sensitivity due to the presence of other gases interfering with the measurement. Team HyDRA designed a highly specific hydrogen gas biosensor using Escherichia coli, containing a NiFe hydrogenase, cyclic-di-GMP riboswitch and cyclic-di-GMP phosphodiesterase. We designed this system to produce a fluorescent signal upon the detection of sufficient hydrogen gas to be considered a safety threat (40,000 ppm). Consultations with fire rescue, gas production and pipeline industries have guided us to design a prototype, resulting in a safe, reliable and efficient alternative method for quantifying hydrogen gas.

During this season, our team has designed a novel system to detect and degrade &#946;-lactams in order to provide a potential solution to antibiotic pollution. Mec system from Staphylococcus aureus and the &#946;-lactamase blaCMY-10 in Enterobacter aerogenes were designed as our antibiotics detective and degradative system respectively, which were adapted into E. coli. The results of antibiotics detection illustrated that it can be sensitive to low concentration of ampcilin. And the zone of inhibition test showed that blaCMY10 can effectively degrade ampcilin, cephalothin and cefoxitin which is consistent with what we expected. In our final applied design, we aim to create a combined device, it can be installed at wastewater treatment facilities and the drainage outlet at hospitals, farms and so on.

In this project, we intend to develop genetically engineered bacteria for As treatment based on bioremediation by using synthetic biology approaches.We aim to build engineered bacteria which consists of mainly two parts: arsenic-responsive reporter system and a bioabsorbent system with two different types. One is a surface-displayed system for the overexpression of an arsenic-chelating metallothionein (fMT), and the other is a phytochelatin synthase (PCS) which can produce phytochelatin for the removal of arsenic in the cell.For the future, we expect we can establish a promising and economical method to solve the problem of As pollution.
https://teams.igem.org/3154	Village	Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among Indian women with 500 million people at risk, and an unforgiving 50% mortality rate. Poor awareness and access to effective screening have caused enormous disease burden. We are developing a biosensor comprising nucleic-acid toehold switches designed to bind to certain identified differentially expressed circulating miRNA biomarkers of early-stage cervical cancer, namely miRNA-20a, miRNA-21, miRNA-29a and miRNA-200a. Each toehold switch is a second-generation design, requiring a biomarker-antimiR complex to release the expression of GFP, whose fluorescence intensity is measured. We are modelling and calibrating the performance of our toehold switches, and offering a web-server for the integrated design of these switches that uses multi-layer neural networks. Our parts characterization is performed cell-free. The developed switches may be embedded in a composite biosensor to yield a paper-based device for detecting cervical cancer.
https://teams.igem.org/3155	Village	The rise of electric vehicles has created a large demand for batteries. And, with the recent push to declare a climate emergency, it seems that this problem will not be solved by building greater quantities of environment-damaging rare metal batteries (eg. lithium-ion). This iGEM project attempts to solve this issue by building an enzymatic fuel cell to use the abundant, industrial by-product, glycerol to efficiently create clean energy. A three enzyme pathway and the mild radical oxidant TEMPO-NH2 are used to carry out the complete oxidation of glycerol. The three enzymes were manufactured via E. Coli and 6-His tag purification. Finally, the kinetics data is reported with either spectro-photometric measurements of NADH or quantitative H-NMR.
https://teams.igem.org/3156	High School	DNA is a biological macro-molecule which can carry huge amount of information accurately, and this feature can be used to achieve data recordings in vivo. Our project aims to build a biological recorder that can monitor extracellular information and record it on DNA. Recombinase or CRISPR base-editor is used to target specific DNA addresses and generate mutations in a reporter gene, so the recordings can be quantitatively measured to infer intensity and duration information about the chemicals of disease, such as inflammatory bowel disease. Additionally, we designed a hardware for in situ biomolecular detection to monitor gastrointestinal health. This platform could enable more precise detection and could help improve the management and diagnosis of gastrointestinal disease.
https://teams.igem.org/3157	High School	Thailand is an agriculture-based country. However, Thai farmers face economic hardships. The aim is to reduce the input cost by developing transgenic bacteria that will help plants fix nitrogen without the application of chemical fertilizers. We aim to synthesize Agrobacterium that is able to infect plants with inserted Nif genes from Azospirillum brasilense. By using Agrobacteriums ability to infect and transfer its DNA, we hope to allow plants to independently fix nitrogen. Nif genes were extracted from Azospirillum brasilense, transferred into E.coli as part of 2 vectors, pGem and pCambia, and put into Agrobacterium. Our design allows for the creation of a product such as biofertilizers or a gel-like-substance mixed with Agrobacterium which should increase the yield of crops. Although we were not able to transform our trangenic Agrobacterium into a product due to time constraints and other limitations we still hope that others will continue this in the future.
https://teams.igem.org/3158	High School	M-Phenylenediamine (MPD) is an important raw material of organic synthesis, but it is also a common chemical pollutant which causes toxicity to aquatic animals and humans. Until now, people do not have a cost effective and convenient way to degrade MPD. Here we use three starting microbial strains with adaptive evolution to degrade MPD. The first two strans are Escherichia coli MG1655 and the strain with laccase expression plasmid which is reported degrading polyphenols, and the other is an unknown strain isolated from contaminated sludge. Under the increasing supplement of MPD in their culture media, the adaptive evolution may happen during generations. Our results demonstrate the lasccase overexpression E. coli strans has the ability to degrade MPD. We also inditified the unknown strain is Bacillus aryabhattai B8W22, and it is able to degrade the analogues of MPD. And the adaptive evolution to decompose MPD may achieve in the future study.
https://teams.igem.org/3159	High School	All women are at risk of cervical cancer which has become a leading cause of womens death. Although precancerous treatment can markedly lower mortality rates, they are still high worldwide due to limited access to cervical cancer screening. Here we demonstrate specific protein expression variations related to NFX1 over-expression, a gene found to be closely associated with cervical cancer. Hela cells were either injected with empty vectors, or plasmids containing NFX1 and GFP genes. After they fully expressed inserted genes, we ran Western Blot, IP MS, and FASP to determine and confirm the differential proteins. After careful analysis, the statistical outcomes of IP and FASP Mass Spectrum combined, indicated significant changes in the expression of 280 proteins caused by NFX1 overexpression. Our findings can serve as a convenient biomarker to identify people carrying over-expressed NFX1, signal high risk of cervical cancer, and prevent cervical cancer in early stages.
https://teams.igem.org/3160	WIKI	Gastric cancer (GC), a malignant epithelial cancer disease, is associated with a high global incidence of mortality. There are only limited diagnostic methods for early detection of GC. Thus, there is an urgent search for new, non-invasive, biomarkers to allow early detection of GC. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small (~22 bp) nucleic acids that function by regulating the expression of target genes. Previous studies indicated miRNAs can serve as a potential source for biomarkers for detection of human malignancies, including GC. We chose four miRNAs (miR-17, miR-21, miR-196a and miR-148a) expressed in patients serum of different stages of GC and established four miRNA sensors to detect these miRNAs in GC cells. Our results suggested the sensor of miR-196a and miR-148a is a better monitor to detect miRNA expression in GC cells than others. Our project may provide a new non-invasive method to diagnosis gastric cancer in early stage in the future.
https://teams.igem.org/3161	WIKI	Lead contamination is one of the most severe heavy metal pollutions in the world, due to its widespread use and incorrect disposal to environment. Accumulation of lead can cause lead poisoning to all living organisms. In this project, we aim to design and construct a E.coli-based system to sense and bioabsorb the lead to provide a promising way for lead pollution treatment. We tried to construct the lead bioremediation system combined with a lead-responsive reporter system. The lead bioremediation system includes two metal-binding proteins, a metallothionein and a synthetic phytochelatin expressed by surface-display system. For the future, we hope through our effort, we can finally establish a reliable, low cost method to solve the problem of lead pollution in serious contamination areas.
https://teams.igem.org/3163	Manufacturing	Camptothecin is a topoisomerase inhibitor and a potent anti-cancer drug used to treat colon cancer, ovarian cancer, and small cell lung cancer amongst others. Indias primary source of camptothecin is Nothapodytes nimmoniana, a plant endemic to the Western Ghats. N. nimmoniana is now endangered due to overharvesting for medicinal purposes. The fungal endophyte fungal endophyte Fusarium solani can be synthetically modified to produce camptothecin as the camptothecin biosynthesis pathway has been elucidated and F. solani has most components of the pathway except for one - the enzyme strictosidine synthase (STR). This approach of engineering the fungal endophyte with the enzyme STR will reduce the harm caused to native biodiversity.
https://teams.igem.org/3165	New Application	Co-culture has numerous applications in biology for studying natural or synthetic interactions between cell populations. In artificial or laboratory settings it is difficult to ensure the co-culture of species due to variety of factors : growth rate being the primary reason which results in one species out-competing the another. Our project aims to dynamically control the co-culture of E.coli and B. subtilis by using optogenetics. Optogenetics provides precise spatio-temporal resolution which overcomes the limitations of existing co-culture techniques(i.e. : Quorum Sensing, Auxotrophic cross-feeding etc.) .The hardware component of our project measures the ratio of population at regular intervals and utilizes lasers to regulate the growth of the species.
https://teams.igem.org/3166	Village	Squalene, a universal precursor of various bioactive compounds, has unique physical and chemical properties, making it beneficial to human. Sharks' liver oil is the richest natural origin of squalene. However, this origin is limited because of epidemic marine pollution, overfishing of sharks and the international concern on shark protection. The goal of this research is to produce squalene using E.coli, the most common microbial factory. To achieve this, we need to introduce exogenous squalene synthase (SQS) into E.coli. Firstly, we compared the yield using SQSs from different species. To facilitate this, CrtN, turning colorless squalene into yellow ß-carotene, is introduced. Secondly, an exogenous MVA pathway is introduced and a more effective MEP pathway is developed via overexpression of key regulatory enzymes. Both pathways produce the precursor of squalene in E.coli and eventually improve the squalene yield. This research provides an alternative to squalene production, bringing positive effects on shark protection.
https://teams.igem.org/3168	Diagnostics	The discovery of new antibiotics lags behind the continuing increase in antimicrobial resistance (AMR), a process heavily accelerated by the misuse of antibiotics. Antibiotics are misused in a preventive manner (mainly cattle), misused to treat non-bacterial-related ailments and misused by unspecific treatment of bacterial infections. With our fast and specific diagnostic method for bacterial infections, this will become a problem of the past. Our modular method uses the specificity and amplification speed of bacteriophages in combination with the specificity and sensitivity of the dCas9-NanoLuc-complex to revolutionize the diagnosis of bacterial infections. Our method enables the diagnosis of infections within an hour, making fast and specific use of antibiotics possible. Moreover, the application of this method is broad; from fast specific diagnosis of infections, both in human as well as in veterinary medicine, to going beyond the diagnosis of infections by detecting bacteria in drinking water or in the food industry.
https://teams.igem.org/3169	Open	The initiatives by the iGEM-UPRM team achieved a broader understanding of Synthetic Biology in Puerto Rico. Team efforts facilitated the introduction of the Synthetic Biology course and laboratory to our campus, being the first in the Caribbean. Pioneering and expanding the knowledge of this discipline, the team interacted with the community spreading awareness on the impact of Synthetic Biology via hands-on workshops. Continuing our journey, high school students across the Island participated in the first Synthetic Biology Summer Camp; where they constructed and presented original prototypes using SBOL and BioBricks. Currently, the team plans general public engagement in the first Synthetic Biology Week on campus through panels and round table discussions. The teams ongoing prototype, Coli.CTRL, would be a redesigned bacteria capable of responding to stimuli and express a user-defined genetic construct. iGEM-UPRM aspires to continue impacting the social, educational, and investigative sectors of Puerto Rico within Synthetic Biology.
https://teams.igem.org/3170	Therapeutics	Adenocarcinoma is a malignant tumor that is difficult to diagnose and treat. We designed a system which can generate different responses by judging the current state of cells to improve the efficiency of diagnosis. We used a regulatory line of protein-protein interactions to achieve this aim. We extracted TIL cells from the patient's cancer cells and then injected the engineered TIL cells back. TIL cells can target cancer cells, while exosomes automatically encapsulate mRNA and send it to cancer cells. If the cells are normal, the system wont start; if only a few cells are cancerous, the system will increase the amount of ALKBH5 through the ras-raf pathway receptor to attenuate the expression of the wnt pathway; if a large number of cells have undergone cancer, the system will initiate an apoptosis program through the hypoxia-inducible factor system, releasing a large amount of casp3 to promote apoptosis of cancer cells.
https://teams.igem.org/3171	New Application	Communication of sensitive data is becoming less safe. Common methods such as email often do not provide sufficient protection to prevent interception. By combining our expertise from engineering, computer science, and synthetic biology, we created QRoningen, a protocol based on a physical QR code with the purpose of secure information sharing. Our homemade bioprinter can print reproducible QR code shapes using an alginate bioink that is infused with a mix of different bacterial strains. In order to protect your data, we have engineered E. coli and the fast-growing organism V. natriegens. Tools from synthetic biology such as inducible promoters and kill switches are employed to reveal the QR code upon incubation in the proper environment. Only knowledge of the correct key, being the conditions of growth, will allow you to scan the QR code and receive the message, while exposure to the wrong cues will render it unreadable.
https://teams.igem.org/3172	Environment	Citrus greening is an infectious disease of citrus trees caused by Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus. The bacteria is found in the phloem of infected trees. The Asian citrus psyllid, a small insect, carries the bacteria in its salivary glands from infected trees to other trees. Citrus Greening causes premature fruit drop and shortens the lifespan of trees which has lowered the production of citrus fruits in Florida by 30 to 80% in the last 20 years. Our solution to Citrus Greening is to inject infected trees with a combination of three antimicrobial peptides. We designed genetic devices that can express antimicrobial peptides in New England Biolabs' PURExpress in vitro protein synthesis kit. We combined the synthesized peptides and demonstrated the inhibition of growth of E. coli and L. crescens which are model organisms for the target species. FLOEMA is a rapid prototyping platform in the epic race to save Floridas citrus.
https://teams.igem.org/3173	Foundational Advance	Peptide detection plays a pivotal role in various synthetic biology applications ranging from point-of-care diagnostics to personalized medicine, and real-time profiling of biological systems and the environment. Naturally occurring systems for peptide detection commonly employ G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), linking extracellular cues to intracellular responses. For our project, we will harness the power of directed evolution coupled to the specificity of GPCRs, establishing a versatile platform for directed evolution of S. cerevisiae mating receptor STE2. We employ both in vivo and in silico, machine-learning-guided evolution for exploring the landscape of cognate receptor-ligand pairs. We provide a cell-level probabilistic model faithfully describing our systems dynamics. Furthermore, we extend the signalling repertoire of S. cerevisiae by engineering fully orthogonal GPCRs and signalling cascades. We combine these features to engineer a comprehensive yeast receptor and signalling evolution toolbox, which we provide to the iGEM community.
https://teams.igem.org/3174	Foundational Advance	When a construct is added to a cell, resources are allocated towards expression of the construct. This creates additional cellular burden, making engineered bacterial populations less fit than the wild type. Over time, cells accumulate loss-of-function mutations within the construct, freeing cellular resources. These mutations increase cell fitness, prompting the mutation to sweep through the population. Therefore, the population cannot maintain the burden associated with the construct for a sustained number of generations. Our goal is to measure the growth rates of genetically modified cells to identify burdensome parts. We used the Ellis Labs burden monitor for E. coli to measure the burden of BioBricks from the iGEM Registry (Ceroni 2015). We transformed 500+ BioBricks into burden monitor DH10B E. coli and assayed growth rate versus GFP expression rate. We identified burdensome parts by analyzing measurements with a pipeline of scripts, determining growth rate reduction percentages against GFP expression rates.
https://teams.igem.org/3175	Village	With the advent of climate change, there are growing concerns over harmful algal blooms (HABs) and their impact on vital food sources, especially shellfish. Numerous rural and Indigenous communities depend on shellfish in their everyday diet and have deep cultural connections with it. Saxitoxin, a potent neurotoxin produced during HABs, accumulates in shellfish and has caused fatalities in Canada, leading to strict harvesting regulations. Despite this, current detection techniques are time-consuming and rely on expensive laboratory equipment. To overcome this, UBC iGEM is seeking to discover a novel saxitoxin-induced promoter for the construction of a biosensor. Our approach includes Substrate-Induced Gene Expression (SIGEX) and screening of a pre-existing E. coli promoter library. The project serves as a gateway for the development of accessible, on-site detection of shellfish toxins. This device can empower coastal communities, and encourage data collection for enhanced understanding of the impact that HABs have on our lives.
https://teams.igem.org/3176	Diagnostics	Rapid and precise diagnosis is critical to patient outcomes. Our goal is to develop a point-of-care diagnosis device, DIANE (Diagnosis is Now Easier), to be used for the detection of pathogens in biological fluids. The detection will take only a few minutes with a higher sensitivity than current serological cultures. Our device has been conceived to incorporate key design features based on feedback from physicians and scientists. It will be composed of aptamers linked to carbon nanotube electrodes, which will detect bacteria through a voltage change after binding. Aptamers are selectively identified from a library with the Whole-Cell SELEX method and chosen to recognize specific bacteria. Moreover, user-friendliness will be improved by automation with pumps and microfluidics. DIANE will enhance the diagnosis speed allowing doctors to adapt the treatment for each patient. We hope to make the diagnosis of critical life threatening situations quick and easy for practicians and NGOs.

https://teams.igem.org/3179	Therapeutics	Cancer is a threat for human welfare and finding effective drugs for a specific cancer is even thornier. As miRNA is widely used for tumor classification and prognosis, we now put forward an engineered adenovirus which can conditionally kill tumor cells by targeting unique miRNA profiles in specific cell. We assume to verify this system in colon cancer, so we developed a R package screening for specific recognition and found out miR-663b, miR-885-5p and miR-592 in COAD . Then we constructed corresponding miRNA sensors and used adenovirus early gene E1A and E1B55K to determine viral replication and tumor lysis. For safety concerns, Tet-on system is applied as a switch, and suppository or enemata may be our way of drug delivery. Math model is used to anticipate that this virus can be developed into a standardized instructive protocol for various cancer types as well as an efficient admission for cancer therapy.

By making scientific equipment more affordable and smaller, we believe we can make it more widely accessible, and enable more people to get that experience. OPENLUX is an affordable, Do-It-Yourself, open source microplate reader that aims to not only decrease the purchase price by at least 10-fold, but also to empower the user by being customisable. This allows for a mix & match of features, as well as self-service.
https://teams.igem.org/3182	Therapeutics	Burn wounds are being treated with high doses of antibiotics which are used systemically and does not treat the affected area. The mortality rate of burn victims after surviving the primary trauma is mainly caused by infections and bacteria prone to antibiotic resistance. The purpose of this project is to produce an antimicrobial bandage of a cheap and environmentally friendly material which in this case is cellulose but can be applied to other materials as well, such as chitosan and alginate. Antibacterial peptides and lysins are attached to this bandage via a carbohydrate binding domain. The agents are released upon exposure to thrombin which is present in the patients own blood. Therefore, the bandage could be an alternative to antibiotics or to an extent decrease the amount needed. The antibacterial spectrum of the bandage can either be broad through the use of antimicrobial peptides, or narrow by utilizing bacteriophage lysins.
https://teams.igem.org/3183	Therapeutics	Clostridioides difficile is the single most significant cause of hospital-acquired infections in the US with 500,000 infections per year, characterized by inflammation, diarrhea, bowel perforation and potential death. The predominant treatment for C. difficile infection is antibiotic prescription which disrupts the gut microbiome and exacerbates resistance concerns. Our solution is to engineer a Lactobacillus reuteri probiotic chassis to detect the quorum signaling autoinducing peptide of C. difficile in the intestinal lumen. Detection uses the C. difficile two component signaling system, to induce secretion of a C. difficile-specific endolysin to cleave its cell wall and leave the remaining intestinal flora intact. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to analyze the population dynamics of both species and refine our system within the spatial constraints of the human gut topology. Our design offers a targeted therapeutic for C. difficile infection, opening the possibility of a new modular system to treat gastrointestinal bacterial infection.

https://teams.igem.org/3185	Environment	Microplastics are tiny pieces of plastic accumulating in the environment, and harmful to ecosystems. They are produced in many ways, including washing-clothes processes. Microfibers from clothes are released into wastewater and eventually flows into the ocean without being processed. Our project aims to capture microfibers from household washing machines. To achieve this, we used encapsulins - protein-made spherical nanostructures - which can be engineered to display other proteins on their surface. We designed encapsulins which display proteins binds to plastic and microorganisms found in wastewater treatment plants. We picked up some proteins as plastic-binding proteins, and compared them with each other. In our strategy, microfibers may then be bound to microorganisms through engineered encapsulins and settled in sedimentation basins. This therefore avoids the introduction of GMOs into wastewater treatment processes. Combined with plastic-digesting enzymes, we believe our approach represents an effective way to deal with a common source of microplastics.
https://teams.igem.org/3187	Foundational Advance	Our goal is the development of a standardized, modular system based on biological nanoparticles to accelerate the research and development of novel vaccines, targeted drug delivery and other promising applications. The toolkit is based on virus-like particles (VLPs) which offer a multitude of desirable properties. VLPs are protein shells of viruses which are no longer infectious due to the lack of nucleic acids. For our purposes we use the bacteriophage P22 whose capsid can be produced via heterologous expression in variable hosts. The complex protein shell consists of two important compounds: the scaffold-protein (SP) and the coat-protein (CP). The CP is modified with an extension-tag. Therefore, an enzyme called sortase can connect any protein of interest which contains a corresponding tag. With the sortase modification the VLP functionality can be adapted to ones liking in no time, leading to a reduction in production and development costs for VLP-based technologies.

https://teams.igem.org/3189	Diagnostics	Contemporary use of antibiotics in medicine and agriculture has resulted in the sharp increase of drug-resistant bacteria. These resistant bacteria pose risks to human and livestock health, as commonly-used antibiotics become less effective for treating infections. Additionally, if animal products contaminated with antibiotics are consumed by humans, there is a risk that the consumers intestinal microbiota will be damaged or create their own resistant bacteria. In light of this, antibiotic detection and monitoring in the environment and in animal products are of very current relevance. In our project, weve used synthetic biology to develop a bacterial system that can sense tetracycline and respond to its presence by producing a non-toxic biological pigment. The resulting system produces a visible colour change after induction with water, dairy, or meat samples that contain tetracycline. This project lays the groundwork for the development of affordable and sustainable biosensors that can detect other antibiotics.
https://teams.igem.org/3190	Diagnostics	More than 90 million people worldwide are affected by infertility issues. To combat these issues, we present an innovative femtech medical device: Ovulaid - rethinking fertility tracking. Ovulaid is a yeast biosensor in a chewing gum. Our GPCR-based biosensor utilizes the refactored pheromone pathway to measure sex hormones - estradiol and LH - in saliva, producing visible color. This allows women to track their menstrual cycle and determine their fertile window. For easy monitoring we have created an app to interpret color in a photo of the gum. We have consulted multiple experts, involved our target group internationally and integrated concerns regarding safety, yeast viability, and taste into our product. We have confronted the legal and entrepreneurial difficulties our product could face, with great help from the iGEM community. With Ovulaid we hope to spread infertility awareness and help to solve the issues of infertility for women and couples worldwide.
https://teams.igem.org/3191	Therapeutics	Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a multidrug-resistant bacteria, making it difficult to treat. Almost 120,000 infections of MRSA occurred in 2017, with about 20,000 deaths. Current treatment often uses atypical antibiotics with uncertain effectiveness. Overuse of antibiotics has led to the problem of antibiotic resistance, which begs the advent of a different therapeutic approach. Incorporating Escherichia coli into our solution, our team sought to create a chassis that can detect, move towards, and kill MRSA. Our detection system utilizes AgrC and AgrA system from S. aureus to detect AIP released from MRSA and activate the P2 promoter. The P2 promoter then initiates motility and the killing mechanism. Movement is controlled by the motility gene, cheZ, which initiates movement towards AIP. Killing is accomplished by genes gakA, gakB, and gakC from Lactococcus garvieae with a secretion signal attached, which produces the bacteriocin garvicin KS for extracellular secretion.

We hypothesize that a genetically modifying E. coli can convert styrene (monomerized polystyrene) to P3HB, a specific PHA, with just two plasmids. Our device will aim to reduce the 30% of plastic waste volume accounted for by polystyrene while simultaneously enabling cost-effective production of PHA.
https://teams.igem.org/3194	WIKI	Monitoring and eliminating heavy metal pollution are critical to our environment. The existing solutions, which usually require bringing soil samples into a lab, are costly and ineffective. Our team implemented multiple MerR-like regulators to drive the expression of the reporter genes and monitor the concentration of several heavy metal cations. Through mathematical modeling, we used an algorithm to take the effect of all ions -- conjugate and non-conjugate -- into count, giving a reliable readout to multiple types of co-existing heavy metal ions and avoiding errors caused by the crosstalk of non-conjugate metal inducers during the quantitative analysis. In addition, we found out that the absorption of heavy metal cadmium by CapB gene enables the removal of cadmium once it is detected. Combining the metal detecting MerR-like regulators and cadmium absorbing CapB, we have devised a prototype to reduce cadmium concentration in soil and address related agricultural and environmental issues.
https://teams.igem.org/3195	Environment	Under the background of global warming and ocean acidification, large scale of Cyanobacteria bloom forming is unavoidable and become a serious global environment problem. Recently, we have found that the unique intracellular digestion mechanism of the Branchiostoma can degrade algae into nutrients such as amino acids and polysaccharides with effectively degradation of harmful substances such as algal toxins. This discovery provides a new perspective and insipration for exploring algae resources. Methods of bioinformatics are applied to further analyze the proteome of Branchiostoma and to screen specific proteins. We will transduct the screened genes into E-coli and design an efficient expression pathway to realize scale processing of algae mud. Gradient experiments will be conducted to explore the optimum reaction ratio and reaction conditions. Furthermore, we will explore its possibility to turn into raw material for animal feed to help fight global hunger. Use earth wisdom, solve earth problem. We are moving!

Chemical banana degumming technology remains the problems of high pollution and cost. HUST-China designed Banamax, an engineering Pichia pastoris that responds to environmental pH &#8203;&#8203;and adaptively regulates the amount of biodegrading enzymes. The construction of high-enzyme activity kits were completed by combining 3 pH-responsive promoters with 6 different signal peptides and 3 biological degumming enzymes. We successfully degraded pectin at pH 7 and degraded lignin at pH 5. Alkali was expressed at pH 2 to buffer the environmental pH and maintain the enzyme activity. Crude fiber has been successfully obtained from banana straw sample in trial, which shows the feasibility of the entire biological intelligent manufacturing system.
https://teams.igem.org/3197	Environment	Plastics are widely used in industry and households because of their low-weight, durability and low-production cost. Nowadays, the consumption of plastics has risen sharply. However, lack of effective waste plastics management poses a major threat to the environment. For the past few years, new technology about biodegradation of plastics has been a hot spot. Polyethylene (PE) and polystyrene (PS) are the most important mass-produced plastics, which are difficult to be degraded by the microorganism. Recently, we observed a strain Microbulbifer hydrolyticus , which has the ability to degrade PE and PS. In this study, we would try to investigate the mechanism of PE biodegradation, and find the key enzymes. Meanwhile, based on the genome sequencing and synthetic biology, we aim to construct an artificial metabolic pathway, engineering this strain to enhance the ability to plastics biodegrading. Furthermore, the strain could utilize plastics to synthetic value-added products, such as PHA, etc.
https://teams.igem.org/3198	Foundational Advance	Engineered organisms are being used to solve global problems today, from cleaning up our environment to diagnosing diseases. Yet, bottlenecks in engineered microbes lie in their limited functional lifespan and inherent stochasticity. We aim to overcome these limitations by engineering an on-off switch for the cells, giving the ability to control their productivity and extend their productive lifespan. Aided by modelling, we developed this switch using Toxin-Antitoxin modules which target global translational process and cellular metabolism to enable dormancy. Our technology allows the insertion of different input control modules to regulate these circuits in a plug-and-play manner. To ensure the safety and retainability of our circuits, a biocontainment module was designed to prevent the unwanted spread of our modules to other organisms. Finally, we successfully demonstrated regulated and lengthened productivity by using luminescence production. Our technology thus pushes the boundaries of Synthetic Biology, bringing it closer to real world adoption.
https://teams.igem.org/3200	High School	We are currently developing a treatment for Parkinson's disease utilizing optogenetics. There were several difficulties in existing methods, such as drug tolerance and other side effects, so we pinpointed the spatiotemporal accuracy of optogenetics as a better solution. We are approaching in two ways. First, we fused protein consisting of opsin and DRD2(dopamine receptor). Light act as DRD2 agonist, thus it triggers the nigrostriatal pathway. The light increases dopamine signaling in PD patients brain. Second, we regulated the expression of ABAT by using the CRISPR-dCas9 system. It prevents neurodegeneration by inactivating GABA, which transmits an excessive inhibitory signal. Moreover, this system is reversible so it is capable of resolving the problem induced by GABA deficiency. If this project is fully developed and applied, it can cure not only PD but also addiction, schizophrenia, and other neurodegenerative diseases.
https://teams.igem.org/3201	New Application	Nowadays, aptamers binding to specific targets are synthesized via SELEX. While effective, SELEX requires specialized equipment, trillions of initial oligonucleotides, and considerable time and cost. Therefore, our team proposes a novel mechanism of aptamer development, MEDEA - Machine Enhanced Directed Evolution of Aptamers. Our project aims to create a platform for the evolution of optimised aptamers, in E. coli cells. The evolution of our aptamer sequence is achieved through the interaction of three modules: the aptamer module, the mutagenesis module and the selection module. The aptamer module contains the aptamer sequence connected to a ribozyme. When the aptamer binds to its target, the ribozyme is activated, cleaving a Small Transcription Activating RNA. The STAR enables the transcription of an antibiotic resistance gene, used for selection. Mutagenesis is performed by the EvolvR system. The first step in our revolutionary pipeline is a software to create highly specific initial aptamers.

Such releases may interfere with the balanced microbial ecosystems before and even destroy the original ecological balance. To solve this problem, our team designed a digitalizing bistable module that can detect and prevent the stealing or release of engineering bacteria form labs or factories.We utilize the mutual bistable system that enable conditional suicide of engineered bacteria. To better function, we use a sensor to sense the change of external environment, a recombinase as a flip to form memory which could record the action of stealing or release, and DNase/toxic protein to decompose the functioning bacteria.
https://teams.igem.org/3204	Diagnostics	The American Foulbrood, caused by Paenibacillus larvae, is the most dangerous bacterial disease facing bees in Austria. The early diagnosis of the American Foulbrood requires a microbiological laboratory, which makes preventative monitoring unpleasant for beekeepers, especially for hobby-beekeepers. We seek to develop a biosensor in order to make it possible for anyone to measure for P. larvae in a relatively short period of time. The sensor should be easy to use, small, affordable and sensitive enough to detect small amounts of bacteria.Bacteriophages are immobilized onto an electrode to provide the necessary specificity. The binding of the P. larvae spores from the probe to the bacteriophages causes a change in the electrical resistance, which can be quantified by electrical impedance spectroscopy.
https://teams.igem.org/3205	New Application	Can your mobile phone record and reproduce smells? At present, we can use mobile phones to record and replay videos and audios. But smells can't be recorded nor reproduced. In our project this year, we aim to design and build a machine composed of an E. coli assay. It can sense smell and store it by converting the smell signal to the accumulation of a small RNA, taRNA, which is accumulated via the positive feedback of the quorum-sensing system. When we want to smell once more, we just need to give another signal to the machine. Along with the accumulated taRNA, the signal will trigger the reproduction of the smell that the E. coli has sensed. The assay can record and reproduce a composite smell. In this way, we can always keep and reproduce the smell we want to remember.
https://teams.igem.org/3206	Diagnostics	Parkinsons Disease is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting an estimated 7 million people worldwide. Current diagnostic procedures rely on observations of late-stage motor symptoms, meaning delays and misdiagnoses occur. For individuals, this means therapies which delay the severity of Parkinsons Disease may not begin until physical symptoms are present. Our project, muninn, investigated the use of biosensors to detect pre-motor symptom biomarkers associated with Parkinsons Disease and how early diagnosis may impact patient health. The project development was informed by patient groups, health professionals and diagnosticians, resulting in a suite of biosensors targeting biomarkers found in clinical samples. We investigated CRISPR SHERLOCK system for detection of a Parkinsons Disease-specific mRNA biomarker, and biosensors for the detection of glutathione and eicosane to increase confidence in an indicative diagnosis. By integrating feedback from clinicians and charities, muninn aims to provide a foundation for developing diagnostic procedures for early-stage Parkinsons Disease.
https://teams.igem.org/3208	Therapeutics	Pathogens, you've been terminated! Our novel synthetic platform for high throughput isolation and characterization of peptides with antimicrobial properties will serve as The Terminator for multi-resistant bacterial pathogens. We are planning on using the available genomic and meta-genomic sequencing data as a source of novel peptide sequences that can be used instead of antibiotics. To identify such elements, we will be using different versions of the BLAST algorithm and known antimicrobial peptides as quarries. The next step would be to have these exact sequences synthesized as an oligonucleotide pool and cloned like an expression library in E.coli. Last but not least, we will be testing the activity of this library against a selected group of indicator strains that represent most of the major important human and animal pathogens as to find the perfect Peptidator!
https://teams.igem.org/3209	High School	Formaldehyde is becoming the top one killer in the indoor chemical pollutants, and it has been identified as carcinogenic and teratogenic substances by the World Health Organization (WHO). Human payed more attention on the removal of indoor formaldehyde, but these removed formaldehyde is released to the environment which is a kind of waste of resources. Xylulose as a metabolic intermediate is the precursor of rare sugars, and its unique pattern of biological activity plays an important role in the fields of food, health, medicine and so on. We found a new pathway for xylulose synthesis from formaldehyde. Two important enzymes benzoylformate decarboxylase mutant BFD-M4 (from Pseudomonas putida) and transaldolase mutant TalB-F178Y (from Escherichia coli) are involved in this pathway in which indoor formaldehyde can be eliminated, and xylulose is produced with formaldehyde.

https://teams.igem.org/3211	Therapeutics	Antibiotic resistant pathogens are a major threat to global health. Emerging superbugs are rapidly becoming resistant to available antibiotics, while the discovery of new antibiotics is falling behind. Phage therapy offers a potential solution that has achieved remarkable successes. However, it is limited by the number of pathogens that can be targeted by available natural phages. To address this limitation, we aim to increase the range of phage specificities. Host specificity is influenced by the affinity of the phages binding protein to the bacterial surface. We developed a system that integrates random codons in phage genomes at any locus of interest. This allows for the formation of phage libraries with novel binding proteins that alter the host spectrum. Our bioreactor selects and evolves the best variants. The observed phage-host interactions can be used to further improve library design. Our system could be the basis for personalized treatment of bacterial infections.

We are focusing on dampening effects of leaky transcription by adding degradation tags to the output protein, as well as testing the sensor with new constructs for detecting different analytes than was previously used with this sensor (Arabinose, Mercury, etc).
https://teams.igem.org/3213	Open	Wax printing is used to fabricate microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (µPADs), which have emerged as promising platforms for developing low-cost diagnostic devices in resource-limited settings. Before such point-of-care devices can be made available for wide-spread use, foundational research is needed to build and test their efficacy. To make wax printing more accessible to educational and research laboratories, the Penn 2019 iGEM team designed, constructed, and validated an open-source wax printing conversion kit for widely used open-source Prusa 3D-printers. The device replaces the existing extruder with a custom-designed, heated, and pneumatically actuated wax extrusion system. G-code transformed from user CAD files (in the PrusaSlicer software) is then converted by a Python script into the necessary commands required by the MIYAGI device.

https://teams.igem.org/3215	Environment	Glyphosate is a synthetic phosponate able to block the EPSPs enzymes in some plant species and is the main active compound of the most used agrochemical worldwide. Anually, more than 170,000 tons of glyphosate are applied over brazillian crops, and a considerable amount is carried by rain to the rivers and lakes. Glyphosate has already been shown to cause mutations in fish, malformation in amphibious species and superreproduction of snail species. There is still a strong debate over its effects to human health. UFRGS_Brazil team aims to engineer Escherichia coli K12 to correct its endogenous C-P lyase operon, remove a repressor and change the promoter region to a constitutive one. We designed a 3D model of a stationary filter to validate our biofiltering system. We also designed a lac-dependent kill-switch to ensure that the genetically engineered bacteria will not survive out of the alginate shells it will be trapped upon.
https://teams.igem.org/3217	North America	Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are electrochemical systems that rely on the reduction potential of organic matter by respiring microorganisms to produce electricity. Our research group was inspired by the 2007 Glasgow teams use of the pyocyanin mediator and Xylr protein to detect BTEX pollutants (xylene, toluene and benzene) with an E- coli based MFC. The reduction-oxidation of pyocyanin can be harnessed by the cells to deposit electrons; If the cells were to respond to a pollutant by producing pyocyanin, we can observe the change in current as an indication of the presence of the pollutant. Our team aims to investigate this sensing system by making the bacteria produce fluorescent proteins in response to the presence of these pollutants. Utilizing change in fluorescence to correlate concentrations. This project will expand the tests done by the Glasgow team to continuously monitor if the mediator and sensor producing genes have retained their function.
https://teams.igem.org/3218	New Application	The Receptor Open Community Kit, or RocKit, takes an innovative new approach to synthesize customised receptors. The RocKit provides researchers with a way of creating receptors for any target and access to a database containing information about all receptors made with the RocKit. Our kit is easy to use, containing all the cells, DNA and buffers to utilise this technology. The system is carried out in yeast which are transformed with the genes for all components in the genetic circuit. We use a system of directed random mutation to simulate accelerated evolution to the binding site of the receptor until it evolves an affinity for the specific target molecule of choice. Our base receptor is designed in such a way as to allow for easy extraction for use in experimentation. All receptor sequences can then be uploaded to the RocCloud to facilitate the creation of an open, information-sharing scientific community.
https://teams.igem.org/3219	High School	Microcystis aeruginosa is one of the most common cyanobacteria responsible for harmful algal blooms. This cyanobacterium produces microcystin, a hepatotoxin that damages the liver. However, direct lysis of Microcystis aeruginosa may not best for the environment as it holds ecological values of heavy metal sorption and oxygen synthesis. We hope to silence the microcystin biosynthesis cluster(mcy) using a catalytically dead Cas9 (dCas9) enzyme lacking endonuclease activity. When the dCas9 enzyme is co-expressed with a guide RNA(sgRNA), the dCas9-sgRNA complex specifically binds to the McyB gene and blocks transcript elongation, leading to the repression of the McyB gene without altering the chromosome of the Microcystis. Here we provide the design of a dCas9-sgRNA expression gene in a shuttle vector that can replicate in both E.coli and cyanobacteria. We will also be conducting downstream analysis to see how our dCas9-sgRNA expression plasmid affects the microcystin-production rate and oxygen synthesis rate of Microcystis.
https://teams.igem.org/3220	Village	The rise of cellular agriculture in New Zealand has inspired us to develop novel strategies to increase the value of milk proteins that will, in the future, be produced using biotechnology. Cow's milk is categorized as one of the main 8 allergens in the western world. Beta-lactoglobulin (BLG), a protein found in both bovine and caprine milk, is a key allergen in the whey fraction of milk. Allergy to proteins like BLG, occurs due to specific proteins keys (amino acid epitope sequences) which initiate an immune response and/or because the protein cannot be easily digested by the body. Our project aims to utilize biotechnology to decrease the allerginicity to milk proteins like BLG. To achieve this, we have produced genetic variants of BLG and will transform E. coli, "hijacking" bacteria to synthesize the variant-proteins. Subsequently, we will purify and run enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in triplicate to screen for allerginicity.

Cordycepin, one of cordyceps militaris' components, has been proved of great clinical potentiality. But its price is too high to afford at approximately 1500 dollars per gram. So, 2019 SCU-China wants to decrease the price of cordycepin by using engineered yeast for factories. We add the delayed expression system to automatically ferment cordycepin and its protector, pentostatin. As a result, we can produce cordycepin in a cheaper and more automatic way.
https://teams.igem.org/3222	Foundational Advance	We, iGEM GIFU_TOKAI, focus on mRNA and changing its topological form into circular to create a new method for mass-production of protein in cell-free system this year. In the current research of circular RNA (circRNA) for protein production, expressing tandem-repeated protein was generated by circRNA without a stop codon. It shows circRNA has a potential ability that it can skip the rate-limiting process of the central dogma of molecular biology, binding ribosomes to mRNA. However, with conventional circRNA, functional protein cannot be translated because protein aggregation quickly occurs. Therefore, we decided to use translation-coupling system, which is found in operons of bacteria to produce monomer protein from circRNA. With applying it to circRNA, ribosomes repeat translation-coupling phenomenon in circRNA and are expected to express monomer protein. Our final goal is to produce functional proteins such as antibodies more efficiently and cheaper in cell-free system to provide medicaments consistently

https://teams.igem.org/3224	Foundational Advance	Transfection is an established technique to transiently modulate gene expression in eukaryotic cells. Liposome-mediated transfection increases cellular endosomal turnover and stimulates carrier induced autophagy. Transfection efficiency of commercially available liposomal reagents is frequently associated with cellular toxicity in a dose-dependent manner. These complications, in addition to its high cost, augment the unmet need for a cost-effective and less-toxic transfection reagent. Cell-Penetrating Peptides (CPPs) are short (<30 amino acids) linear peptides that facilitate the cellular uptake of diverse macromolecules. The broad range of their cellular targets and their limited toxicity qualify them as ideal carriers for cargo delivery. Our current project involves the novel application of a synthetic CPP for the direct delivery of interfering RNA in the context of transient gene silencing. The selected CPP delivers the un-bound cargo through pore formation and gets selectively targeted for proteasomal degradation, thus averting the possibilities of carrier induced autophagy and cytotoxicity.

Pectobacterium carotovorum (Erwinia carotovorum) is a main plant pathogen causing soft rot of potatoes as well as many other crops. We plan to develop an easily-used toolkit based on cell-free system which can detect and prevent the occurrence of soft rot. Two kinds of gene circuits are designed for the detection and prevention. One is to detect AHL (quorum sensing signal molecular) of P. carotovorum; the other is to express the hydrolase AiiA and the antibacterial peptides which could degrade AHL and generally kill bacteria separately. The gene circuits coupling with cell-free expression system are lyophilized on paper and can be used with rehydration.

Many researchers are aiming to solve the problem and have proposed various solutions. However, even today, radioactive contamination has been a serious problem in Japan which we need to solve immediately. From this circumstance, this year, we aim to give E. coli radiation resistance. By inserting three genes that are related to high DNA repair ability and oxidative stress tolerance from one of radiation-resistant microbes, we search for more effective way to make E.coli survive in the environment of high radiation dosage. If we combine this E.coli with other technologies, we can develop innovative solutions to purify polluted water, collecting rare metal, and so on. High DNA repair ability can also be used to improve cloning technology(in Vivo E.coli Cloning).
https://teams.igem.org/3228	Foundational Advance	While most iGEM teams were working with conventional chassis like E. coli and S. cerevisiae, phototrophic organisms were always underrepresented. To make it more feasible for other teams to work with phototrophic organisms, a fast growing and easy to handle chassis is necessary. For this purpose we establish Synechococcus elongatus UTEX 2973 with a reported doubling time of 90min - as a viable chassis by developing strains tailored to various applications. Therefore, we restore its natural competence, establish the CRISPR/Cpf1 system for multiplexed genome engineering and enable the utilization of plasmids as a tool for rapid design testing. Furthermore, we expand last years Golden Gate based MoClo toolbox, and accelerate the complete cloning workflow by automating plating, colony picking and plasmid purification on the Opentrons OT-2. By providing our fast phototrophic chassis to the community, we would like to pave the way for other phototrophic organisms in synthetic biology.
https://teams.igem.org/3229	Village	Microcystis is a genus of cyanobacteria frequently causing harmful algal blooms and water toxicity. Our purpose is to detect the presence of microcystin, a hepatotoxin produced by Microcystis aeruginosa under certain conditions. Microcystin is synthesized nonribosomally via microcystin synthetase encoded by the mcy genes. We have constructed plasmids where, after the promoter region, mcy genes are replaced with GFP genes. We would like to transform the plasmids into M. aeruginosa and Escherichia coli using shuttle plasmids. Upon addition of the transformed bacteria to wild-type M. aeruginosa cultures, we expect that the inserted GFP genes will be transcribed due to cell-to-cell communication. By taking samples from the growing cultures, we can determine the algae concentration which microcystin starts to be produced at. For further studies, since its sequence is unknown, we are going to sequence the promoter of mcy genes of Microcystis flos-aquae, another species abundant in Hungarian lakes.

Currently, the most advanced treatment for cancer is immunotherapy. Interleukin 2 (IL-2) stimulates the growth and activity of T-lymphocytes to boost immune system. Use of an inhibitor that blocks the interaction of PD-L1 with the PD-1 receptor can prevent the cancer from evading the immune system. Our product targets both IL-2 and PD-L1, implementing a trap between Tumor and T cells. We evaluate the efficacy of our bi-functional fusion protein by the binding assay and T cell proliferation assay, as well as killing assay. In order to solve the short half-life and acute toxicity of IL-2, we apply Poly-&#947;-glutamic acid hydrogels to encapsulate the fusion protein to achieve sustained release effect. This study sheds light on clinical treatment of breast cancer, improving the quality of life of postoperative patients.

https://teams.igem.org/3236	New Application	Flip recombinase is a versatile and important recombinase enzyme with broad applications in molecular genetic applications. Flip recombinase has been used to induce genetic mutations in vivo in numerous model organisms including bacteria, Drosophila, Zebrafish, and mouse and human cells. However, Flip recombinase activity is binary and thus cannot be precisely activated in time and space. Utilizing light-sensitive protein interaction domains termed magnets, we have developed a light-sensitive optogenetic variant of Flip recombinase that can be controlled in Escherichia coli with exquisite spatiotemporal precision. We believe this Opto-Flip recombinase has the potential to be utilized in multiple model organisms and will provide a novel tool allowing for precise molecular-genetic control for numerous future research and industrial applications.
https://teams.igem.org/3237	Manufacturing	Diabetes, a disease caused by abnormal insulin regulation and production, affects approximately 8.8% of the population. Currently, subcutaneous injection of recombinant insulin is used to self-regulate abnormal blood glucose levels, a treatment that is painful and often prohibitively expensive for patients. Oral insulin alternatives are not yet a cost-effective alternative because the unprotected insulin is rapidly degraded by acidic stomach conditions and so there remains an unmet demand for low-cost methods of manufacturing oral insulin and/or novel methods for delivering insulin directly to the intestines. We are developing an edible recombinant microalgae strain called Algulin that produces either an ultrastable oral insulin analog or proinsulin peptides. Algulin reduces manufacturing costs by eliminating the need for insulin extraction and purification, improves efficacy over previous oral insulins by acting as a protective capsule and shielding the insulin from degradation, and eliminates uncomfortable injections for diabetic patients.
https://teams.igem.org/3238	Environment	Nowadays the excessive production of CO&#8322; is causing a phenomenon called ocean acidification (OA) which combined with tons of plastics in the ocean are both main problems in the marine environment. Through genetically transformation, E. coli BL-21 bacterium will combine the capability of plants to get CO&#8322; from the marine environment (decreasing the OA) and the skill from some bacterium to degradate of vegetable waste in order to have sugar source. Both processes are vital in order to produce great pyruvate quantities to get polyhydroxybutyrate, which is used to produce bioplastics that could replace the prevailing polymer . For maintaining the Pyruvate production and photorespiration in the highest and lowest level, respectively we will design a system which works under anaerobic conditions and repress the aerobic metabolism using arcA protein and for measuring the pyruvate production we design a biosensor.

However, in such P. pastoris, the metabolism of methanol is highly specific and results in significant oxygen consumption and heat generation, which have limited its industrial applications. We aim to address this issue by maximizing the methanol conversion rate in P. pastoris by re-engineering its homogenous circuits expressing the transcription factors that would up-regulate the expression of AOX1, the protein allowing it to metabolize methanol. Our preliminary results have demonstrated that one of our constructs does achieve an up to 41% increase in the expression level of the reporter gene GFP. We also validated our design by building a mathematic simulation of an industrial setting.

https://teams.igem.org/3241	Energy	Our project aims to build up biological parts in Zymomonas mobilis for converting waste cartons into Poly-&#946;-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) and biofuels. For Z. mobilis engineering, we express the cellulosome in the Z. mobilis to construct CBP strains that can directly utilize cellulose, because it cannot grow normally in media with cellulose as a single carbon source. In addition, a reporter-gene system established for Z. mobilis is used to effectively characterize biological parts, and Oligo-linker mediated assembly (OLMA) method is applied for the assembly of biological parts. Moreover, through a newly developed CRISPR-cas guided gene editing technology, assembled biological parts are integrated into the genome of Z. mobilis. Finally, in order to create a highly predictable gene expression pattern to generate a high flux of transcription, we need establish a biophysical model to predict the correlation between regulatory parts such as promoter and terminator sequences with their strength on gene expression.
https://teams.igem.org/3242	Food & Nutrition	Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is a highly toxic metabolite that is known to contaminate peanut crops and is responsible for a number of health complications within Georgia. An inducible expression system that can isolate aflatoxin affected crops was engineered using the Gal4/UAS system and single-chain variable fragments (ScFvs). Gal4 is a transcriptional factor that binds to an upstream activating sequence (UAS), which in turn drives the expression of a downstream gene. The primary gene of interest was BS3, an apoptotic initiator derived from C. annuum. The binding and activating domains of Gal4 were each fused to a unique ScFv that is specific to AFB1. Upon exposure to AFB1, each ScFv will bind to AFB1 and allow Gal4 to induce indirect expression of BS3. All in all, the Gal4/UAS system is a novel idea in the field of plant pathology and holds great potential to enhance peanut production within Georgia.
https://teams.igem.org/3243	Village	When farmers spray phosphate fertilizer on crops, the excess will leach to the underground, contaminating the water and resulting eutrophication which threatens many lives. Fertilizer pollution spreads globally, especially in developing countries where agriculture still holds economic dominance, although some countries have started to deal with the problem. We find that acetylcholinesterase is an enzyme which catalyzes the reaction converting P fertilizer to phosphoric acid. Therefore, we can use acetylcholinesterase to measure the concentration of Phosphate in water by detecting the level of PH. Our goal in this research is to produce acetylcholinesterase by bioengineering. We insert the ACHE gene in mouse into multi-clone vector pGEX-4T-1 with restrictive enzymes PluTI and BspQI, and then fuse it with E.coli. After expressing AChE, we assembly it into a PH device which corresponds P-fertilizer level with PH. In this way, people could learn the level of fertilizer pollution in water.

Egypt ranks 10th amongst the countries with highest bladder cancer incidence rates. This has been attributed to endemic parasitic infestation with Schistosoma Hematobium. Schistosomiasis-associated bladder cancer constitutes 60% of cases. In our project, we aimed to engineer the chimeric antigen receptor T-cells capable of targeting schistosomiasis-associated bladder cancer cells as well as overcoming the immuno-suppressive conditions associated with the tumor microenvironment. To achieve this purpose, we devised a computational framework for antibody design producing single chain variable fragments which target intracellular antigens. We then engineered dual 4th generation TanCAR-T cells (using CRISPR-CAS9) with enhanced cytokine production and a dual functionality against cancer cells as well as the egg form of the parasite. We also optimized the CAR design by directed silencing of exhaustiveness-inducing transcription factors utilizing a computational pipeline for designing and optimizing silencing RNAs cassettes.
https://teams.igem.org/3245	Therapeutics	This year, our team intend to remold E.coli Nissle1917, a kind of commonly used probiotic, to provide a universal platform for intestinal metabolic disease treatment. We introduced 3 important features to improve curative effect in vivo: high competitiveness against intestinal symbiotic as well as harmful bacteria, strong stress resistance against gastric environment, and the ability to control its own flora scale. In our project, we apply our system to solve lactose intolerance, a common disease that affects living quality of 80% Chinese, according to the National Measurement Institute. We show that our platform provides a novel, long lasting solution to this disease. By applying our platform, Nissle1917 can colonize in human gut for longer period of time, while in the meantime express higher level of lactase. This means that the rate of taking bacteria preparations will largely reduce, thus creating a more patient-friendly therapeutic approach to lactose intolerance.
https://teams.igem.org/3246	Manufacturing	The vast chemical diversity of plant specialized metabolites has provided a historically long-standing avenue for humankind to access natural products with pharmacologically active properties. Many plants that were domesticated during ancient times for their medicinal and psychoactive value are currently known to produce nitrogenous bicyclic phytochemicals classified as tropane alkaloids (TAs). Examples of notable TAs include atropine and scopolamine, which are listed as essential medicines by the World Health Organization, and even the notoriously addictive stimulant, cocaine. The commercial demand for TAs is largely supplied through plant extraction as the enzymes responsible for the formation of tropinone, an intermediate metabolite central to the biosynthesis of many TAs, were controversial for nearly a century. With the recent elucidation of these enzymes and the increasing global demand for medicinal TAs, we investigate the potential of E. coli as a platform strain for the biosynthesis of TAs.
https://teams.igem.org/3247	Environment	Recent changes in climate patterns pose an enormous threat to the agricultural industry. Increasing temperatures and lower soil water content systematically decrease crop yields. This project aimed to tackle this problem from the bottom up by engineering a common soil bacterium, Pseudomonas putida, to overexpress plant growth-promoting enzymes under a temperature-dependent system. P. putida, with its known root interactions with Arabidopsis thaliana, was utilized to promote plant growth through the production of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase, and trehalose synthase. A program that couples genetic algorithms and NUPACK was created to design and optimize low temperature RNA thermometers. These thermometers with melting temperatures around 30°C induced the translation of the enzymes to ensure optimal resource usage for the bacteria. Maximizing crop yields now will ensure better food availability and distribution in the future.

However, fewer than 5% of iGEM teams have used mammalian cells in their projects. We examined the factors hindering the accessibility of mammalian synthetic biology, focusing on challenges that limit the rapid prototyping of synthetic systems. Specifically, we worked to simplify the process of characterizing mammalian parts and devices. Through our work characterizing the transfer functions of endogenous gene expression for light-activated CRISPR/dCas9-based effector (LACE) systems, we developed generalizable methods and tools that have application for LACE and other device classes. Our toolkit allowed us to make quantitative comparisons between multiple device variants and to explore the contextual dependence of device function in different cell lines and for multiple genes. We share our methods and propose these foundational advances may help accelerate the spread of mammalian synthetic biology throughout iGEM and beyond.

Hence, our iGEM project aims to tackle this challenge by featuring RNA editing as a safer alternative to DNA editing. By incorporating feedback from our human practices, we decided to improve upon our RNA editing project from last year and include the analysis of off-targets as a safety component. We aim to identify a dCas13-ADAR2 (Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA) fusion protein that has high RNA editing activity and high specificity (low off-targets), with future applications in therapeutics and research.
https://teams.igem.org/3251	Food & Nutrition	Expiration dates on food reflect the range of time when products are at their best nutritional value. To prevent consuming spoiled products, many consumers throw food away after the expiration dates. However, these dates are not an accurate indicator of spoilage, and this ambiguity adds to the food waste problem. To mitigate this, we developed a paper-based biosensor that consumers can use at home to assess their milk for spoilage. Our device detects the quorum-sensing molecules, acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL), produced by spoilage bacteria, both of which increase in concentration as spoilage progresses. Our detection system visualizes high AHL levels with the expression of pigment proteins. Additionally, to ensure food safety, a cell-free system was implemented such that no live genetically-engineered bacteria will be introduced to the consumer product.
https://teams.igem.org/3252	Environment	Vibrio parahaemolyticus, an emerging pathogen of white shrimp that cause White Feces Disease (WFD), still poses major threat in white shrimp industry. Unfortunately, Vibrio parahaemolyticus is hard to detect; shrimp farmers tries to estimate its existence through physicochemical and traditional parameters which does not always give accurate prediction. We design Escherichia coli that could detect Vibrio parahaemolyticus in shrimp pond water and estimates its quantity. We try to express the signaling proteins of Vibrio parahaemolyticus in Escherichia coli: LuxN, LuxO, and LuxU and integrate them with dCas9 system that regulates GFP expression. It is expected that when the Vibrio parahaemolyticus level is high, it would produce enough autoinducer molecules to be detected by LuxN and induces the cascade of the system until GFP is expressed. This system would allow shrimp farmers to detect Vibrio parahaemolyticus in their ponds earlier and easier, hence they could do preventive measures to stop WFD.
https://teams.igem.org/3253	High School	Our project uses agrobacteria to produce chitinase in tobacco leaves in order to help resist insects infection. Chitin is the composition of insects exoskeleton and digestion tract. Chitinase can decompose chitin and hence reduce insect infection. This method can be used as a green pesticide which doesnt damage the environment. The agrobacteria can transfer part of its plasmid into plant genome, which is the T-DNA. We inserted the chitinase gene into the vector pCAMBIA 2301 and adopted a binary system. We first let the vector amplify in E.coli DH5&#945;. Then, we extracted the plasmids and inserted them into agrobacteria tumefacien GV3101. The bacteria can be injected into tobacco leaves and contribute to a brand new ability to defend against pests.
https://teams.igem.org/3254	High School	Generally, the relay, the key component of electrical automatic control system, receives the output signal of a control module and thus shifts the ON/OFF state of a separated working module. Based on the integrase-attB/attP system and unidirectional terminator, we constructed a set of orthogonal biological relay devices, whose response intervals were characterized by accurate quantifying method so that they can be predictably adapted to different genetic circuits. We designed and constructed a resolution extensible analog-digital converter (ADC), which converts the consecutive analog quantities (the strength of an inducible promoter) into discrete digital signals (indicated by different chromoproteins), allowing the digitized processing and storage of signals. Beyond the common use of recombinase system as simple response to two input levels, our project achieves modifying and utilizing the response interval of this system. The application of relay in genetic circuit can contribute to the improvement of the modularity of artificial biological system.
https://teams.igem.org/3255	Village	The use of natural and sustainable inks in many different applications such as printer cartridges, pens or textile dyeing is currently limited by two important factors. On the one hand, although pigments can be extracted and purified easily from fruits or vegetables, the use of food for these purposes is not a sustainable practice. On the other hand, natural pigments are prone to oxidation, which severely affect color stability. Therefore, as a proof of concept, we propose a synthetic biology approach in which bacteria are genetically programmed to synthesize enzymes capable of catalyzing the transformation of color precursors into pigments. Oxidation of these pigments can then be prevented by either chemical or physical strategies. We explore both the use of a yeast cell-free system as a chemical anti-oxidant and the encapsulation of the resultant pigments to prevent their oxidation using physical barriers.
https://teams.igem.org/3256	Environment	Gene mutation can lead to cancer in human cells, however nowadays the detection of mutation is time-consuming and difficult. Thus, this year NCTU_Formosa develops an easy-use mutation detection and prediction platform with an education kit. We named it E. Phoenix. First, E. coli expresses the suicide gene. Once the suicide gene is mutated, the population will rise, and the RFP signal will show by Quorum Sensing. Next, the growth curve analytic model can transform the signal into mutation frequency. We also built up a mutation frequency prediction model based on chemical structure. We can compare the detection result from our device with already known mutagens. After collecting our results, we design an education kit to provide a more understandable data presentation. Different results from different samples turn into the speed of racing cars. By comparing its rate, the public can compare mutation frequency among different testing objects easily.
https://teams.igem.org/3257	Foundational Advance	Mutation library generation is critical for biological and medical research, but current methods cannot mutate a specific sequence continuously without manual intervention. We hereby present a toolbox for in vivo continuous mutation library construction. First, the target DNA is transcribed into RNA. Next, our reverse transcriptase (RT) reverts RNA into cDNA, during which the target is randomly mutated by our RT's enhanced error-prone ability. Finally, the mutated version replaces the original sequence through recombination. These steps will be carried out iteratively, generating a random mutation library of the target with high efficiency as mutations accumulate along with bacterial growth. Our toolbox is orthogonal and provides a wide range of applications among various species. R-Evolution could mutate coding sequences and regulatory sequences, which enables the evolution of individual proteins or multiple targets at a time, promotes high-throughput research, and serves as a foundational advance to synthetic biology.
https://teams.igem.org/3258	WIKI	The current paradigm of part creation, characterization, and documentation is extremely rate-limiting for scientific discovery. The 2019 Stanford iGEM team envisions an alternative model for facile part creation where final genetic device performance necessarily conforms to initial design specifications. To make this future a reality, we focused on developing self-selecting systems (SSS): directed evolution platforms that selectively amplify the genotypes corresponding to desirable phenotypes. Specifically, we developed Directed Chassis-agnostic Evolution, or DiCE, a novel, easy-to-implement selection-based directed evolution platform built off Qbeta replicase, an RNA-based RNA polymerase, capable of evolving proteins in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, we generated standard selection schema compatible with PREDCEL (Heidelberg 2017) to expand the range of synthetic biological parts that can be created by any SSS. Taken together, our work on SSS presents a foundational advance towards a future where part creation is easier, faster, and more accessible.
https://teams.igem.org/3259	New Application	&#12288;A variety of sophisticated patterns on the body of animals touches a chord. Many of them can be almost reproduced based on the theory called Turing Patterns. Previously, the patterns cannot be formed unless the organism goes through inherent developmental stages. Our team applies the method of synthetic biology and engineers Escherichia coli whose group can produce Turing patterns. A few previous studies did not approach the recreation of natural environment where the presence of physical stimuli has a profound effect on the development of organisms. Thus, we fine-tuned the behavior of bacteria so that temperature and light can play a major role in the formation of pattern. One of the most familiar example of Turing pattern expressed on human body is a fingerprint. Our team also creates a new model that can regenerate a missed part of fingerprint to enhance the value of stochastic pattern formed in wet lab.
https://teams.igem.org/3260	North America	Astronauts rely on regular shipments of medication from Earth because drugs degrade; this is an unsustainable practice for long-term manned missions. Our solution is the Astropharmacy  an on-demand production system for protein-based drugs. The Astropharmacy comprises diagnostics, drug production, and purification. Within diagnostics, we enhanced paper-based microfluidics by innovating hydrophobic protein-based ink to 3D print microfluidic channels, improving resolution from wax-based channels. We designed genetic templates to produce insulin, teriparatide, and hG-CSF using cellular systems to harnesses the speed of VmaxTM, long-term viability of Bacillus subtilis, and production capability of E.coli, and commercial and lab-developed cell-free systems for their adaptability. Lyophilization techniques were applied to preserve the stability of the Astropharmacy at ambient temperatures. Drug production and purification were implemented on 3D-printed expression and PDMS purification microfluidic chips. The construction of the Astropharmacy was guided by insight from industry experts, astronauts, and doctors.

https://teams.igem.org/3262	Environment	This project aims to develop tools for bioremediation of estrogenic pollutants by utilizing an algal-bacterial consortium. The project involves expression of laccase enzymes to degrade these phenolic pollutants, and enhance this process in presence of a mediator compound which is produced by metabolically engineered bacteria. The system also can be used to quantify the concentration of estrogen by combining the laccase-mediator system with an engineered bio-sensor which induces expression of a reporter gene in presence of estrogen. In addition to targeting endocrine disruptors, Algae also provide a wastewater treatment solution, lowering Biological and chemical oxygen demand, and removing excess nutrients like phosphate and nitrate sources from the water. The project utilises computational modelling and simulations to predict the degradation of target compounds, and quantify estrogen concentration. In addition to computational modelling, the project also involves in-vitro chemical analysis, and the assembly of the biological constructs by cloning and their characterization.
https://teams.igem.org/3263	Open	Artificial intelligence has become a hot topic for years, as it has the potential to provide a general tool for solving different problems. However, the area complexity and power cost of traditional silicon-based circuits implementation of artificial neural networks have somehow limited its application. To implement artificial neural networks more efficiently, DNA computing provides an alternative to silicon-based circuits, due to its high computation parallelism and low energy cost. In this project, we propose and demonstrate molecular computation models for basic arithmetic operations in artificial neural networks, based on which we synthesize basic neural networks with DNA reactions. We developed a webpage tool that generates DNA reactions and relevant DNA sequences according to the required parameters of neural networks. Therefore, users can use this tool to obtain expected DNA-based artificial neural networks, which may help them with further molecular computer design and bio-robot design.
https://teams.igem.org/3264	High School	Spider silk serves as a new material with superior properties that can be applied in medication, cloth, and aerospace fields. However, spider breeding is not applicable due to spider's fierce behavior. The current approach is to produce recombinant spidroins (silk proteins) from other chassis and spin them into silk. This year, we aim to manufacture recombinant spider silk with E.coli and color the silk for application in cloth industry. We modularized three significant domains of spidroin - the N-terminal, the repetitive region, and the C-terminal - and integrated them into various spidroin to form silk. We then dyed the silk with microbial natural pigments deoxyviolacein and indigo. To obtain better color and a more convenient dying process, we fused the repetitive region to chromoproteins and mixed them with spidroin during spinning. Our team hopes to provide a novel approach for cloth production and explore new possibilities for spider silk applications.
https://teams.igem.org/3265	New Application	We are constructing a large protein cage within bacteria that can be used to confine and compartmentalize biochemical reactions with potential toxic intermediate products. Bacterial microcompartments (BMCs) are currently the main tool for compartmentalizing bacterial cells and biochemical reactions. Our protein cage could overcome the current limitations of BMCs, which are very small in size and can only hold up to two different enzyme types so far. To produce this protein cage, we are taking a minimal component approach to replicate a natural phage-bacteria interaction. The phage we are working with encapsulates its DNA into a protein cage upon infection of the host bacteria. By using multiple approaches such as microscopy, sequence analysis and in-vitro essays we try to assess which proteins are necessary to form the protein cage. We then co-express promising candidate genes in the host and evaluate the results via microscopy.
https://teams.igem.org/3267	New Application	Fish scales are actually capable of producing electric potential, and we believe that this feature is best utilized in a tissue scaffold. Fish scales are rigid and can uphold structure during tissue development, are piezoelectric and can initiate signaling interactions by electric potential with certain modulators, and are biocompatible as they are mainly made of collagen. In our iGEM experiments, we have proved two major points to show the feasibility of our idea: fish scales can produce electricity by mechanical stress; bacterial cells can be controlled by electric potentials to perform complex signaling pathways. Furthermore, we have applied feedback from experts to improve our own experiments and advance our ideas to the next step, such as creating a more complex tissue regeneration system.
https://teams.igem.org/3268	New Application	Volatile organic metabolites can be generated in many human samples through distinct metabolic pathways. Increasing research evidence indicates that patients bodies give off unique Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) in different stages of human diseases. Therefore, VOCs are considered as potential biomarkers for performing non-invasive and patient-friendly disease screening in the early stages. This year, NYMU-Taipei iGEM team has taken tuberculosis disease as an example and created intracellularly expressed and surface-displayed odorant-binding proteins to detect and monitor the volatile biomarkers from the patients bodies. We have immobilized expressed olfactory receptor proteins to paper device prototypes to detect heptanal which is a specific VOC from tuberculosis patients. Here, we provide an example to demonstrate the feasibility of using odorant biosensors to perform non-invasive early disease screening. Our device prototypes with immobilized olfactory receptor proteins show specific bindings with heptanal. This method is also friendly to children/babies and severely ill patients.
https://teams.igem.org/3269	Diagnostics	As a result of various ozone-depleting substances progressively damaging our planets atmosphere, UV exposure from sunlight is at an all-time high, resulting in an increased incidence of skin cancer in many populated areas. To increase the awareness of the potential health risks of extended UV exposure, we developed an educational kit that can visualize UV-induced DNA damage. Specifically, we utilized a global DNA repair mechanism, called the SOS response, which can be activated by a type of DNA damage known as cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers. Upon exposure to sunlight, the kit produces GFP via a UV-inducible promoter that is found in the SOS response pathway. An educational kit incorporating this low-cost and easy-to-use biosensor teaches students about the risks of UV exposure and how biology can be engineered to illustrate the impact of these issues.
https://teams.igem.org/3270	High School	Contamination of aquatic and terrestrial environments with crude oil is a global issue. Crude oil contains polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), compounds that are difficult to degrade and environmentally toxic. To combat these compounds, a novel methodology was designed for PAH and other hydrocarbon bioremediation from various catabolic pathways upstream of innocuous intermediates. Resulting intermediates are ultimately employed anaerobically to convert into dissolved hydrogen fuel. Hydrogen synthesis is also fueled by pathways that metabolize n-chained hydrocarbons. HORIZON 2.0 also utilizes pathways for the degradation of salicylate and phthalate, compounds that resulted from previous PAH degradation constructs but are unusable by E. coli. To modulate between the various conditions for degradation and synthesis, a positively regulated magnesium riboswitch and novel synthetic CRISPRi operators under riboswitch regulation were designed for use as synthetic operators. Ultimately, this project allows broad spectrum transformation of PAHs and other hydrocarbons within crude oil into usable energy.
https://teams.igem.org/3271	Foundational Advance	The BioBrickTM Standard 10 was updated to allow site-directed chromosomal modification in E. coli. This design is incompatible with Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In this project, we develop a library of flexible plasmids that adhere to the Standard and Type IIS Assembly and that allow for the systematic and efficient cloning of a desired gene within target yeast chromosomal loci, while maintaining the plasmids compatibility with E. coli. Our plasmid library targets the Ade2, His3, Ade4, and Gal4 loci, and is equipped with KanMX, NatMX, Ura3, and His3 yeast-selectable markers as well as RFP to enable colorimetric selection in E. coli. We use our experimental procedure to develop simple protocols to allow individuals with minimal laboratory experience to reproduce and expand our library. Finally, we endeavour to expedite and reduce the cost of cloning by making a DIY Gibson Assembly kit, in which all the required enzymes are harvested in the laboratory.
https://teams.igem.org/3272	Asia	The Opossum is an animal with outstanding resistance to toxins, snake venoms in particular. This anti-venom ability is gained through a single protein; the Lethal Toxin Neutralizing Factor (LTNF). We are attempting to produce an improved synthetic and cost-effective version of the active domain of the protein as a synthetic anti-venom for human use. VenomXL incorporates the power of the post-translational modification processes primarily methylation or acetylation on critical locations of the active polypeptide of the LTNF that improved target affinity. The synthetic polypeptide is then circularized, a process that comprises of adding cysteine amino acids to both ends of a polypeptide chain; triggering the formation of a disulphide bridge, ultimately leading to a circular structure. Circularized synthetic peptides are known for not only greater stability but also greater efficacy thereby improving its shelf life and lowering the required dosage for treatment, ultimately providing a more efficient bioproduct.
https://teams.igem.org/3273	New Application	Mars is a prime destination for humanity to settle down, but the planet is dominated by a high incidence of radiation. The establishment of a colony there requires overcoming several challenges, including the need for in situ food and energy production. To solve these problems, we have engineered a fermenting yeast able to amass melanin on its surface to become resistant to ultraviolet radiation using a yeast display consisting of the protein Aga2 and the peptide 4D, which has a high affinity for melanin, that provides protection against ultraviolet radiation, since melanin is known to absorb this kind of radiation. This technology could also improve fermenting processes on Earth, considering sugar-alcohol plants lose much of their yeast in bioreactors due to contamination. Therefore, the implementation of an ultraviolet sterilization process with a resistant yeast would be profitable to this industry. A glucose-based Kill Switch was developed for biosafety issues.
https://teams.igem.org/3275	Environment	Heavy metals, such as arsenic and cobalt, are a continued concern in industrial facilities and agricultural areas. The goal of this project was to find a cost-effective, biological means of remediating these heavy metals to meet EPA standards. To this end, a two plasmid system has been implemented in BL21 (DE3) E. coli cells, involving metallothionein (MT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) genes. Metallothioneins work to bind and effectively inactivate the heavy metals, while SOD genes have been implemented to decrease the sensitivity of the cells to the effects of heavy metal poisoning by reactive oxygen species, thereby extending the life cycle of the engineered bacteria.
https://teams.igem.org/3276	High School	The honeybee, Apis mellifera, is an important pollinator that is suffering from a crisis called Colony Collapse Disorder. This causes drastic declines in bee populations, disrupting wild ecosystems and global agriculture. In this study, a primary CCD culprit, imidacloprid, is detoxified via paratransgenesis. Using this technique, the midgut bacteria of the bee are engineered to express a cytochrome p450, rendering the bee resistant to the insecticide. By attaching the reporter phoA to the insecticide-resistance gene, CYP6AY1, found in Nilaparvata lugens, the expression of the protein can be monitored. The signal sequence pelB is used to secrete the protein into the bee gut, where it can metabolize the imidacloprid. Once this system successfully functions in-vitro, the transgenic bacteria can be introduced to the bee orally and monitored for significant effects. We hypothesize that this treatment will increase the survival rate of A. mellifera when exposed to imidacloprid.
https://teams.igem.org/3277	Village	Huanglongbing (HLB) is an infection of the bacterium Candidatus liberibacter asiaticus (CLas) that compromises the immune system of host citrus plants. It is introduced to the citrus plant when the asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri feeds on the plants sap. CLas migrates from insect gut into the phloem through the psyllids saliva. Pesticide and antibiotic have disastrous long term effects in the form of ecological destruction and creation of antibiotic resistant soil bacteria. We improved upon the work of the 2017 TecCEM team, using a modification of their system to silence critical psyllid development genes using siRNA. We targeted arginine kinase and superoxide dismutase, and we explored the use of whole bacteria instead of purified siRNA to treat plants. We envision delivery via a trap that contains the RNase minus E.coli/siRNA-producing cassette. We hope to slow down the spread of CLas through the reduction of psyllid populations.
https://teams.igem.org/3278	Village	Type 2 diabetes (T2D) has become an increasing public health problem worldwide. Its existing treatments, including insulin/GLP-1 injections and other drugs, are inconvenient and expensive. N-acyl amides are a family of small molecules secreted by resident enterobacteria to relieve T2D. Thus, ShanghaiTech_China team aims to engineer a smart enterobacteria system that can be fed in glucose values to control the production of N-acyl amides for diabetic alleviation. Using E. coli as a demo, we cloned the synthase for N-palmitoyl serinol, the most potent group in N-acyl amides, into the E. coli expressing plasmid under a light-controllable promoter. Then, we designed a software and LED device that can accept glucose signals from T2D patients to control the synthase expression, which leads to the production of the therapeutic molecule. Together, with INSULEN, we offered a convenient, cheap and smart way to battle against T2D and proved it in principle.
https://teams.igem.org/3279	WIKI	China produces billions of tons of stalks per year. The crop stalks are abundant in cellulose, which would be an efficient carbon source. However, due to high utilization cost, low added value and low industrialization, the bulk of stalks are burned, which wastes resources and causes severe environmental pollution. Astaxanthin, one of the strongest antioxidants in nature, has broad market prospects and high commercial value, providing us with an ideal destination of stalks utilization. In our project, E. coli cells are engineered to consume cellulose as the carbon source and produce astaxanthin. To achieve this goal, three cellulose-degrading enzymes are anchored to E. coli cells outer membranes, while an astaxanthin synthesis pathway is constructed by transferring six additional enzymes to E. coli cells. In this way, we can transform stalks into astaxanthin in only one step, which may offer novel ideas for the reutilization and conversion of the biomass.
https://teams.igem.org/3280	Village	Mercury is a heavy metal that causes environmental and health damage when carelessly disposed. Industries and mining companies frequently discard mercury into nature along with its waste. In the past 4 years, Brazil has suffered two disasters associated with mining dams (Mariana-MG and Brumadinho-MG). The metal-contaminated mud released from the dams reached neighboring rivers, causing severe social and health impact on the local population. This project aims to create a mercury collecting water biofilter using genetically engineered Escherichia coli which express five proteins: a chimera, three secretion machinery units and a bacterial biofilm inducer. Furthermore, the biofilm will grow in green coconut fiber, a cheap abundant material that facilitates the removal of bacteria from the environment. This fiber is already used as a filter for other metals, contributing to filtering efficiency. Consequently, besides allowing mercury's removal from water, our project grants the reuse of an abundant brazilian product.
https://teams.igem.org/3281	New Application	Tissue engineered vascular grafts (TEVGs), used instead of autografts for surgeries such as coronary artery bypass, fail most frequently due to atherosclerosis and thrombus formation. Resulting partial occlusion of a blood vessel increases the shear stress experienced by its walls to levels far beyond the physiological norm. We are developing a system in endothelial cells of three shear mechanosensing proteins with different sensitivities. Activation of each drives expression of distinct fluorescent reporters. We link activation to response by adapting the TANGO assay as well as the Calmodulin/Calcineurin-NFAT pathway. This system could eventually be used to secrete therapeutic agents under pathologically high shear stress, such that engineered cells seeded in TEVGs could respond to and treat local occlusions. We have worked to assemble the genetic constructs that comprise the system, and hope to demonstrate their function within microfluidics and TEVG settings.

We propose to remedy long-term poisoning with Prodeacc - a genetically modified probiotic bacteria absorbing and accumulating toxic metals for you. By introducing proteins found in Cupriavidus metallidurans and E. coli K12 to a probiotic chassis, Escherichia coli Nissle 1917, our transgenic bacteria could accumulate arsenic and lead. As shown in our model, this has the potential of relieving the user from harm caused by the toxic metals. The following proteins were inserted into a pUC19 plasmid and used for the accumulation of lead: pbrD, pbrT, alongside a T7 and Tac promoters. For arsenic, the following proteins were used: arsR, a fusion of arsR and MBP (maltose-binding protein) protein, alongside a T7 and Tac promoters.

In 2018, new cases of lung cancer account for 30.023 cases and the numbers are estimated to go up each year. Based on that fact, an effective, rapid, and accurate diagnostic method is needed to change the patient recovery rate in treating lung cancer. The gold standard of diagnosing lung cancer right now is histopathological examination with the specimen is obtained by biopsy. Nevertheless, biopsy has lots of disadvantages such as misdiagnosis and invasive. The writers proposed a non-invasive serological diagnostic tool, CEAgar. The purpose of this project is to create a CEA detecting diagnostic tool through genetically engineered plasmid with Escherichia coli as the vector which can express transforming growth factor-beta receptor type 1 (TGFRBR1), a natural CEA receptor found in human body.

The current methods for performing directed evolution come with certain limitations, such as instability of hypermutator strains, toxicity of chemical mutagens and inability to evolve gene networks with error prone PCR. Our project aims to overcome these problems by developing a self-regulated system which can achieve tunable mutation rates in E.coli. To demonstrate the working of the system and to address a pressing local issue of lead pollution in water bodies, we aim to develop a lead biosensor and evolve a lead bioremediating strain for higher efficiency using our tool.

This pathogen is wiping out economically important crops, including olives and grapevine, with no effective cure found yet. Currently, the containment methods for this disease are pre-emptively burning trees and using high doses of pesticides. Our team, Xylencer, develops an effective solution for this disease by using bacteriophage therapy for X. fastidiosa. To overcome current limitations, including UV degradation of bacteriophages, we design a protective carrier bacterium that produces bacteriophages upon sensing X. fastidiosa. Bacteriophages will lyse the bacteria, while simultaneously triggering a plant immune response with specific peptides, forming an alliance between plant and bacteriophage. In order to have the bacteriophage spread to all infected plants, we mimic X. fastidiosa's spread by fusing chitin-binding proteins to the bacteriophage capsid, facilitating their spread by insects. Using our modular approach Xylencer, we believe we can eradicate X. fastidiosa.
https://teams.igem.org/3287	Village	Surface and groundwater quality deterioration is currently considered as one of the most alarming environmental problems, with major impacts on nature and human health. Some contaminants often found in potable water are heavy metals and nitrate, whose detection methods are complex, barely sensitive or cost-prohibitive. To solve these problems, our goal is to develop genetically engineered bacterial biosensors capable of quantifying cadmium, copper, mercury and nitrate concentrations in water samples. In each biosensor, the expression of a different chromoprotein is driven by inducible promoters. Hence, the biosensors achieve different color intensities depending on the pollutant concentration, which have been correlated to contamination levels by means of a mathematical study. In practical terms, our project clear the way for cheap pollutant detection kits development, composed of simplistic bacterial recipients where the water is to be poured and a phone App able to estimate the contaminants concentration from pictures of the recipient.

The effort of reducing plastic in the environment is being made by various fields, however due to the high cost of plastic treatment and its harmful side products a breakthrough is yet to be made. In this project we have established an improved PET degradation system. First, we utilized point mutations with enhanced PET degradation, and implemented a light inducible promoter to regulate the expression of PET-degrading enzymes more effectively. To increase the efficiency of the enzyme expression, we determined the best combination of some constitutive promoters and RBS. Not only that, we used a new signal peptide to increase the amount of secreted enzymes. From these results, we constructed a circulating incubator in which PET is degraded by transgenic E. coli.

The symbiotic plasmid encodes all of the known nodulation (besides NolR) and nitrogen fixation proteins, such as the very important gene nif-specific transcriptional activator (NifA). We cloned the NifA gene from Sinorhizobium fredii, constructed the over-expression vector of pHT43 and transformed into Bacillus subtilis. The NifA over-expressed Bacillus subtilis modulated the soil pH from 4.0 to over 7. It could also provide Nitrogen and improve cotton plant growth. Further research shows that it could maintain the pH about 7 in soil around tea plants and provide Nitrogen for them.
https://teams.igem.org/3294	Foundational Advance	We are developing glutamate and GABA bacterial biosensors by modifying the iGluSnFr and iGABASnFr proteins developed by Marvin et al. (2013, 2019). These proteins consist of a domain that binds the target ligand and an associated fluorescent domain that becomes activated upon binding. The original sensors developed by Marvin et al. also contain sequences to facilitate expression on the surface of mammalian cells. We intend to modify these by replacing the eukaryotic localisation signal and transmembrane anchor with bacterial equivalents. To this end we have selected the truncated from of a bacterial Ice Nucleation Protein that acts as both a membrane anchor and a localisation signal. The motivation for producing these biosensors is to produce a proof of concept system for cheaply measuring serum GABA and Glut concentrations in a clinical context, since the ratio of these two biomarkers is diagnostic of early neurological deterioration following a stroke.

It causes insufficiency of oxygen in the waters, and the release of a poisonous substance called microcystin, which, even in small amount, causes serious diseases like liver cancer. However, the current method of removing microcystin is still inefficient or produces secondary pollution. Here we utilize enzyme MlrA, which is able to degrade microcystin, to solve the pollution. The mlrA genes from several different speices are expressed in E. coli and purified. The results show the microcystin is degraded with mlrA by HPLC (High Performed Liquid Chromatography). Furthermore, we try to design a device which is commercially mass produced and can be utilized by the waterworks or even at home. We anticipate our solution to aid in protecting the environment and avoiding people from getting sick because of drinking contaminated water.
https://teams.igem.org/3297	Environment	Heavy metal contamination at current and former mining sites is a significant environmental and human health problem. Cadmium (Cd) is one of the commonly found metal contaminants, and due to the highly toxic nature, even minute amounts can cause loss of function of the kidney and liver and bone deterioration. We are developing a rapid and efficient cadmium sensing and binding system that is capable of detecting cadmium down to 10 &#956;M concentrations. When exposed to a minimum concentration of Cd, the E.coli cells express the green fluorescent protein (GFP). After Cd is detected, a metallothionein protein binds to it and sequesters it in the periplasmic space of the E. coli cell. We will present data characterizing the performance of this system. The engineered system can be used for remediation efforts to remove Cd from the environment and process it safely.

Life information has been stored in DNA for billions of years, and it can also be used as storing and communicating information. The method of CRISPR Cas12a-Assisted DNA Steganography (CADS) is based on the specific capture of binding primers of Cas12a, which enables the correct information of DNA to be stored in junk and false DNA information, and further enhances the security of key. Here, we encrypt the information storing in DNA combined with computer science, and we further increase the security of DNA information communication based on CADS. Additionally, DNA information is stored in paper. DNA has a very high density of information per unit mass, and as the price drops and the speed of DNA reading and writing speeds up, this method has important application value.

First is to indroduce bacterial Rhodopsin that will pump protons to the site where peripheral HydA resides. Furthermore favorably fluorescent Carbon Quantum Dots can be added to redirect energy of light to rhodopsin thus increasing its pumping rate. Previously introduced SQR also can be used in this case to substitute for inactivated bu sulfide wastewater PSII providing protons and electrons from sulfide. Ultimately all biomass will be converted into graphitic catalytic material that can be use as substitute for platinum catalyst in PEM.

https://teams.igem.org/3301	Village	Antibiotics save lives by killing pathogens, but often kill non-pathogenic gut bacteria as well. These bacteria digest food, help the immune system, synthesize vitamins, and produce neurotransmitters. Antibiotics decrease bacterial diversity by 25%, which can lead to a range of health issues and increase the risk of future infection. Microbiome diversity is regulated and encouraged by Mucus Associated Functional Factors (MAFFs), a protein produced by B. theta bacteria. Antibiotics kill B. theta, thereby reducing MAFF production and creating a cycle that prevents a healthy gut. By introducing the MAFF-producing gene onto a plasmid, inserting this into E. coli, and then transplanting the E. coli into the gut, a microbiome could be regrown. Our bacteria will have a short life expectancy because of our xylose-dependent antitoxin, which inhibits growth once the xylose is metabolized. The MAFFs produced by these regulated E. coli will promote the reestablishment of a healthy microbiome.

https://teams.igem.org/3304	Foundational Advance	We present POSEIDON, a molecular toolkit that harnesses the versatility of nucleic acid networks to investigate intramolecular events that regulate gene expression. With functionality determined entirely by the secondary structure of DNA, strand displacement has emerged as a highly adaptable artificial molecular system with programmable behaviour for cell-free biochemical networks. Through the exploitation of DNA Strand Displacement molecular computation, our toolkit is able to quantify and characterize DNA-Protein interactions. Our team has utilized the principles of DNA circuitry to shed light into the mechanisms of gene activation and transcription factor binding by introducing the protein's target sequence in the processing algorithm. As a proof-of-concept, transcription factors participating in metastatic melanoma are being examined through the lens of molecular programming, to elucidate potential intracellular pathways and therapeutic targets. For the projects outgrowth, we envision an ensemble of advanced modular DNA circuits able to thoroughly investigate complex protein behaviours in malignant pathways.

https://teams.igem.org/3308	Foundational Advance	The design of protein-based cellular circuits offers the potential for rapid information processing. Previously, circuits were designed using kinases and proteases. Here, we propose two methods to design split-intein based cellular circuits. Upon association, split-inteins autosplice the flanking peptide sequences together to form functional proteins. Our first method involves the cascading splicing events through our nested intein design. This involves the insertion of an orthogonal split-intein within an intein half to render it nonfunctional. This creates a multi-input AND gate that can be incorporated into a larger cellular circuit. We propose a second method in which a weakly-associating intein is connected by a flexible linker. This linker is constructed from multi-input AND gates consisting of split-intein pairs, which avoids additional disruption of the extein sequence. We envision using our designed split-intein logic framework to create gene circuits capable of performing various Boolean logic operations through regulated splicing events.
https://teams.igem.org/3309	Environment	Our project aim to create a bacterium able to specifically remove heavy metals from sewage sludges and produce ethanol from the cellulose is contains. To do that, we modified the natural heavy metal resistance mechanisms from the bacterium Cupriavidus metallidurans strain CH34 to enhance or specify its heavy metal removal ability. Then, we provided it enzymes for alcoholic fermentation, to enable it to produce ethanol from glucose resulting from the prior enzymatic digestion of cellulose. The heavy metal resistance modification consists in an OFR deletion lead by homologous recombination. The alcoholic fermentation enzymes consists in a fusion protein created by a previous team placed under the control of the strong and heavy metal inducible "Pan" promoter from Bacillus Subtilis and is provided to our Cupriavidus metallidurans CH34 chassis via a broad range host vector. The final modified strain is tested on sludge samples to demonstrate the application functionality.
https://teams.igem.org/3310	Diagnostics	Despite the billions of dollars spent researching Alzheimers disease (AD), it remains incurable and affects around 35 million people worldwide. Early diagnosis of AD is critical for proper disease management and accelerating AD research. Our team proposes the development of a panel of antibodies to diagnose Alzheimers disease years before its onset by detecting immunologic changes in peripheral blood. We will construct an in vitro model of AD by exposing microglia cells co-cultured with beta amyloid to T-cells. Using a phage display library of random sequences, we will obtain phage binding profiles for these T-cells. This profile will be processed using an algorithm based on amino acid structural similarity clustering to identify antibody sequences that can distinguish between normal T-cells and T-cells exposed to Alzheimers neurons. Deep learning segmentation and antibody epitope prediction will then be used to identify the most probable proteins and pathways that these antibody sequences target.
https://teams.igem.org/3311	High School	Gout, generally induced by monosodium urate crystal deposition, is one of the incurable diseases for human now. The inefficiency faced by gout patients brought by regular blood uric acid test in hospital mainly attributes to the long waiting time for the results. Thus the ultimate goal of our project is to construct a portable, use-friendly blood test device that can be used at home. Briefly, our device was designed based on a uric-acid-responsive regulatory system, named as HucR regulatory system, with mCherry as the reporter protein. Using cellulose acetate membrane as the carrier, the HucR regulatory system was worked as expected. The results shown that the concentration of uric acid is inversely correlated with the intensity of the red fluorescence. We believe this project would open up a new horizons as a pioneer of simple-to-use home diagnostic test kit.

Most riboswitches bind to their corresponding analytes and that invoke a conformational switch that subsequently regulates the expression of the downstream genes. This project explores the design and application of synthetic riboswitch that is capable of detecting environmental contaminants in resource-limited settings. As a proof-of-concept design, we will focus on detecting PCBs, a group of manmade aromatic chemicals that had been widely used in many industrial processes. We will insert a previously discovered PCB aptamer either into the 5-UTR of a bacterial reporter gene or downstream of the start codon. Aptamer binding to PCB will lead to its structural switching that leads to enhancement or reduction of gene expression. Readouts can be a reporter protein or the migration of bacteria to access the efficiency of the proposed system.

These undesirable organic compounds range from endocrine disruptors and pharmaceuticals, to personal care products, pesticides, and fertilizers. The existing wastewater treatment plants lack adequate infrastructure for removing these pollutants. In this project, we employ a synthetic biology approach to develop a self-assembling catalytic bacterial biofilm capable of degrading ECs. The bacteria were engineered to express fusion proteins that assemble into fibrous structures extracellularly and enable greater accessibility of the enzyme substrate. This platform for the degradation of emerging contaminants is a versatile and promising avenue for the removal of these toxic compounds from wastewater.
https://teams.igem.org/3317	Manufacturing	This project aims to implement Bacterial Micrcompartments (BMC) to E. coli as nanoreactors for industrial biotransformation of phenolic compounds present in pre-processed organic waste from lignocellulosic industry called Black Liquor (BL). This will be achieved through encapsulation of a triple enzyme pathway inside of an engineered Propanediol Utilization (PDU) system, a type of BMC from Salmonella. The pathway transforms vanillate, present in BL (initial genetic circuit inductor) in to protocatechuete (secundary inductor), catechol and finally in to cis-cis-Muconate, a chemical used in some polymer production. This strategy will optimize the flux through metabolic channeling, toxic intermediate sequestration and dynamic metabolic control. PDU protein, PduU, was modified through protein engineering to increase flux of substrate into BMC, and Molecular Dynamics Simulations were performed to predict its stability, as well as the permeability of metabolites. Our goal is the design of BMCs as a device to optimize the biosynthesis of compounds.

Recently, it was discovered that the combination of choline and L-carnitine from red meat are converted to trimethylamine (TMA) in the body. TMA is a precursor to trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), which is found to exacerbate cholesterol buildup, ultimately leading to atherosclerosis. In this study, we targeted this pathway by breaking down the precursor, TMA, before TMAO is formed. A system designed to concurrently degrade TMA and subdue its toxic by-product, formaldehyde, was implemented in E. coli for these purposes. This system is composed of Trimethylamine Dehydrogenase (TMADH) and Formaldehyde Dehydrogenase (FDH) which are being tested independently for their degradation properties. Our approach has proven that TMADH is effective in TMA degradation and FDH can be expressed in a bacterial vector to minimize the presence of formaldehyde.

We also built more complex multi-input logic gates using basic logic gates.

A natural sand-fixing system, biological soil crusts, was discovered to fight for desertification. But this natural sand fixation strategy always has little effect when facing the aggressive sand. Thus in our project, an engineered Bacillus subtilis was constructed to effectively produce extracellular polysaccharide, the key component of soil crust via introducing different combinations of key enzymes GalU and PGM. An arabinose-regulated suicide switch was also build to initiate suicide once the engineered bacteria release from the desert environment for biosafety. Furthermore, a symbiotic system of engineered Bacillus subtilis and cyanobacteria was developed to form sand fixers alliance, fighting for desertification.

Briefly, we constructed a lysis-deficient phage mutant (LyDT S1) expressing the antibacterial toxin RelE. The mutant was obtained by replacing the gene of holin, a lysis-promoting phage toxin, with the relE gene, which can still inhibit bacterial growth through the expression of RelE but cannot induce cell lysis because the holin gene is eliminated. This is expected to reduce the amount of endotoxins released from the bacteria, with a corresponding reduction of systemic cytokine response and inflammation during bacterial infection.

https://teams.igem.org/3338	Diagnostics	The placement of implants is one of the most frequently performed operations in hospitals all over the world, still increasing in number. Unfortunately, the risk to develop an implant-associated inflammation after such surgeries is very high. The origin of an implant-associated inflammation is often biofilms, which attach to the implant surface. Targeted treatment of such bacterial biofilms is challenging. A typical therapeutic approach with antibiotics often fails. In the worst case, a generous removal of the region is mandatory. Therefore, it would be helpful to detect the formation of a biofilm at an early stage, increasing the probability of successful treatment. Our project aims to develop a sensor that makes this possible. The sensor is realized by genetically-engineered cells, which can recognize bacterial toxins and produce biomarkers as a response. Throughout the development, we looked at our project from different points of view in conjunction with social and ethical aspects.

These properties lead to a critical challenge in preventing the spread of these diseases. Potentially, routine diagnosis of the entire population can identify all virus carriers to block transmission. However, advanced equipment and skills are required for most diagnostic methods, making it difficult to frequently test all individuals in our society. To address this problem, we propose to develop a diagnostic platform that allows users to perform testing at home on a daily basis. Our approach involves using cellular techniques to generate probes for recognizing viral genomes and using photonics technologies to monitor association between our probes and viral DNA. We anticipate that a test will only take a short period of time and it can be easily performed by all users.

When food waste enters landfills, there are a variety of environmental consequences. This is due to the copious amounts of greenhouse gases emitted during the production of our food. Additionally, food shipping utilizes cardboard and plastic for shipping, which harms our environment significantly. Although food waste disposal services are available, they release methane and are not economically productive. Furthermore, composting facilities do assist in combating the issue of food waste but are oftentimes not readily available or advertised. While some do have access to home composting, this is an inefficient method of reducing food waste and may attract pests.

We engineered an E. coli strain harboring a gene circuit to sense the dinitrotoluene (DNT), a typical chemical released by landmines. DNT can trigger the bioluminescence generation module in our engineered bacteria, and emitted optical signal can be captured and converted to digital output by the device, which is uploaded to an on-site computer. Through data processing, we will be able to create a probabilistic heat map of the landmines in a particular area. Eventually, an optimized landmine clearance route can be proposed to assist manual landmine detection with a minimal risk of deminers injury.

This project aims to design a living sea defense system (bio-concrete tetrapods) by incorporating organisms capable of carrying out plastics and bio-cementation bioremediation. Several plasmids will be design to breakdown the plastic and carry out the bio-cementation process, and some plasmids will have the genes under a constitutive promoter; others would have it under a pH-responsive promoter to maintain the optimal pH for the ecosystem while others would be under a light-inducible promoter, which will be activated in the presence of increased light due to occurring cracks in the tetrapod. We are aiming to identify the conditions necessary to initiate the ecosystem and for making it self-balancing.
https://teams.igem.org/3369	Environment	The formation of the complex bacterial community, termed as biofilm, has proved to be critical events in both industry and medical fields. P.aeruginosa, as a common opportunity pathogen, could form resistant bioflim on pipelines which allows it to evade antibiotics and disinfectants. The diatomic gas nitric oxide(NO), a significant signal molecular in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes, has been demonstrated to regulate the formation of the biofilm in P.aeruginosa. Here we designed the engineered bacteria, E.coli in this project, which coudld sense the presence of P.aeruginosa via introduced Rhl quorum sensing(QS) system, triggering the synthesis of NOS gene and the production of NO, and eventually resulting in the biofilm dispersion. Compared with NO gas and chemical donors, our engineered bacteria provides another solution to degrade the biofilm with better efficiency and cost.
https://teams.igem.org/3370	Foundational Advance	Large scale biosynthesis in producing valuable molecules and proteins come into its embryonic stage for more sustainable and renewable ways of manufacturing and simultaneously faces multiple challenges in bioengineering. Incorporation of light-driven proton pump into non-phototrophic bacteria to produce additional proton motive force has gained interest in recent years as several bacterial rhodopsins are utilized for generating larger amounts of adenosine-5-triphosphate(ATP) for alleviating the metabolic stress caused by excessive reliance on glucose and supporting bioengineering reactions. We expressed functional Gloeobacter rhodopsin from ancient bacteria, Gloeobacter violaceus, on E. coli Lemo-21 and evaluated its growth and metabolic reactions and found it potent in creating alternative proton motive force for oxidative phosphorylation and eventually proved it to be ideal for improving protein and molecule yields. Gloeobacter rhodopsin-based E. coli serves as a fundamental strain that uses light as energy sources, thus paving promising avenues for biosynthesis and creative daily usages.
https://teams.igem.org/3371	Environment	Traditional calcium carbonate production methods emit large amounts of carbon dioxide as well as many toxic compounds due to the reliance on fossil fuels in the manufacturing process. Our team is developing a novel precipitation method using bacteria engineered with enzymes capable of producing the carbonate ions required for precipitation of calcium carbonate. One enzyme we are focusing on is carbonic anhydrase (CA), an enzyme that facilitates the interconversion of carbon dioxide and bicarbonate in solution. CA should not only increase carbonate production, but also allow for atmospheric carbon dioxide to be used as the feedstock for the carbonate ions. Our method has the potential capability to be employed with a 3D-bioprinter that will print structures comprising a hydrogel and our engineered bacteria. On precipitation the calcium carbonate should take the shape of the hydrogel structure. One potential application, is the production of coral backbones used to facilitate coral regrowth.

However, the water is polluted: pesticides, hormones and antibiotics are present and might have a negative effect on the environment and human health. Our goal is to develop a solution to purify water. Using Chlamydomonas reinhardtii as a chassis, we designed a microalgae filter capable of retaining and degrading these harmful compounds. We focused our efforts on Atrazine, a banned herbicide but still detectable in the Seine. We expressed four enzymes from the bacteria genera Pseudomonas in C. reinhardtii using the Golden Gate Modular Cloning (MoClo). This newly added degradation pathway aims at degrading Atrazine into a less hazardous product. To ensure additional safety, we integrated a "kill switch" device based on UV-sensitive nuclease genetic circuit leading to the death of microalgae which could escape in the wild.

Nowadays, probiotic treatment is attractive but with limited effectiveness. As a result, we designed a probiotic that can eliminate Streptococcus mutans, the main cause of dental caries. We genetically modified a E. coli probiotic strain, Nissle (EcN) with pyruvate oxidase (SpxB) gene to generate H2O2, aquaporin (AQP) gene to facilitate H2O2 transport, and catalase (KatG) gene to revive from oxidative stress by decomposing H2O2 into oxygen and water. We successfully presented a proof of concept in H2O2 assay, growth inhibition and antagonistic test against the growth of S. mutans. Furthermore, we developed a prototype, Cleandy, a candy can clean your teeth. The Cleandy composed of sugar alcohols and our engineered probiotic (GM EcN) was demonstrated in our experiment showing effective antagonistic activity against S. mutans by producing H2O2.

Nevertheless, it suffers from damages in our daily life due to many reasons such as physical knock, acid erosion and bacterial infection. In the early stage of enamel damage, it is usually difficult to notice changes on the teeth or in the oral environment. However, in the later stage, when a tooth is decayed or ruptured, even doctors are unable to completely repair the damaged tooth. Besides, the treatment is painful and expensive. Our Tooth Fairy project could be an innovative solution to this problem. A tooth fairy contains several genetic circuits that enable her to provide automatic and personalized repair for the damaged tooth enamel. In addition, users can also know their oral status owing to the report ability of a tooth fairy.

These substances still cannot be filtered out of the wastewater completely. The laccases, a class of enzymes able to degrade numerous pollutants, are immobilized to a mesoporous silica foam, making them long-term sustainable and more pH- and thermostable. Silica-based materials are well suited because they are environmentally friendly, biocompatible and resistant to organic solvents and microbial attacks. Because the enzymes are bound to a matrix via our innovative poly-lysine tag, no genetically modified organisms are released into the environment. Furthermore, the degradation products have no negative effects on nature anymore. We were able to express the laccase of S. cyaneus and to synthesize the silica foam. Furthermore, we were able to predict the substrate conversion rate in regard to the amount of immobilized laccases via a kinetic model according to Michaelis-Menten.

That's why we developed Finding NEMO, a transcription only and cell-free system for biosensing. By stripping back the material necessities, we made biosensing faster, cheaper, safer and more accessible. To achieve this we have utilised fluorescent RNA aptamers to replace the conventional GFP protein reporters. We then devised an isothermal amplification and rudimentary logic processing system mediated by synthetic RNA transcription bubbles and T7-RNA-Polymerase. To this base system, we have studied the integration of conventional biosensing modalities such as transcription factors, transcriptional riboswitches and direct oligonucleotide sensing. Our case study application is environmental water testing and we have spoken to industry leaders and regulatory authorities. At every stage we have championed open science and the UNs sustainable development goals to ensure our design is beneficial to all and the environment.

Therefore, we aim at reducing the harm of PET to the environment by using cutinases with a lower cost safely. First, we will determine the optimum working conditions of cutinases. Different kind of cutinases will be compared on their ability, efficiency, and optimum condition of degradation. Furthermore, those cutinases will be chosen and we will focus on the degradation rate of PET. We will consider not only the efficiency but the safety of using cutinases to degrade PET.

Pheromone-mediated mating in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae provides a genetically accessible model system to investigate cell-cell fusion. However, the high price of pheromone limits the development of related research. In our project, we constructed mutants to reshape signaling pathway, trying to build a chassis that responds to cheaper inducers. We characterized the intensity of three mostly pheromone responsive promoters, pfus2, pprm1, and pfig1. We innovatively evaluated the efficiency of these promoters (natural and synthetic) with pheromone responsive elements (PRE) of various copy numbers and directions. Our results expand the promoter toolbox to finely tune gene expression levels for efficient cell factories and biosensors.

We aim to improve the production efficiency of Aspergillus niger by creating a synthetic biology toolbox that focuses on mycelial morphology and secretion. Morphology has a significant effect on productivity of certain compounds, while proper secretion is important for later recovery and purification of a compound. We have approached our goal in three ways: 1) Characterising morphological changes of A. niger by engineering seven morphology related genes. 2) Establishing a computational model of mycelium growth based on imaging data. 3) Developing a library of native and synthetic signal peptides for protein secretion. By improving the efficiency of bio-based production processes, we can improve the economic incentive to use them, and decrease our heavy reliance on oil-based substrates in the chemical industry.

They can be harmful for the environment and human health because they are persistent and can remain biologically active. Additionally, they may promote the development of antimicrobial resistance. According to various experts, there will likely be regulations regarding the monitoring of macrolide antibiotics in the near future. However, current methods for measuring them are time-consuming, expensive and require expertise. Our solution, SINISENS, is designed to aid wastewater treatment plants to monitor the concentrations of macrolide antibiotics and could be used to optimize the removal process. SINISENS is an optical on-site biosensor based on a genetic circuit that utilises a transcription factor called MphR to detect macrolide antibiotics. In the presence of these compounds, SINISENS produces green fluorescence as an output signal.

We believe that the best way to raise safety and confidence in synthetic biology products is by adding genetic biocontainment systems, which are genes and genome edits that give us control over the life of our microbes. These systems range from small genetic circuits of promoters and toxins to complete genomic rewrites, and weve compiled all of them into a simple, flexible database.

https://teams.igem.org/3413	Foundational Advance	A key challenge in the field of synthetic biology is genomic instability of introduced genes. Once a gene is inserted into a host organism, it can cause an additional metabolic load, significantly reducing host fitness. Mutations that damage the introduced gene are therefore likely to be selected for, diminishing its expression. These mutations could render synthetic-biology products obsolete and require constant maintenance. We propose interlocking a target gene to the N-terminus of an essential gene in the hosts genome, under the same promoter. This way, mutations on the target gene are likely to affect the expression of the essential gene, leading to mutated host mortality. We are developing a software called sTAUbility, that would match the best-fitting essential gene and linker to a given target gene, based on bioinformatic models and novel approaches for measuring stability. Furthermore, sTAUbility optimizes the combined construct for efficient gene expression and increased stability.

However, the current screening methods such as contactless thermometers and infrared cameras are not efficient because of the high costs of resources needed for setting up screening booths and its failure to monitor temperature continuously. Our Thermopatch is a device that complements these limitations. In the process, we utilized light-up RNA aptamer(Catalytic Hairpin Assembly(CHA) method specifically) and thermosensing RNA. We ultimately hope our Thermopatch can help people get through these difficult times.

https://teams.igem.org/3424	Environment	Team Florida 2020 takes inspiration from their 2019 project to improve and apply the novel biosensor technology that detects and records phosphorous levels to real-world ecological implications. This project couples the Synthetic Cellular Recorders Integrating Biological Events (SCRIBE) system with the naturally occurring PhoB-PhoR system in E.coli. In response to phosphorus, SCRIBE utilizes a reverse transcriptase enzyme to produce single stranded DNA which can be incorporated into the host-genome during DNA replication using the Beta Recombinase protein which results in a mutation within the bacterial chromosome. This system can be utilized to measure the amount of phosphorus in a body of water by modeling the fraction of cells that gain the mutation per generation. In the absence of a lab, the UF iGEM team seeks to model this hypothetical biosensor as part one of a two-part project.

https://teams.igem.org/3426	Environment	Plastic bed mulch films are an essential agricultural tool; they limit fumigant emissions, provide UV and water resistance, prevent weed and pest growth, and maximize crop yield. However, current disposal methods are unsustainable; the majority of bed mulches are dumped into landfills, degrade into harmful chemicals, and pollute local communities. Komaplastics will lay the foundation for creation of a biodegradable bed mulch from bacterial cellulose (BC) produced by Komagataeibacter rhaeticus. BC is highly crystalline due to hydrogen bonding between hydroxyl groups of adjacent strands which is a barrier to homogenous incorporation of plasticizing molecules. Thus, we investigated carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) for their potential to disrupt these hydrogen bonding networks and facilitate addition of plasticizing molecules. We also tested various compounds for their ability to plasticize chemically decrystallized BC. Our work will provide a scaffold for the development of a cellulose-based biodegradable plastic bed mulch film produced in a biological system.
https://teams.igem.org/3427	Information Processing	HuGenesS is based on the concept of overlapping genes, where a DNA stretch encodes two genes, depending on the reading frame. The genes are interlaced, as if in a loving hug! While such genetic arrangements exist in nature, this phenomenon could not be easily harnessed for synthetic biology until the CAMEOS software was developed by Harris Wangs Team. We used it to generate several entangled genes encoding reporter and antibiotic resistance proteins. We cloned the sequence encoding GFP and KNT. Since the cloned entangled genes lost functionality, we improved CAMEOS to generate sequences preserving conserved amino acids and to choose the best overlap. We have written comprehensive tutorials on utilizing CAMEOS. The improved software generated sequences that are currently tested by a research team optimizing lipid synthesis in yeast. Genetic entanglement has many potential applications from designing minimal genomes to developing improved, safer and more stable genetic constructs. Confined hugs!

With widespread adoption, they could also increase the incidence of gene flowthe transfer of genetic variation across populationsfrom transgenic to wild crops, threatening biodiversity. Hence, a solution is proposed wherein an optogenetic killswitch, introduced in Nicotiana benthamiana, preventing plant development upon exposure to UV-B light (~311 nm). Through the optogenetic pair comprised of ULTRAVIOLET RESPONSE LOCUS 8 (UVR8) with attached tetracycline repressor domain (TetR) and CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1 (COP1) with attached VP16 transactivation domain, the transcription of synthetic trans-acting small interfering RNAs (syn-tasiRNAs) will be controlled. These syn-tasiRNAs will disrupt the CLAVATA-WUSCHEL signaling pathway through the knockdown of the WUSCHEL (WUS) gene. Stem cells in the shoot apical meristem (SAM) will differentiate, causing stem cell depletion and prevention of further plant growth.

However, this method frequently results in false-negative outcomes. We aim to develop a simple and systematic approach to assist doctors in diagnosing and treating oral cancers in the early stage, ultimately decreasing the mortality rate of the disease. We chose the miRNAs present in the patient's saliva as our biomarker. When they bind to our designed toehold switches, the loop on the toehold unwinds and translates the enzyme, invertase, which can break down sucrose into glucose. The amount of glucose can be measured by a glucometer, and doctors can use the measured data to assist diagnosis of oral cancer. Our project not only helps doctors with the diagnosis but also increases patients' survival rate and their life quality.

Most importantly, Optizyme allows for optimization of enzyme concentrations within cell-free systems through a gradient descent algorithm that accepts models built using Optizymes capabilities, as well as any user constructed model that fulfills certain requirements detailed in the package documentation. Accuracy of the optimization algorithm is tested on the model described in A combined experimental and modelling approach for the Weimberg pathway optimisation (Shen et al).

A challenge is that it is more beneficial for cells to use their resources exclusively for growth, resulting in a loss of production ability. Therefore, we have developed Forbidden FRUITS, a pipeline that can solve this problem by calculating and optimizing engineering strategies to couple a product forming pathway to microbial growth. Multiple databases, constraint-based programming and gene-protein-reaction associations are used to devise suitable strategies. These strategies are then optimized using pathfinding methods and sequence optimization. As proof-of-principle, we applied Forbidden FRUITS to salicylic acid, lactate and mannitol production in Synechocystis PCC6803, lactate in Synechococcus UTEX 2973 and salicylic acid in Escherichia Coli. Forbidden FRUITS is shown to be flexible and allow for the fast development of stable production strains, making the full-potential of biotechnology evermore attainable.

Current on-site kits have false-negative rates as high as 33%. In an effort to provide accurate, non-invasive, affordable, and rapid Point of Care(POC) diagnostic tests for COVID-19 and other emerging pandemics, Purdue iGEM is developing cArgo: a COVID-19 Argonaute mediated microfluidic diagnostic device. cArgo extracts viral RNA from saliva for amplification and conversion into dsDNA. TtAgo that we will express and purify from e.coli then cleaves the dsDNA using COVID-19 DNA guides producing ssDNA fragments. These fragments hybridize to molecular beacons emitting a quantifiable fluorescent signal for conclusive result determination. Coupling the biologics with chip barcoding and app integration, we hope to revolutionize POC Diagnostics while making data more accessible for simultaneous detection and contact tracing.
https://teams.igem.org/3440	Environment	After centuries spent using oceans for waste management, weve finally realized impact of water pollution. Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs), including PFOS (perfluorooctanesulfonic acid) and PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls), have been of great concern, due to their toxicity in low concentrations and bioaccumulating properties that lead to alarming concentrations in the ecosystem. Current detection methods, which are performed by analyzing massive amounts of water samples in the lab, cannot properly measure the low levels of POPs nor differentiate between the various iterations that exist. Our project S-POP aims to solve this issue by creating a monitor containing two major parts, a modular E. coli biosensor coupled with a Microbial Fuel Cell. When E. coli is activated by the pollutant a Quorum sensing (QS) molecule is produced. Upregulated by the QS-molecule, engineered Shewanella oneidensis produces an oscillating electrical signal that corresponds to the type and quantity of pollutants in the sample.

Previously, it has been shown that these larvae can use polystyrene foam as sole carbon source, thus it is a biodegradable substance. We designed a recombinant Escherichia coli strain capable of converting acetyl-CoA to acetone. The genetic modifications intend to integrate a plasmid carrying several genes of the ABE fermentation. We want to have acetone produced by bacteria in the intestines of the larvae. Here, it is supposed to help breaking down the plastic, because acetone can dissolve polystyrene. Acetone intercalates in between the polymer chains and increases the surface area that can be attacked by the bacteria.

https://teams.igem.org/3445	Environment	The Pine River is found in central Michigan, near the campus of Alma College. Following the closure of the Velsicol Chemical Plant in 1978, many environmental pollutants -- such as DDT -- were improperly disposed of and allowed to leach into the surrounding soil and Pine River. These organochlorides are endocrine disruptors as well as possible carcinogens that have wreaked havoc on the local avian population. Several species of animals have estrogen receptors known to bind DDT, a known xenoestrogen. Linking this binding process to a reporting gene, such as RFP, within a microbe will allow for the detection of organochlorides, which can enhance broad spectrum screening of these contaminated areas both locally and globally. Ultimately, this biosensor has the potential to save thousands of dollars in the pollution cleanup effort as well as provide a basis for the development of future synthetic biology tools for the bioremediation of DDT.
https://teams.igem.org/3446	Environment	All plants need nitrogen to survive, but cannot use nitrogen (N2) directly from the atmosphere. They must receive their nitrogen as ammonia (NH3) that has been fixated by other sources such as symbiotic bacteria, decomposing plants, or synthetic fertilizers. Today, the world population is only sustainable if ammonia-rich fertilizers are used to increase crop production. However, fertilizer is an environmental hazard due to the extensive release of carbon dioxide. Also, fertilizer runoff causes algae populations to grow faster than the ecosystem can handle, creating oxygen-depleted dead zones within the ocean. Due to growing environmental concerns, genetically engineering plants to contain the bacterial enzyme, nitrogenase, may allow plants to become self-fertilizing. Nitrogenase is extremely sensitive to radical oxygen and may not survive in plant cells. Our team has proposed a protein engineering solution by coupling an enzyme that scavenges radical oxygen (superoxide dismutase) directly to nitrogenase; allowing for self-fertilization.

In order to solve this problem, ShanghaiTech_China designed a new detection system -- CESAR (Cas12a-based Efficient Solution to Antibiotic-Resistance), to identify antibiotic-residue and ARGs. CESAR contains two devices with different purposes: (1) CESAR-I is a portable rapid-response device for on-site antibiotic-residue detection. By integrating the aptamer-sensing module, Cas12a-reporting module, and fluorescence-measuring module, it simplifies the process and lowers the cost of antibiotic-abuse surveillance. (2) CESAR-II is designed for doctors' detecting ARGs. Current techniques are either time-consuming or too expensive for hospitals in less-developed regions. CESAR-II is cost-effective and can help eliminate the medical disparity caused by unbalanced economic development.

The powder can be stored at room temperature for a long time, without any usage of professional equipment.

Coli, our team attempted to create an enzymatic system capable of degrading the elastane fibre through biological means, effectively providing a biological solution to an environmental problem. A large part of our project has also been to communicate this large waste impact of the fashion industry, and to show that we really have No Time to Waste.
https://teams.igem.org/3478	WIKI	The aim of our project is to address PET plastic recycling coverage flaws as well as improving the tourists experiences through fragrance in natural tourist areas. It will incorporate elements that will educate the public about the importance of plastic degradation and environmental protection. The accomplishment of the our iGEM project this year has two main sectors-- the experiments, which includes the fragrance and plastic degradation, and the hardware. The first experiment was used to insert leaf compost cutinase genes into the E. coli and optimize conditions for translation of the LCC enzyme as well as the conditions for degradation of the PET plastic. Another experiment was inserting the geraniol synthase and linalool synthase gene to produce the linalool fragrance. The mechanical trash can that we designed will assemble these synthetic biology part to degrade plastic. It is comprised of three parts the shredder, the power source, and the decomposer.

https://teams.igem.org/3480	New Application	SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible and pathogenic. In addition to the nature of RNA virus with high mutation rate, antigenic drift is the main evolutionary mechanism for SARS-CoV-2. Its wide-spreading has currently resulted in the evolutionary variants different from the originate isolate. Therefore, to curb this pandemic, effective surveillance of circulating viruses is much more urgent. We developed a high throughput POCT platform for the SARS-CoV-2 detection with the help of DMF. A nanomachine called DNA Walker can amplify the region-specific sequence of the virus genome in the specimen. And then it will be read out by E-CRISPR, which can output an electric signal by a Cas9 nickase and corresponding electrode. We are targeting not only the detection of COVID-19 viruses with alarming dangerous mutations, but also differentiating other related viruses and pathogens. This is not only for managing todays pandemic, but also for the potential outbreaks of other coronaviruses.

Recovery still relies heavily on standard chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery. A promising new approach in cancer treatment is chronotherapy. By administering drugs according the circadian rhythm, chronotherapy aims at maximizing efficacy and minimizing side effects. For our project, we introduced a synthetic circuit producing oscillations into E. coli Nissle 1917, a tumour-targeting probiotic strain of E. coli, to explore the potential benefits of chronotherapy. The final engineered strain delivers azurin, an anti-cancer peptide in an periodic manner. In the interest of biosafety, we also built a kill-switch to be incorporated into the final design.

However, Some biology researchers are faced with complicated metabolic pathways just like sailors trapped in the ocean, and our teams integrated platform, "Synthesis navigator, can assist them in the design of metabolic pathways. The first part of our project is an integrated database named Synthetic Bay , which contains much more data than last year, for synthetic biology sailors to get supplied. Secondly, in order to construct a route in metabolism oceans, synthetic biology sailors can input the starting and target compound (or one of them) then Synthesis navigator can search out a number of possible metabolic pathways from the database. Last, what counts is that facing unknown ocean environment, sailors can utilize the Hybrid Metabolic Simulation to predict the metabolic situation of chassis organisms thus avoiding the frustrated adventure in metabolic ocean.
https://teams.igem.org/3484	Therapeutics	One-third of the treated hypothyroidism patients do not respond correctly to current therapies. To solve that, a system capable of restoring hormonal feedback was designed, offering an alternative to the 10% of Spaniards and 5% of the global population that suffer from this endocrine disorder. Its functioning is based on our successfully engineered intein-mediated Escherichia coli biosensor, which showed a great response to distinct T3 thyroid hormone levels giving rise to different superfolder GFP concentrations. This was designed to be coupled to a PID controller, which computes the dosage that compensates for hormonal disbalances. As a proof of concept for the validation of this regulatory mechanism, a lactone cell circuit incorporating a turbidostat was developed, showing a high correlation between the experimental and modelling results. Finally, a detailed future implementation plan was defined so that it included the necessary steps towards a feasible implementation of this innovative treatment.

Our Team NTHU_Taiwan design a concept for biosynthesis of quantum dots utilizing industrial heavy metal containing wastewater. Hereby we hypothesized to gain multiple benefits from single project. We first aimed of bio-synthesizing quantum dots using E-coli. Secondly, we planned to use cadmium rich industrial wastewater as a source of metal ions. Under normal conditions bacteria itself cannot manage efficient internalization of metals which might leads to cellular oxidative stress and bacterial death. So, we used gene editing techniques and promoter genes to control internalization of cadmium ion and production of cadmium sulfide quantum dots. We are successful on genetically modifying E coli, to seek highly efficient productivity of QDs.

A leading cause of irreversible blindness, glaucoma affects millions of people worldwide and causes heavy burden on healthcare systems. The only proven effective treatment is reducing the patients intraocular pressure (IOP), which is usually done by providing eyedrops with IOP-lowering effect, like nitric oxide. However, due to ineffective IOP management and warning strategies, blindness is still a problem. Therefore, iGEM NCKU-Tainan developed a revolutionary solution, Eye kNOw, a pair of contact lenses that contains engineered bacteria producing nitric oxide in response to IOP fluctuation. We also developed Eye Screen, an affordable and portable detection device that utilizes ultrasound to measure IOP and identify the high-risk groups. With Eye kNOw and Eye Screen, IOP can be controlled in a real-time manner, and glaucoma can be detected and monitored with a low-cost device, saving more people from life-long darkness.

To ensure safety, we introduce a light controlled kill-switch, supernova gene: when bacteria release into the bright environment from the dark chamber of MFCs, light will activate the gene which produces superoxide radical anions to kill the cells. Meanwhile, we intend to modify the hardware of MFCs: infuse certain concentration of heavy metal ions into the anode to facilitate the electricity generation, and use graphite combined with Mn2+/Fe2+ as the cathode so that the cathode can create Fenton reagent to degrade some recalcitrant chemicals.

We engaged in conversations with experts to identify potential solutions to these problems, ultimately targeting ropy maple syrup. Ropy syrup has a very high viscosity, is not marketable, and damages maple syrup production equipment, which results in important economic losses, particularly for smaller producers. It is caused by the presence of dextrans produced by specific types of bacteria in the sap. aSAP, by team iGEM ULaval 2020-2021, will aim to develop an enzymatic treatment to degrade dextran and turn ropy maple syrup into a marketable product. Since maple syrup is stored at room temperatures, we are planning to use a dextranase from a psychrophile (cold-adapted) bacteria. In 2020, we have validated our candidate enzyme in silico, planned experiments to characterize and optimize it, and designed our implementation proposal.

One of the strategies to combat fires involves the use of firefighting foams, but these usually contain fluorosurfactants (PFAS), which pose an environmental threat. Therefore, our goal is to produce an eco-friendly alternative to this type of threatening substances. To do so, we plan to employ synbio tools to produce four of the Ranaspumin proteins present in the bubble nests of Leptodactilidae frogs, and regulating B. subtilis natural complex metabolic pathway in charge of synthesizing its biofilms matrix components for us to substitute PFAS as foaming agents in firefighting mixtures. Not only will our project aid the environment, but it will also allow underfunded fire departments to access these tools because, as there are no foam producers in this country, current foams are very expensive due to importation costs.

Genetically modifying corals symbiotic microalgae, Symbiodinium, to better withstand heat stress may combat coral bleaching. We have attempted several transformations, creatively designed an algae house, and built a temperature-ecological amplitude model based on the Shelford's Law of Tolerance to find the best conditions for culturing Symbiodinium. In addition, we have successfully designed a recombinant plasmid by inserting a GUS reporter gene and the most appropriate modified heat resistant gene, heat shock factor, into a dinoflagellate-optimized expression DinoIII plasmid. We will perform a biolistics gene gun-mediated transformation. Because the commercial gene gun is so expensive, we will use 2018 iGEM team Worcesters design to build our own gene gun. Hopefully, the corals will uptake the modified algae, increasing their resistance to bleaching.

https://teams.igem.org/3502	Foundational Advance	RNA binding proteins(RBPs) play an essential role in tumors and neurodegenerative diseases, while most of them lack of effective inhibitors. Since directed evolution has shown its high efficiency, this year we provided a sample combining rational design and directed evolution to obtain dsRNA inhibitors of RBPs and took ADAR1, a dsRNA adenosine deaminase, as an example. In our project, an algorithm-guided model was trained from natural substrates of ADAR1 and used to established a candidate dsRNA library. Those candidates were connected to a self-splicing stem-loop sequence and transferred into HeLa cells with toxic genes regulated by ADAR1 and Tet-on system, which only survived when endogenous ADAR1 was inhibited by transferred dsRNAs. Efficient substrates were extracted and used to train the model above for the next round. Through the continuous cycle of this screening process, we could obtain high-efficiency inhibitors of ADAR1 efficiently, and extend this model to other RBPs.
https://teams.igem.org/3503	Village	Current flame retardant materials are known to be hazardous to human body and our environment. To solve this problem, we here developed Eco-friendly and harmless flame retardant E. coli. While previous iGEM teams and research groups attempted to produce flame retardant proteins, the proteins they produced cannot retain on the surfaces of objects and can be washed away easily, precluding the application of these proteins. To address the problem, we engineered E. coli to produce flame retardant proteins (SR or casein) fused with surface adhering proteins (cellulose binding domain or mussel adhesive proteins). Thereby, we improved previous iGEM flame retardant systems, which contain only flame retardant proteins. We here proved the protein expression, fire retardancy and sustainability of our flame retardant systems, matching our previous modelling results. Additionally, we also engineered an easy-to-make vertical burning test, helping us and future iGEM teams to test flame retardants.

It is characterized by a generally poor prognosis and strong resistance to traditional therapies. This season, we focused on designing a novel immunotherapeutic approach involving DNA-launched RNA Replicons (DREP). We utilized our hotspot detection tool, Custommune, to generate a list of candidate neo-epitopes from clinically prioritized neoantigens thus reducing the need for extensive sequencing approaches. After in silico validation of our generated neo-epitope predictions, we devised a DREP-based platform to effectively deliver our multi-neo-epitope vaccine. The platform utilizes the inherent self-amplification ability of RNA-replicons to ensure enhanced neo-antigen uptake and presentation leading to the mounting of efficient cellular and humoral immune responses against TNBC. Embedded with optimized subgenomic regulation and linker-peptides alongside glycine-alanine repeats (GAr), a miRNA-based immune evasion mechanism and an OFF-switch, our platform is predicted to be highly safe and efficient through experimentally-driven mathematical simulations.

In recent years, the method combing CRISPR/Cas9 and barcode, a DNA sequence as genetic marker, has attracted extensive attention in lineage tracing. However, the diversity of barcodes is limited and the constitutively expressed Cas9 consumes barcodes quickly. These make barcodes infeasible for the tracking purpose after several generations. We propose to track more generations by two ways. First, we build an inducible expression module of Cas9 in association with cell division to label each cell automatically without wasting barcodes. Second, we use homing guide RNA (hgRNA) to replace the small guide RNA (sgRNA) so that the diversity of barcodes can be increased greatly. In order to make the barcode sequence read at RNA level, we design a double promoter module, so that we can obtain the lineage information together with transcriptomic information.

In fact, it was found that due to climate change, and thus, rising groundwater temperatures in Germany, manganese (Mn2+) concentrations in local water resources increase. Accordingly, we propose an approach for the measurement and retention of Mn2+-ions in which we use genetically engineered E. coli as a bifunctional biosensor. Our system contains a riboswitch, which triggers a fluorescent signal in the presence of Mn2+-Ions, in combination with induced complexion for clearance of Mn2+-Ions with phytochelatin proteins. Due to its sequence complexity, we modified the phytochelatin sequence in silico, and modeled the variants structures to subsequently evaluate their stability using Molecular Dynamics simulation. Upon successful cloning, the functionality and detection range of our system is assessed using titrated Mn2+, prior to investigating the signal kinetics and effects of cell density, as well as heavy metal retention in vivo.
https://teams.igem.org/3511	Village	The extensive use of plastics in recent decades has led to an increasing amount of plastic wastes which consist of non-biodegradable and non-incinerable plastics such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polyurethane (PUR). These wastes are discarded into the environment causing serious environmental pollution problems. This has inspired our team to search for effective scientific options to help reduce plastic pollution. In this project, we have adopted an in-silico mutagenesis approach to design two PUR-degrading enzymes - papain and polyurethanase esterase A (PueA) - that could be used to enhance PET and PUR biodegradation. Ultimately, we are aiming to construct a multi plastic-degrading E. coli bug by combining the genes of the two mutant enzymes (papain and PueA) with the well-studied polyethylene terephthalate hydrolase (PETase) gene in a single biobrick. It is hoped that this technology will contribute to reducing plastic wastes and help better protect our environment.

Post harvest, invertase cleaves sucrose which reduces sugar retrieval rates by up to 10.25%. We wanted to devise a solution that initiated grassroots-level changes for farmers. The farmer would administer our novel polymer-based inoculant, which would release our bacteria into the stem of the sugarcane, by employing an injector mechanism. Once inside, our genetic circuit inside the bacterial E.coli chassis is designed to exhibit anti-invertase activity, regulated by the amount of fructose inside the sugarcane in a continuous and controlled manner, through a biosensor mechanism. We propose to use a modified type II ccdA-ccdB toxin-antitoxin system as our kill switch that is activated upon exposure to atmospheric concentrations of oxygen.

Some of those cellulose materials can only be buried or burnt, which creates pollution for the environment. To deal with those materials, we come up with an idea of using genetically engineered E.colis to transform cellulose into glucose with the help of enzymes, including endoglucanases(cex), exoglucanases(cen), and &#946;-glucosidases, and the E.colis generate electricity in Microbial Fuel Cells.

Firstly, we designed our experiments in silico to contribute our parts to the iGEM registry. We then cloned the plasmids containing the recombination system necessary for engineering our phage. The genes to be inserted into the phage genome were amplified. Additionally, we designed a safety measure to inhibit the engineered phages ability to reproduce autonomously. To support our experimental findings we modelled the interaction between T7 bacteriophages and E.coli. Furthermore, to gain more insight into the biology of the T7 bacteriophage, we collaborated with team TU Delft to characterize the wildtype.

The designed probiotic secretes polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), which may lyse viral envelopes and suppress replication by positive strand RNA viruses, in addition to regulating inflammation. Our smart probiotic is designed to sense excessive inflammation by detecting high levels of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma, and to respond by switching PUFA production from arachidonic acid to anti-inflammatory docosahexaenoic acid. To determine our probiotics feasibility, our mathematical model quantifies the amount of PUFA produced by the probiotic, and how secreted PUFA affects viral load and cytokine production. This complex model extends beyond current probiotic models by accounting for spatial heterogeneity and transcriptional stochasticity. With our novel design and rigorous modeling, TheraPUFA provides a framework for implementing smart, living antiviral therapies.

Furthermore, all the atrazine detection equipment in the market today have major flaws - expensiveness, heaviness, and difficulties in application. Thus, atrazine will leak into farms, lakes, and ocean without an effective and economical solution.

As a result, combing with a fluorescent protein, the gene will show its reaction when encountering certain concentration of phosphorus. Using this strategy we will be able to conduct pre-test of water pollution before investing much money and energy on processing unpolluted water. And through editing the gene, we will be able to detect water sources' phosphorus concentration that will harm human health by an easy and inexpensive method. We expect our experiment to become the starting point of detecting water pollution through biological method.

In this hybrid catalysis system, bacteria can use CO2 and H2 as substrates to produce lycopene. As a result, CO2 can be transformed to valuable chemicals with electricity input and renewable electrical energy derived from wind and solar energy can be stored as chemical energy simultaneously.

https://teams.igem.org/3544	New Application	Late spring cold (LSC) is a common climatic phenomenon in many areas of the world, which refers to the sudden appearance of continuous low temperature after the weather warms up in middle of spring. Every year, LSC causes huge agricultural and economic losses through freezing the bud of crops. Currently, spraying abscisic acid (ABA) is the main way to deal with LSC. However, chemically synthesized ABA usually contains by-products and toxic waste, while purified ABA is expensive. Therefore, we hope to give a new application to Saccharomyces cerevisiae, so that it can synthesize ABA before the onset of LSC, and develop a software to predict degree of LSC. In addition, in order to solve the deficiency of eukaryotes' monocistronic gene expression system in the field of exogenous product biosynthesis, we develop a new application of the CRISPR-Csy4 system in the construction of eukaryotic multicistronic exogenous gene expression system.

Marxianus & Pichia Pastoris) and the control elements that link them. The biosensor based self-regulation is realized by sensing the changes in the concentration of various intermediates during fermentation. Through the above design, each reaction stage can be organically combined without interference. In addition, we also want to modify the fiber corporeal through rational design of proteins, so that it has the ability to break down the structure of cell wall, and finally achieve the effect of degrading lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose.
https://teams.igem.org/3551	High School	The bio-degradation of the insecticide acephate using genetically modified Escherichia coli is studied in this project. Acephate exposure causes severe environmental and human side effects as well as paralysis or death. In this study, we enriched samples of acephate-treated soil for 5 weeks to propagate the growth of acephate-degrading bacteria. 10g from each sample was diluted 10-fold. DNA was subsequently extracted from bacterial colonies using the genomic etNA extraction and the 16S rRNA gene was sequenced. Degradation was monitored with HPLC and LC-MS. Certain genes, such as OPD, were isolated and analyzed using bioinformatics tools including CDD. Amplified genes were inserted into base plasmid pMMB206 using restriction digest protocol into E. coli K12. BetI, a transcription factor-based kill-switch, was added to the plasmid. While experiments could not be performed, MATLAB modeling and literature indicate the approach provides an effective pathway, with >99% degradation of acephate and all harmful intermediates.

Recently, various e-pilis were discovered but not suitable for large-scale production due to the severe cultivation conditions and bio-safety concern. This year, LINKS_China designed PICACHU, an E.coli chassis to express different e-pilis. We manufactured a pili-generator consists of 12 genes for pili assembly, expressed three pilins, and created a new measurement to verify the pili production. Furthermore, we renovate the generator and optimize the growth condition of the cells to increase the yield. Ultimately, we transformed the e-pilis product into a nanowire battery and expect it to provide sustainable clean energy. We are aiming to apply PICACHU to track migrant birds, to monitor the wetland, and to trace the trash flowing movement in the ocean. Hopefully, more possibilities of e-pili application will be explored in the future.

With increasing ocean temperatures, coral reefs and the ecosystems that depend on them are at risk of serious, irreversible damage. Coral bleaching is a result of heat-induced oxidative stress, which triggers the ejection of corals microalgal-symbiont Symbiodinium spp. PROTECC Coral aims to improve the heat tolerance of coral by introducing small heat shock proteins alongside a glutathione recycling enzyme system into Symbiodinium spp., in order to reduce cellular stress. By engaging in conversations with various stakeholders (tourism industries, local councils, bioprospecting practices, commercial and recreational fishing and the GBRs traditional owners) and integrating their advice, our team hopes to contribute to a worldwide conservation effort that enables future generations, both Australian and non-Australian alike, to enjoy the GBR in its entirety.
https://teams.igem.org/3559	Software	DNA assembly is a vital first step in most synthetic biology projects. As genetic design spaces become larger with more complex genetic circuits and greater diversity of parts, the ability to construct sizable genetic libraries with high accuracy in a cost and time-efficient manner is imperative. While automation is an attractive and increasingly affordable solution, programming remains a technical challenge for many wet-lab scientists. To make automated workflows a practical reality, we developed SOAP Lab, an open-source web UI that infers genetic circuit designs from SBOL data files and customizes an assembly plan based on the users specifications. This is then used to generate ready-to-run scripts for the liquid handlers, along with set-up instructions and logs for traceability and debugging. SOAP Lab is integrable into larger software pipelines through the use of SBOL data standards, empowering labs with access to a wider suite of tools available for computer-aided biology.
https://teams.igem.org/3560	High School	Phosphorus is an essential element for plants. Martian soil, while rich in phosphorus, is still unable to sustain a growing plant because the insoluble phosphorus cannot be absorbed directly by plants. Some microorganisms can secrete organic acids, decrease pH and promote dissolution of insoluble phosphates. Considering the higher radiation level on Mars, in this project we choose Deinococcus radiodurans (DR) as our chassis organism. We transformed DR by cloning gcd gene from Escherichia coli to promote dissolution of insoluble phosphates. Glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) and Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) genes are constitutively expressed in DR to form holoenzyme to realize the conversion of glucose into gluconic acid. To improve efficiency, we also transformed a synthesized gabY gene into DR to promote the binding between GDH and PQQ to increase the activity of GDH. We hope to provide new solutions to transform martian soil and explore the possibility of growing crops on Mars.

It also holds biomedical applications such as acting as a drug carrier and is utilised in cancer treatment. However, palladium is an environmental pollutant and difficult to be recycled. In this project, twenty-five palladium(II) reducing peptides (PdRp) are modified from a selection of known palladium binding peptides. The PdRp are fused to a cellulose binding domain 3 (CBD 3) derived from Clostridium thermocellum which acts as an affinity tag. The PdRp-CBD complex is expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) in pETBlue-2 vector and purified using regenerated amorphous cellulose (RAC). Peptide-Palladium interactions are determined by computational methods of Molecular Dynamics. Downstream analysis and further experiments will be performed to determine the efficiency and performance of the PdRp with potassium hexachloropalladate.
https://teams.igem.org/3562	Therapeutics	We aimed at rationally engineering probiotics to address the problem of nosocomial infections in respiratory tract, especially ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) during COVID-19 pandemic. The chassis of our project was Escherichia coli Nissle 1917, recognized as the most amenable probiotic, and the target pathogen was Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a representative nosocomial pathogen notorious for its quorum sensing-based virulence behaviours. We constructed two modules to endow our chassis with the capability as "the negotiator": (i) Quenching Module: heterologously overexpressing quorum quenching enzymes to parley with "criminals" (P. aeruginosa) by degrading AHLs; and (ii) Sensing Module: sensing PQS and excreting appropriate amounts of chemokines to recruit "police squads" (immune cells) for eradicating pathogens. Notably, we leveraged E. coli lysate-based cell-free system for rapidly prototyping genetic parts of interest, in order to accelerate the design-build-test-learn cycle of our project as well as to give insights into the elegance of cell-free expression renaissance.

Our project provides a narrow spectrum treatment for the Multi-Drug Resistant Bacteria, A. baumannii, through the engineering of naturally found elements, namely, Bacteriophage and Pyocins. Pyocins, as produced by P. aeruginosa, provide single-hit killing kinetics. These are engineered to retarget their specificity by the fusion of a tail fiber of the AP22 Phage (specific to A. baumannii). We have conceptualised a modular system, that can be used to produce a portfolio of designers proteins against the bacterial species we wish to target. Our work also includes the development of a software which computationalizes the protein design process and are applying interesting Machine Learning algorithms to predict which genes are responsible for imparting resistance & susceptibility to strains of bacteria.

Theres no widely-available treatment for these diseases yet. We consider that the best way to give birth to a healthy child is proper pregnancy planning and genetic screening before the conception. During the iGEM 2020 season, our team has developed Genomus  a preconceptional screening system which is capable of significantly reducing the amount of autosomal-recessive mutations in the human population. Genomus consists of three parts: 1. Laboratory where we collect and proceed blood or saliva samples and perform genotyping; 2. Secure database with over 1500 potential parents' genotypes, website and mobile application with algorithms of genotypes comparison using QR-codes for authorized comparison access. 3. User-friendly notification & pregnancy planning guidance system. The main idea of Genomus is to integrate genetic screening in pregnancy planning programms, make it popular and avaible for everyone.

https://teams.igem.org/3569	Diagnostics	Bacterial contamination of drinking water is a huge problem worldwide, causing 780,000 deaths on average each year. With PhastPhage, we intend to create a phage-based biosensor for detecting the presence of E. coli contamination in water sources. Using the stoichiometric gene expression simulator Pinetree, we modeled the genome of bacteriophage T7 in order to determine how we could engineer it to produce large amounts of GFP and shorten the time it takes to lyse bacterial cells during an infection cycle. We determined that the most effective way to achieve this was to place a GFP gene, as well as move a holin gene responsible for lysis proteins, into the genome adjacent to gene 10A, which encodes for a major capsid protein and has the highest level of expression of all of T7s genes. In the future we hope to engineer phage with these changes and confirm our models predictions experimentally.

We designed a quasi-autonomous coculture between the acetogen bacterium Clostridium ljungdahlii and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This system uses minimal resources which are currently considered as waste on spacecraft. As a proof of concept, the yeast has been engineered to produce provitamin A, an essential vitamin for human health. Since astronauts' tastes are altered by physiological changes in their body, we give them the choice to choose their favorite flavors by using optogenetic systems.

To address these problems, we create Maloadis, an integrated automated genetic circuit design platform. Maloadis implement automated top-down design with GeneNet algorithm, and is capable of designing and rating possible genetic circuits according to users requirements. It also exploits the abundant information provided by genetic circuit images by extracting parts and structures from them to search for related previous work through trained neuro network. To improve success rate in wet-lab experiment, Maloadis predicts gene expression level with integrated models, and offers suggestions to shorten experiment cycle using Bayesian Optimization algorithm. We present Maloadis as a de novo approach to facilitate synthetic biology design automation.

Therefore, these grains attracted much attention as the fermentation substrate. Meanwhile, the biodiesel attracted increasing attention as a promising biofuel to replace fossil diesel for the last two decades. In this work, Yarrowia lipolytica has been selected as the model host for biodiesel production. Taking into account the disability to degrade the raw starch of Y. lipolytica, we separately express heterologous alpha&#8209;amylase and glucoamylase enzymes in it. The results showed that the strains expressing glucoamylase were able to grow on starch as the sole carbon source. By optimizing the C/N=100, the total lipid content increases up to 21 % of DCW, which sets up the basis for further studies. In the future, we aim to provide a practical, economical, and environment-friendly method to treat substandard grains and produce biodiesel.

In Quaranskin we developed an at-home sampling kit, protocol and survey, where participants swabbed four body sites for metagenomic analysis. We correlated the diversity and composition of these collected microbiome data to behaviours noted in the surveys to uncover any trends. In parallel, we chose the skin commensal microbe Staphylococcus epidermidis to be a chassis for our future vision of microbial therapeutics enabled by synthetic biology.

A novel protein purification approach is also designed as an industrial solution. The hagfish slime IF is a competitive candidate to replace the polluting man-made fiber. While being biodegradable, it possesses outstanding mechanics that outscore Kevlar. When compared to other developing alternatives, like spider dragline silk, its simpler protein architecture facilitates the production process. We also developed an eco-friendly dyeing method for our threads. By fusing non-toxic chromoproteins to the IF, they can grant a wide range of vivid colors for the fabric, making it a viable clothing material.

Our wet lab team has designed various experiments to clone and express the interacting host and parasite proteins, characterize the drug and reduce the toxicity of the grafted cyclotides. To address issues related to poor diagnostics, we have developed a diagnostic tool using convolutional neural networks which will be able to identify patients with malaria based on images of their blood smears.

Since p-cresol is produced from phenylalanine and tyrosine in diet, we created tyrosine inducer gene, which controls the expression of polyphenol oxidase (PPO)  enzyme that can degrade p-cresol. This system was tested with the Green Fluorescent Protein gene on the p15A linear plasmid. We extracted the pchC  pchF  pchA operon gene segment from Pseudomonas citronellolis and connected onto the p15A linear plasmid skeleton to assist PPO with degrading p-cresol under oxygen-deficient environment (intestine).

Majority of these compounds are known to be potent carcinogens. They are found in pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, processed meats, alcoholic beverages, cigarette smoke, suspended particulate matter (spm) etc. But, their presence in potable water post disinfection stage in water treatment plants is most alarming; as their formation depends upon temperature and pH and not on the precursor molecules forming them. Quantifying them through conventional techniques of LC/MS, GC/MS, HPLC, etc., is time consuming, labour intensive and an costly affair.

Concentrations of cocaine as low as 30 ng/L have been shown by studies to have detrimental impacts upon their migration and breeding patterns. In addition to this, high drug concentrations have even been detected in drinking water in countries such as Brazil due to lack of effective filtration systems. We aim to solve this problem by using genetically modified E. coli bacteria immobilised in the primary sedimentation tanks of the sewers.

Replacing antibodies with aptamers - a type of oligonucleotide - in LFIAs (Lateral Flow ImmunoAssay), several drawbacks that antibodies present (low heat stability, heavy reliance on immunogenicity of target molecules, etc.) are eliminated. Simultaneously, we developed a sandwich assay involving both aptamers and antibodies, combining the benefits of using either ligand. scFvs (Single-Chained antibody Fragments) have simpler structures and can be made through regular protein synthesis procedures, while conventional processes involve the mammalian immune system. Applying ELISA (Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay) to our design, we immobilize purified scFv onto the ALFA pad, then coat our samples - amanitin - onto the scFvs. BSA-conjugated aptamers are then coated to the amanitin. Hopefully, this test kit will assist in identification of common species of poisonous mushrooms, reducing cases of poisonings worldwide.
https://teams.igem.org/3594	High School	Locust plague is a harmful disaster, because gigantic locust swarms can eat crops and cause food crisis. However, the existing prevention measures are expensive and not environmentally friendly. Locust plague is mainly caused by the colonizing locusts, while the scattered locusts need to be initiated by serotonin and guaiacol to form colonized locusts. Therefore, we proposed a design to allow E. coli to express four enzymes to degrade serotonin and guaiacol in the intestines of the locusts. To enhance the degradation efficiency, we introduced a self-lysis system in E. coli to allow the enzymes release to the intestinal lumen of locust, which helps ultimately disturb the swarming behavior of locust and avoid the occurrence of locust plagues. For biosafety, we have also introduced a heat-induced suicide switch, which allows E. coli to commit suicide in response to the summer heat when the plagues are reduced.

Besides, patients who undergo enterostomy are confronting social distancing because of the acrid smell released from the stoma on their bellies. To solve the problems above, We genetically engineered probiotic Escherichia coli to decrease the production of main molecules that contribute to intestinal acrid smell (ammonia and hydrogen sulfide) and produce an aroma substance (myrcene). We mutate argA into argAfbr and knockout argR to enhance the conversion of ammonia into arginine, create several mutants of cysE gene to promote the conversion of hydrogen sulfide into cysteine, and construct a three-plasmids-system to produce myrcene. The result shows we significantly improved e.coli's ammonia production and cysteine synthesis; myrcene was produced successfully in relatively low production.

Traditional treatment to acne vulgaris involving antibiotics may trigger drug resistance in acne pathogenic bacteria, especially Propionibacterium. acnes. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are considered excellent alternatives of antibiotics for their capability of providing effective, broad-spectrum defenses against infections and exhibiting relatively low potential to elicit resistance. However, AMP curing products nowadays are not abundant, and most AMPs are produced via chemosynthesis, a rather costly method incapable of yielding AMPs with great antimicrobial potency. Therefore, we aim to create an anti-acne product which consists of biosynthesized P. acnes killing AMPs, adhesive/cohesive proteins, and tyrosinase.

https://teams.igem.org/3599	High School	Locust plague has been one of the devastating disasters to humans and the environment. Both chemical and biological pesticides were widely used, but because of the rapid movement and unpredictability of locust swarms, these methods are costly and cause serious environmental problems. We designed a rapidly deployable locust attraction scheme, the core of which is to synthesis specific locust aggregation pheromone 4-Vinylanisole to attract locusts and prepare for further rapid and effective eradication in the attraction area. Furthermore, an engineered bacteria which can degrade phenylacetonitrile was successfully created, avoiding its interference to the trapping effect. Through synthesis of 4-Vinylanisole and degradation of Phenylacetonitrile, locusts are attracted together and the site-specific control of locust swarms is realized. Our project provides a more environmentally friendly and greener way to kill locusts in the future.
https://teams.igem.org/3600	Food & Nutrition	Water is an essential resource that we regularly use for drinking, cooking and food processing. Hence, it is important to ensure that it is safe for consumption. EspressEAU serves as an analysis of general water quality. We aimed to create a safe, low-cost, and easy-to-use system that can enable on-site testing of water at home or in small communities. We hypothesized that genetically engineered yeast could be used as biosentinels by hijacking the yeast stress response pathway using either deletion strains or fluorescent reporter strains that are sensitive to water contaminants. These biosentinels are grown in a DIY system with temperature control, stirring, and two optical detectors for fluorescence and density, allowing us to monitor growth and fluorescence of the yeast, and thus detect the presence of contaminants in the water sample. We hope our project will facilitate frequent water testing of local water sources.
https://teams.igem.org/3601	Environment	The worlds oceans are suffocating from an annual addition of 8 million tons of plastic which threaten marine ecosystems and exacerbate water scarcity affecting over 2 billion lives. Our project aims to tackle these two global challenges by integrating enzymatic polyethylene terephthalate (PET) degradation into a Microbial Desalination Cell (MDC). The system involves a 2-step process co-culturing engineered E. coli to express a PETase-MHETase fusion degrading PET and P. putida to achieve further degradation and produce lactate, which then supports the biofilm growth of exoelectrogen, S. oneidensis, generating bioelectricity for desalination. Desalination efficiency was maximised by optimising lactate secretion, co-culture design, and MDC configuration based on the results from flux balance analysis (FBA) and agent-based model, simulating bacterial plastic degradation and bioelectricity production, respectively. Insights for further technical optimisation and feasible implementation at large scales were obtained through iterative engagement with experts and stakeholders.

The doctors must take a small biopsy of the patients prostate or let the patient undergo a digital rectal exam. Our team decided to develop a risk assessment for prostate cancer, that makes use of the CRISPR-Cas13a system. We focused on three mRNA biomarkers found to be present in the urine of PCa patients, specifically TMPRSS2:ERG, AMACR and PCA3. We also conducted interviews with end-users and initiated an email correspondence with experts from different fields to discuss and gain insight on how to improve our project. Apart from this, we designed a set of playing cards and a card game that takes early detection as a theme and was distributed to different social areas to spread PCa awareness.

https://teams.igem.org/3606	Food & Nutrition	In Asia, many old people suffer from insufficient calcium intake and related diseases such as osteoporosis. Considering that traditional calcium supplementation is not efficient and user-friendly enough, we intended to develop a kind of engineered bacteria based on E. coli that can colonize in the human intestine and secrete peptides to promote calcium absorption. We introduced the quorum sensing system to colonize bacteria in the intestine. Once the bacteria have successfully colonized the intestinal tract, the luxpR promoter will be activated and a series of short peptides that can bind to calcium and promote calcium absorption of intestinal epithelial cells will be expressed. A kill switch is added accordingly for safety. Our project provides a novel delivery method to provide calcium supplements sustainably. And we are actively seeking commercialization possibilities to expand our project impact, to reach more population, for the elderly's good health and well-being.

https://teams.igem.org/3610	New Application	Bacterial contamination in water is a global issue that affects developing nations and first world countries. Even Switzerland, famed for its drinking water, faces over 400 cases of Legionnaires disease annually. But plants have been combating microbial pathogens for far longer than humans and we believe there is a lot to learn from them. That is why we are developing a biosensor based on plant pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), which are cell surface receptors of the plant immune system, that dimerize in the presence of microbes. We designed a system based on EFR, FLS2, CORE and their coreceptor BAK1, which recognize a broad spectrum of bacteria. We fused a split-luciferase to our receptors in order to quantify the total bacterial load of a water sample based on the luminescence-output. We achieved the expression of PRRs in yeast, which opens the door to future applications of PRRs as biosensors.
https://teams.igem.org/3611	WIKI	Traditional detection of environmental Covid-19 employs quantitative PCR method, with a minimum turnaround time of 6-hour. Here, we developed a rapid protocol, in which the presence of Covid-19 S protein is readily detected by genetically engineered Ace2-PmrA-PmrB system. In our work, we recombined the PmrA-PmrB two-component system derived from Salmonella to the surface of E. coli, and replaced the Fe(III) recognition site of PmrB with the core region of human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)&#65292;which could recognize the surface spike glycoprotein (S protein) of SARS-CoV-2. Upon recognition, the downstream signal pathways and the reporter gene are activated. Furthermore, an amplifier (Hrp regulatory machinery) and extra cytoplasmic function (ECF) &#963; factor were used to improve the sensitivity of the biosensor. A TEV protease-based post-translational regulation system to reduce the leakage is also used. In summary, our system shortens the time frame and reduces the cost and lab labors for detection.
https://teams.igem.org/3612	Food & Nutrition	In the Peruvian highlands, frosts during the winter cause crop damage leading to significant economic losses for small and medium scale farmers, perpetuating their already vulnerable condition. Our team wants to approach this problem by bringing an innovative solution. We aim to develop a system of production of an antifreeze agent which has a protective capacity in frost-susceptible crops, administrable by spraying. This product consists of a solution of recombinantly expressed and purified antifreeze proteins (AFPs). Our core genetic designs comprise the sequences of three types of AFPs, of plant and insect origin, with inducible and constitutive promoters, and a peptide signal for secretion to the culture medium. The chassis we have selected is a psychrophilic bacteria of the Pseudoalteromonas genus in order to guarantee an efficient work at low-temperature settings. In this way, our system will be capable of producing AFPs in low-tech environments in frost-affected regions.
https://teams.igem.org/3613	Therapeutics	Despite cancer being one of the leading causes of death, successful treatment remains a challenge due to the heterogeneous nature of tumors. While a multitude of treatment options exist including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy, they all have significant limitations and have prompted the development of alternative therapies such as bacteriotherapy. While certain bacteria have shown great therapeutic potential, different bacteria are involved in unique tumor suppressing pathways, and as a result, a combination of various tumor-suppressing bacteria have been shown to achieve the greatest efficacy. However, these microbes require genetic modification to lower potential toxicity and eliminate any side effects on normal cells. Our team proposes a classification algorithm to first classify whether a bacteria affects a tumor-resisting pathway, and then feeding this information into our Generative Adversarial Network to create a synthetic bacterial genome with multiple tumor-suppressing features while also being clinically significant.

However, arsenate accumulation poses a severe threat to the rice-consuming population, who are generally unaware of the threat and unable to deal with it. We decided to lower the arsenate accumulation of rice by identifying and modifying the genetic sequence related to the arsenate level. Specially, we adopted both the conventional method and the bioinformatic method to identify the related genetic sequence. By doing so, we intended to promote the fusion of bioinformatics and bioengineering. The assumption is that Ospt4 is responsible for the arsenate accumulation of many crop species, including rice. We planned to knock out the genetic sequence and perform contrast experiments to examine whether Ospt4 is related to arsenate accumulation.

Optimal treatment requires constant monitoring, but current testing methods are invasive, time-consuming, and costly. CIDosis strives to change this with a non-invasive patch for self-monitoring. Backed by extensive computer modeling, we are developing a biosensor that continuously collects sweat from the skin, and produces a color reflecting the level of inflammation. The biosensor in our patch is based on Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells equipped with interleukin-specific receptors that will associate in the presence of interleukins, resulting in the intracellular complementation of a split protein. A transduction pathway is then triggered, leading to the production of a color, whose intensity is logged by an app and shared with a medical professional. By integrating the wishes of patients living with CIDs, as well as experts within these fields, CIDosis brings a next generation tool for patient empowerment.

This potentially fatal heavy metal is a neurotoxin that accumulates in soft tissue and bones, leading to neurological disorders. In 2017, exposure to lead caused one million deaths worldwide. Current water filtration solutions are effective; however, they are not affordable, sustainable, or renewable. Our team is genetically engineering a bacteria that naturally filters lead to have biosensing properties, allowing easy detection of lead ion levels in solution by monitoring lead operon activation for lead filtration. The modified bacteria will express fluorescent proteins that allow us to visually monitor lead ion concentration sustainably and affordably. Our goal is to provide a user-friendly, accessible lead detection and filtration device to ensure safe drinking water globally.

After AMP and subsequent protease expression, we will trigger the already developed Deadman kill switch and sonicate the cells in order to make sure that no live genetically modified microorganisms will be present in the product and that the AMPs are free in the solution. The resulting product is a cell extract containing soluble AMPs, which will serve as a biopesticide.

If the coral reefs remain bleached, they would proceed to eventual death, and destruction of the marine ecosystem. Hainan_China aims to develop a nutritional enhancement strategy to safeguard coral reefs against the devastation by coral bleaching. We plan to introduce synthetically engineered probiotics to stimulate coral microbiota for sustainability of Zooxanthellae-bacterial interaction and viable metabolic functioning of the coral systems. The probiotics would enable production of nutrients, such as N, P, Fe, and Vitamin B12 to nourish the coral symbiosis against environmental stresses. We will then design and fabricate a microfluidic chip to study in-depth the coral-Zooxanthellae symbiosis for large scale applications.

Additionally, we want to address human health and the negative perception of GM food. We want to produce AMPs that also enhance the potatoes nutritional value and health effects. AMPs useful against Fusarium may also have effects against human pathogens, making their ingestion beneficial. One example is the bovine AMP BMAP-18, which has antimicrobial effects against trypanosoma, the cause of sleeping sickness. By creating GMOs with beneficial effects for consumers, we hope to alleviate the stigma of GM food and increase its public acceptance.
https://teams.igem.org/3625	Diagnostics	Colon cancer worldwide affects over 1.80 million people with approximately 862,000 deaths each year. Recent scientific literature highlights a correlation between colon cancer and the presence of colibactin in patients bowels, produced by Escherichia coli found in the colon of 20% of people. Therefore, to aid early detection we will develop a better diagnostic tool for the detection of colon cancer reliant upon modifying a DNA-binding protein. By engineering the transcriptional repressor MmfR of the TetR family, the binding of a colibactin derivative will prevent the binding of our new protein to DNA. The ligand-binding pocket of MmfR will be modified in-silico to ensure it accommodates a colibactin derivative - N-myristoyl-D-asparagine - instead of its native ligand. Specific amino acids mutated within the MmfR protein will be identified. Finally, the engineered protein will be overproduced and isolated. We expect resulting engineered proteins to be accurate and precise biosensors for colibactin.

In this phase-I project, we propose a SynBio-based therapeutic solution for COVID-19. Our approach consists of a SARS-CoV-2-like particle that is capable of targeting cells expressing the ACE2 receptor. Upon delivery, our sensing moiety (Toehold Riboswitch adjusted for mammalian systems) is constitutively expressed. If SARS-CoV-2 triggers are present within the cell, the sensor will unfold initiating a GAL4-VP16-dependent interference pathway. Consequently, we designed two de novo siRNAs that play a critical role in our antiviral therapeutic approach. They inhibit viral replication via RISC-mediated degradation of the replicase region of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA. We also created a deterministic model to predict the levels of siRNAs as well as a structural model to predict the thermodynamic stability of our toehold riboswitches.

To address this shortage, we created Viralizer: an interactive online database that contains over 26,000 mutated spike protein sequences and their corresponding structures, developed using homology modeling in PyRosetta. This allows the user to analyze the effects of spike protein mutations on the functionality of the protein and its binding with potential antibodies. The spike protein database is paired with a phylogenetic tree that characterizes the propagation of the virus over space and time. We also developed a genetic algorithm that uses spike protein structures and their binding energies to design hundreds of potential antibodies that bind to the spike protein and reduce its binding affinity to the ACE-2 receptor on cells.

Until now, it is still common that patients forget to take meds or are unable to do so due to tremoring and dystonia. The predicament has severely affected the potency of drugs and accelerating the progress of the disease. Therefore, we design SKIP (Special Kit Invented for Parkinson's disease). Light-inducible bacteria, along with devices that carry LED, are first implanted into patients intestine. A bracelet will detect tremors when it occurs and sends signals to doctors, who would administrate L-dopa and send the signal back into the device that is implanted in the intestine. Receiving the signal, the LED will illuminate, which induces the light-inducible bacteria to produce L-dopa. Being capable to achieve instant feedback and remote regulation, SKIP has the potential to be applied to variable conditions.

Oviita aims to equip these vulnerable regions with a sustainable and community-based solution to VAD. Our solution uses a food-safe strain of Yarrowia lipolytica modified to produce beta-carotene, a Vitamin A precursor. By engineering this yeast to produce cellulase, VAD communities can grow it as their own vitamin A supplement using readily-available plant matter as feedstock. To facilitate community integration, we designed bioreactor schematics based on locally-available resources, and made the yeast auxotrophic to ensure safe growth with no environmental risk. We also created a Vitamin A biosensor to improve VAD testing, and included an anthelmintic agent in the yeast to combat poor intestinal health, two contributing factors to VAD. Through these solutions, Oviita aims to be a sustainable and community-based adjunct to global efforts against VAD.

However, the removal of biofilm in large aquariums is time-consuming and relies on inefficient labor through scrubbing. To address these concerns, we engineered the BL21 bacteria strain of E.coli to detect and biodegrade biofilms. The T7 promoter drives the expression of LuxR, which recognizes the signaling molecule AHL that is secreted by biofilms. Combined with AHL, LuxR would bind to the pLuxR to express the adhesive protein, Ag43, and digestive enzymes, DNase and protease. Our engineered bacteria will bind to the biofilm and degrade it efficiently.

However, more common synthetic dyes may damage the hair cortex and cause allergies. Despite increasing attention to natural dyes, its production is limited and products are expensive. We propose using engineered bacteria to mass-produce natural, harmless hair dyes. We successfully synthesized melanin, indigo, dopaxanthin, and indoline-betacyanin and dyed hair into black, blue, and red. We used Vibrio natriegens to increase the rate of production. V. natriegens could produce melanin faster than E. coli. Furthermore, considering that synthetic dyes are composed of oxidants and pigment precursors, we envisage combining oxidases and pigment precursors to dye hair. We have expressed bacterial laccase and tested its activity. Next, we will try to optimize dyeing protocols and discuss the safety aspects of potential products. If successful, our products could bring dramatic changes to the market and introduce substantial social benefits.

For some viral diseases, genotype detection is crucial for successful treatment, and hepatitis C is one of them. Nobel Prize 2020 was awarded for the fight against hepatitis &#1057;, a major global health problem that causes cirrhosis and liver cancer. Hepatitis C is caused by hepatitis C virus (HCV) that has at least six different genotypes. Recombinant variant RF2k/1b is common in Russia, but it is often mistaken for genotype 1 that leads to incorrect treatment. However, a lot of infected people in Russia do not know their HCV genotype because of expensive testing or the impossibility to perform tests in peripheral regions. So, we are developing an easy-to-use portable Cas-based device HaploSense to solve this problem. HaploSense can be optimized for genotypes detection of any RNA viruses, including HIV or Sars-CoV-2, and may become a universal detection platform.

In Sri Lanka, it affects the livelihood of 1.8 million farmers and the lack of proper post-harvest technology is costing them 2393 million dollars annually. The fungi that are present in the storage of rice are Aspergillus spp. In this project, we establish a stringent post-harvest management system for rice by measuring the concentration of aflatoxin B1, a toxin produced by Aspergillus spp. To measure the concentration of AFB1, we used the enzyme, cytochrome P450 1A2. Reactions between AFB1 and CYP1A2 result in compounds with epoxide residue, which can be used for the detection. Here, we also proposed a nonparametric MARS model designed to capture possible inter-dependent effects of environmental factors on fungal infection of stored rice.

Iron is required for photosynthesis and is critical for the base of the marine food web. A better ability to capture iron could increase phytoplankton populations which would have benefits such as reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide by acting as a carbon sink. We decided to engineer Synechococcus (cyanobacteria) because it consumes high levels of CO2, has a high replication rate, and has been used by many previous iGEM teams. Our project will engineer cyanobacteria to transport iron into cells and reduce it to the bioavailable Fe(II) form. The increased iron utilization will increase photosynthesis and growth of phytoplankton. To prevent harmful phytoplankton blooms, a kill switch will also be added to the cells to prevent overgrowth of cells if iron concentration increased significantly. These modifications will stabilize the marine food chain and absorb CO2 from the atmosphere.

The goal of this project is to produce an effective theoretical siRNA treatment, PreeclampsiRNA, using recombinant lentiviral vectors to carry and deliver shRNA to the trophoblast to inhibit the translation of soluble Fms-like tyrosine kinase (sFlt1-14), an antiangiogenic pseudo-receptor that captures placental growth factor (PlGF) and prevents it from binding the proper receptor, which would signal for angiogenesis. We would test several different shRNA sequences to see which causes the most effective reduction of sFlt1-14.

To achieve our goal, we developed a novel hydrogel-based skin-screen containing "decoy proteins" particles that reduce the virus's ability to infect. Our product will be effective for hours, wont damage the skins microbiome and will be easily removed with water. To capture the "S", well use a mutated ACE2 (engineered for stronger linkage), and/or Sybodies (synthetic single-domain nanobodies) with the full antigen-binding capacity specifically to those "S". We have two delivery directions for both proteins: Microgel beads that strongly bind His-tagged proteins, and B.subtilis spore surface display technique. ACT. provides an active prophylactic solution that ensures further hurdles for the viral infection, thus flattening the curve.
https://teams.igem.org/3654	High School	Production of high-quality recycled paper through biodegradation of lignin can decrease chemical byproducts and wastewater generated by existing paper production processes to significant environmental and economic benefit. Treating box paper and newspaper with laccase and dye decolorizing peroxidase (DyP) during the recycling process produced paper with improved brightness, texture, and permanence. The results demonstrate that synthetic biology can be used to produce recycled paper in a more environmentally friendly manner compared to chemical treatments used to produce recycled paper today. In addition, we have developed a biosensor and fluorometer pair to detect and measure phenolic compounds that are produced when lignin is dissolved. The pair can be used to monitor progress of lignin degradation in the paper recycling process and detect phenolic compounds in the environment. By expressing transporter of phenolic compounds in E.Coli, we have been able to obtain improved sensitivity compared to existing biosensors.

We decided to use the biomimetic method of enzyme (carbonic anhydrase), which has the advantages of safety, high catalytic efficiency and environment-friendly compared with other methods of capturing and concentrating CO2. We designed an efficient and stable CA by improving the catalytic performance of CA from thermophilic bacteria and the biological stability of capturing CO2. We use computer-aided analysis software to predict the ideal mutation site of the protein. Then we carried out enzyme-substrate molecular docking and enzyme-solvent kinetics simulation, constructed wild-type and mutant CA prokaryotic expression vectors, and expressed and purified the protein. Finally, we carried out functional identification to determine whether the activity of the mutant protein changed and whether the thermal stability was significantly improved.

Of them all, fusion proteins, which are often too large and inflexible, take the spotlight, allowing for a modular approach to protein engineering. To mediate interactions between all three core components of life more flexible we aim to harness the power and flexibility of RNAs We apply machine learning to design flexible RNA modules and binding proteins for assembling complexes of protein domains, RNA and DNA in a sequence-specific manner. In addition, we engineer trans-splicing ribozymes to reconfigure our RNAs and proteins at the transcript level. Also, we apply molecular modelling to provide tools to design specific RNA-binding proteins. Taken together, we provide a controllable, compact, and dynamical alternative to fusion proteins with applications to drug delivery and expand the toolbox of synthetic biology.
https://teams.igem.org/3658	Diagnostics	NYUAD iGEM is developing a rapid, point-of-care, field fungal diagnostic device. Since the mid-1900s, a flesh-eating fungal disease, chytridiomycosis, has been condemning more amphibian species to extinction than any other pathogen ever recorded wiping out over 90 species and causing declines in at least 500. Similar fungal diseases have also been affecting other animals such as bats, disrupting their hibernation and leaving millions dead in their paths. Usage of diagnostics for managing spread has been limited due to the testing methods being latent, expensive, and non-portable. Following a rigorous approach at research and design, the first stage of the project involves prototyping DNA extraction methods such as bead beating and lysis buffers, reaction mediums such as microfluidics and paper-based biosensors, amplification methods such as RPA CRISPR-Cas12a and reporting mechanisms such as fluorescence and LFA, in addition to a database and API that can integrate with any existing surveillance system.
https://teams.igem.org/3659	Village	Abstract: CRISPRi is a powerful tool for modulating gene expression in human cells. By designing a gRNA homologous to the target gene of interest, one can achieve targeted knockdown of the specific gene of interest. However, with current methodologies, one has to screen multiple gRNA sequences for efficient targeting while minimizing off-target effects. We present a prediction model for identifying the best gRNA sequence for efficient gene targeting in human cells. Starting with experimental data from knocking down specific genes using several gRNAs in iPS cells, we leverage machine learning to inform better selection of the gRNA. Our tool will be invaluable for designing gene targeting gRNAs and will reveal underlying biochemical principles governing CRISPR efficiency.

Over time, that plastic material does not biodegrade, but breaks down into tiny particles known as microplastics, and enter the food chain. Last year, we observed a strain, which can degrade PE and PS. This year, based on last year's study, we made some improvements and conducted further exploration work. Our project have two parts. The first part is to degrade PE into alkanesIn. We construct an artificial metabolic pathway and use surface display to express Laccase on the surface of spores, making the reaction more efficient and intuitive. The second part is to use those metabolites to synthesize environmentally-friendly material PHFA (poly hydroxyl fatty acid). Based on genome sequencing and synthetic biology, we constructed another engineered bacteria to utilize plastics to synthetic value-added products such as PHFA.

Prevention of contaminated soil is closely related to health problems in soil-plant-animal-human system. Here, we designed a "walking" biological platform for the detection and remediation of mercury contaminated soil. Multifunctional engineering bacteria were cultured, with MerR-dependent hypersensitive switch, mercury monitor, and mercury stabilizer. Once mercury ions are found in the soil, multifunctional engineering bacteria scattered in the soil can be activated, releasing chromogenic protein and stabilizing mercury ions in the form of HgS with low toxicity. Moreover, considering engineering bacteria move slowly in the soil and is greatly affected by the environment, we choose earthworm as the walking carrier. The engineering bacteria will be reproduced in the earthworm body and move through soil followed with the earthworm to monitor and remedy mercury contaminated soil movably.
https://teams.igem.org/3666	Foundational Advance	Our ability to control the function of engineered microbes is limited within hard to reach places, such as deep within human tissue, the rhizosphere surrounding crops, or pipes in manufacturing facilities. The field of magnetogenetics has begun to consider how magnetic fields could affect biological molecules and cells. In our project, we aim to control the function of bacteria via the remote activation of an alternating magnetic field (AMF). E. coli will be engineered to respond to magnetic stimuli by attaching magnetic nanoparticles to the surface of the bacterial membrane in conjunction with cytoplasmic temperature-sensitive transcriptional repressors to regulate gene expression of the green fluorescent protein. Upon AMF stimulation, magnetic nanoparticles heat up and increase cytoplasmic temperature, thereby inducing a conformational change of the repressor dimers and allowing transcription of target genes. This technology critically couples alternating magnetic field stimulation with thermal sensitive parts to enable wireless control of bacteria.

An array of contamination was left behind due to the materials and explosives used, devastating the biodiversity, and increasing health risks for the Viequenses. Initiatives to clean the waters and soil of Vieques exist; however, it has been a costly and lengthy process. iGEM RUM-UPRM proposes Mer-Nite, a solution to decrease the contamination in Vieques due to the military practices. Phase 1 of the project consisted of designing a genetic system to absorb and bioremediate mercury through the expression of the mer operon, combined with a second circuit that will be activated upon the presence of RDX and degrade the contaminant through the expression of the xplA and xplB genes. Mer-Nite represents an alternative solution to decrease the contamination, conserve biodiversity, and improve the quality of life in Vieques.

https://teams.igem.org/3675	Village	Pinus pinaster is a tree species native to the Mediterranean region and susceptible to Pine Wilt Disease (PWD), a deadly pest caused by a nematode, Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, that affects several areas across the globe, including Portugal. The transmission of this disease is mediated by insect vectors, pine sawyer beetles of the genus Monochamus, that carry B. xylophilus inside their tracheal system and on their body surfaces. Currently, the most used control methods include the elimination of attacked trees, the use of traps to capture the vector insect or spraying trees with insecticides to prevent the insect vectors maturation feeding. We aim using our knowledge in synthetic biology to prevent the economic and environmental damage caused by PWD by introducing in the pine trees microbiome a genetically engineered Pseudomonas putida, capable of producing the nematicidal compound spectinabilin when triggered by the trees stress response under the attack of the insect vector.

It is intended to serve as an interim treatment in a pandemic scenario that can be manufactured cheaply and quickly with limited lab access while a vaccine is developed. Using ensemble machine learning and differential evolution algorithms, we optimized anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody sequences to enhance binding affinity and therapeutic potential. We designed and computationally validated a novel DNA origami nanostructure to selectively deliver the optimized antibody sequences to immune cells for rapid antibody production in vivo. The high potency of the optimized antibodies and the specificity of DNA origami delivery reduce the minimum therapeutic dose, thereby reducing treatment cost. Our work is a proof-of-concept of a rapid, cost-effective antibody treatment for COVID-19 that can also be extended to treating other emerging diseases.

Lacking access to a wet lab, the team has designed and modeled an isothermal CRISPR-based diagnostic that employs two DNA-programmed catalytically dead Cas13 (dCas13) recognition domains, each fused to part of a split beta-lactamase. A color change occurs upon reconstitution of the enzyme, and we predict with reasonable confidence that the signal will be visible to the human eye after 30 minutes. Three separate G-blocks will be used in conjunction with 3A assembly to clone the two dCas13-split-lactamase ORFs.

By utilizing the nature of strong binding interactions between hACE2 and the spike of SARS-CoV-2, we deeply believe that we would be able to reap the benefits of viral evolution. In order to achieve our goals, we engineered a protein construct that includes the hACE2 receptor binding domain, a linker, and a protease that is specific at cleaving spike proteins. The protein construct functions as a capture device and can be implemented on many occasions, such as masks, contact lenses, and even filtration devices, as a mean to capture, destroy, and even quantify the amount of virus particles on a particular surface, so as to reduce the number of SARS-CoV-2 and, moreover, decline the possibility of infection on human beings.
https://teams.igem.org/3683	Village	Traditionally, measuring the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 requires a live virus which creates serious biosafety concerns. We wanted to create a safe alternative, utilizing a general assay system, to identify the infectivity of different current and future strains of SARS-CoV-2, as it is critical for assessing outbreak control and immunity of potential vaccines. Infectivity of different strains can be measured by the binding affinity between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of Spike protein (S protein) and its human ACE2 receptor, which is how the virus gains entry into human cells. Various genetic mutations in the S protein affect the RBD-ACE2 interaction, therefore contributing to different infectivities. We engineered a pseudovirus to recap this crucial interaction by expressing S proteins corresponding to the original and the predominant G614D SARS-CoV-2 strains and used a luciferase assay to quantitatively measure infectivity.

For this, we used the ice nucleation proteins (INPs) from Pseudomonas syringae, which facilitates ice formation. As the formation of ice crystals in clouds plays an essential role in many environments, this protein could be very interesting to use as a potential alternative to silver iodide in cloud seeding. To anticipate on legislation issues regarding GMOs, we designed INP producing E. coli cells that can be induced to leak their cellular contents according to the bacterial ghost principle.

The Trypanosome Lytic Factor Apolipoprotein L-1 (APOL1) is a pore-forming protein known to kill all types of trypanosomes in baboons. While cattle lack APOL1, from the genome-wide BLAST we found cattle APOL3 (c-APOL3) which is the closest homolog of baboon APOL1 (b-APOL1). Sequence alignment analysis showed that c-APOL3 lacked 38 residues in N-terminus and had differences in C-terminus domain. Further, structure prediction analysis via HHPred and RaptorX indicated that the N-terminus might interact with the C-terminus to maximize pore-forming potential in the b-APOL1, though c-APOL3 lacked these interactions. Therefore, chimeric proteins with a combination of N and C-termini from b-APOL1 in native c-APOL3 were designed and investigated for function using bioinformatics. The capability of CRISPR for insertion of chimeric genes into the host genome and physiological functional assays are being performed.

However, bio-production is costly compared to chemical synthesis, as it is highly energy-consuming for the cell and product extraction is laborious. To increase competitiveness, we engineer yeast to accumulate high lipid levels by using light both as an inductor for metabolic switch and as an electron source. Further, yeast is designed to self-lyse after production. First, we introduce extra copies of lipid synthesizing enzymes controlled by light-inducible promoters. Next, we coat the cells with light-absorbing nanoparticles to enable the cells to use light as an electron source for NADPH formation  a critical cofactor for lipid synthesis. This leads to increased carbon flux to lipid production. To ease the product extraction, the cells are designed to autolyse by induction of cell wall degrading glucanases that are targeted to cell wall via anchor proteins.

To target both factors, we engineered probiotic E.coli Nissle 1917 to produce BLP-7 with elastin like peptide(ELP) and Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) antagonist with ELP under infrared induction, followed by in-situ assembly of sphere-like nanostructure NANO-AI-Cleaner through ELP-mediated hydrophobic interaction. ELP showed Intelligent temperature-controlled ability and significant skin-repairing effect while BLP-7 kills P. acnes by punching holes on the membrane surface and TLR2 antagonist blocks NF-kB pathway by competing for binding to acylated lipoproteins on the surface of P. acnes. In this way, our multi-functional nanostructure achieves antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and skin-repairing effects at the same time. We have successfully constructed NANO-AI-Cleaner, providing a convincing and promising treatment strategy for acne.
https://teams.igem.org/3713	Environment	Polyethylene terephthalate, or PET, is a plastic abundantly used in packaging and containers. Though PET is the most recycled plastic in the U.S., 3.1 million tons are produced annually and its current recycling rate is only 31%. Traditional remediation methods such as pelleting yield less products for every PET regeneration. Also, the microbial remediation with wild-type PET degrading enzymes (commonly called PETase) cannot be used under many current recycling conditions and has low degradation rates. To generate enzymes with higher degradation rates and thermostability, we developed machine learning algorithms to generate a number of candidate enzyme sequences. These candidate enzymes were then expressed and purified from E. coli BL21 and tested for the improved degradation of PET plastic using the NanoDrop method for validation. Project apPETite is an attempt to provide a framework for developing an enzyme with enhanced PET plastic degradation.
https://teams.igem.org/3714	New Application	We live in a world where monstrous industries operate ruthlessly, while the environment is crowded by numerous unknown hazardous bacteria and virus.  Emergencies could occur without anyone foreseeingby then, a lightning fast detection tool would play a vital role. SJTU-BioX-Shanghai think out of the box, constructing a platform that enables the automatic development of new fast detection test strips. With the help of an in vitro evolution strategy for aptazyme, we can effectively find biosensors for wide-ranging targets. Then two rational designed probes are introduced by our prediction model, which enables our nanogold based lateral flow system to show a positive signal with targets in existence. By virtue of the extremely short development cycle and equipment-free final products, our project possesses a bright prospect.
https://teams.igem.org/3715	Environment	Discarded PET in the environment has caused serious ecological and health problems at present. Enzymatic recycling of PET has been extensively investigated in the past 20 years. PETase is a novel PET-degrading enzyme with the ability to degrade the highly crystallized PET. However, the heat-labile property seriously hinders its industrial applications. To over this limitation, we firstly rationally designed several PETase mutants through our combine bioinformatics strategies. Then we cloned and expressed these mutant genes by using the E. coli system. We next purified all the expressed PETase mutants and tested their thermostability at several conditions. We found 7 of PETase mutants with increasing thermostability. Excitingly, the enzyme activity of one mutant was 163 times that of the wild-type PETase at 60°C that was 20°C higher than the optimum temperature of the wild-type PETase. Our project sheds light on the industrial application of PETase.
https://teams.igem.org/3716	High School	Glycyrrhetinic Acid (GA) is an important herbal extract from the most widely used Chinese herbal medicine Licorice with applications both in the food and pharmaceutical industries. It is an approved effective medicine for peptic ulcers and has expectorant properties, and current research reported potential use for anti-viral, anti-bacterial, and in cancer treatments. The conventional extraction method using hydrolysis of glycyrrhizin (GL) suffers from high cost and high environmental pressure, which undermines its large-scale usage. Syn-bio pathways can potentially lower the cost, and are eco-friendly. Therefore, Team iBowu-China investigated synthetic methods using the enzyme beta-glucuronidase (bG) to hydrolyze GL into GA by experimenting with the coding sequence from different species. Our results indicate the enzyme can be stably produced with a good hydrolysis activity under proper conditions.
https://teams.igem.org/3717	High School	Blood transfusions are an integral component of healthcare, but the availability of blood is limited by patient-donor blood type specificity. This leads to blood shortages worldwide, especially in developing countries and during times of pandemics or natural disasters, including the COVID-19 pandemic. To alleviate the blood shortage issue, this project aims to increase the supply of universal donor blood through the enzymatic conversion of A, B, and AB blood types to O type, eliminating patient donor incompatibility. We have identified 3 glycoside hydrolases that act as molecular scissors to cleave off terminal residues on A and B RBC surface antigens, preventing cells from eliciting an immune response. We propose a modular, two step blood conversion kit housing our recombinant enzymes that can be implemented into blood banks and processing centers, increasing access to universal donor blood for all.
https://teams.igem.org/3718	Village	Biological detection systems are not often associated with cell proliferation. Here, we propose a novel bacterial-based detection toolkit where the detection of the target substance will restore normal cell proliferation in genetically modified <i>E. Coli</i> with knocked out growth-related genes. When using the toolkit, a recombinant plasmid is first transformed into a wildtype <i>E. Coli</i> to knockout two genes, using the CRISPR-Cas9 system, to reduce its growth. After the knockout, another plasmid containing a modular receptor platform (MRP), genes that restore growth rates, and a multiple cloning site (MCS), are transformed. The MRP with a customizable receptor domain can bind to its operon to activate downstream genes after binding its ligand. Genes used to restore growth and a choice of the user would be expressed. We envision the detection toolkit to have various uses, such as the amplification of signals and the detection of diseases.
https://teams.igem.org/3719	Foundational Advance	To combat unwanted horizontal gene transfer in transgenic microbes, we are creating a multi-faceted biocontainment system designed to work in Escherichia coli. First, we use the GhoST toxin-antitoxin system to induce cell death in unintended recipients without the corresponding antitoxin. We are also designing a CRISPR-Cas9 based artificial immunity system to cleave conjugative plasmids that enter the host cell, preventing it from gaining conjugative machinery that would allow transfer of synthetic parts. In order to understand how our strategy would behave in a microbial community, we developed an assay to assess horizontal gene transfer from donor to recipient. We also use a Markovs model and an agent-based model (ABM) to imitate genetic transfer using biophysical and community-based methods, respectively. We hope this system could be used by future iGEM teams to enhance their biocontainment efforts and allow teams to move towards implementation in less controlled environments.
https://teams.igem.org/3720	Environment	Using genetic recombination technology, we will create E. coli bacteria that can detect toxic gases. The E. coli will be used in an environment where human life is at risk, and the luminescence of the E. coli will alert the user in advance of danger. In addition, we plan to make the E. coli die by itself after reacting for a while, assuming that the person handling the E. coli runs away at once in a dangerous situation. This is to prevent the worst-case scenario of accidentally releasing the synthetic organism into the environment. By using synthetic biology, we hope to create a multifunctional E. coli bacterium that can protect the safety of people in dangerous situations.
https://teams.igem.org/3721	Food & Nutrition	Our project is a modular solution for safe research and experimentation for genetically engineered organisms for application in agriculture. Our model implements a process that targets a pest and a crop on a case by case basis, and identifies ways to limit the organism within the required parameters. Our proof of concept tests stem borers and rice crops as our target pest-crop pair. We plan to use a natural endophyte of rice, Bacillus subtilis, to introduce anti-stem borer properties along with other additional benefits for the crop. The system is such that the toxin for controlling the stem borers is only expressed within the stem borer, and the endophyte will only survive within the plant and stem borer environments.
https://teams.igem.org/3722	Manufacturing	Tyrian purple is a natural dye that originally extracted from the secretion of sea snails in the ancient times, whose production cost thousands of snails and heavily relied on manpower. Nevertheless, there is not a method to prepare Tyrian purple in a large scale by now. Thus, we aim to realize the biosynthesis of 6,6-dibromoindigo, which is the main chemical constituent of Tyrian purple. The pathway begins from tryptophan and sodium bromide and end in 6,6-dibromoindigo, consisting of three successive reactions. To reduce the insolubility of the halogenase in the first reaction, we add a flavin reductase as a soluble tag on the N-terminal of the halogenase. Moreover, we get a tryptophanase knocked out strain by CRISPR/Cas9 to avoid the potential side reactions. Also we established a whole-cell reaction system to produce 6,6-dibromoindigo cheaply and efficiently. In addition, a dyeing protocol was developed to utilize our Tyrian purple products.
https://teams.igem.org/3723	WIKI	Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) persist in the environment and are associated with liver and kidney disease, altered immune function, lower birth weight, and cancer. More than 4,000 PFAS chemicals have been manufactured for industrial use. PFAS discharge seeps into ground water and bioaccumulates, resulting in unsafe human exposure. Responding to this urgent need, the US Air Force Academy iGEM team identified the aerobic bacterial species Delftia acidovorans from PFAS-contaminated soil with the potential ability to breakdown PFAS. Genetic sequencing of D. acidovorans revealed coding for 5 dehalogenase enzymes (DeHa 1-5). The dehalogenases genes were cloned individually into E. coli expression vectors. Assays of these purified enzymes revealed monodefluorination activity for DeHa 2 and 4. DeHa 1 and DeHa 5 show promising preliminary data and may prove capable of degrading perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). With further research and enzyme optimization, our enzymes could offer a powerful, inexpensive prospect for PFAS biodegradation.
https://teams.igem.org/3724	Diagnostics	The 2021 University of Rochester Team Bio-Spire is manufacturing a wearable biosensor to diagnose sepsis using biomarkers found in sweat. Sepsis is a condition caused by an overwhelming immune response to infection. In the USA alone, at least 1.7 million adults develop sepsis yearly and nearly 270,000 die. We are storing DNA-encoding aptamers for sepsis-related biomarkers in Escherichia coli, synthesizing them in vitro, and developing a sleeve-like biosensor that incorporates these aptamers, graphene, electrodes, and microfluidics to monitor the changing levels of relevant biomarkers in patients. Mathematical modeling is used to predict the concentrations of these biomarkers in blood based on the sweat samples, and a corresponding software tool will display warnings of the patients elevated sepsis risk. Our team is centering topics of safety, inclusivity, and ethics in our project, and we are doing outreach activities with a variety of local organizations to demonstrate basic scientific principles to children.
https://teams.igem.org/3725	High School	Hydroponics is a compact modular form of agriculture that addresses food insecurity by producing nutrient-dense, high-yield crops. However, maintaining small-scale systems introduces nutrient fluctuations thus declining plant health, impeding the implementation of hydroponics in urban communities. To combat these barriers and increase the frequency of hydroponics use, AgroSENSE provides an accurate and efficient method of nutrient monitoring and pathogen detection, while simultaneously addressing United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. We utilize our phosphate and nitrate biosensors and Fusarium and Phytophthora toehold switches in conjunction with our frugal plate reader for fluorescence quantification. To safely distribute our biosensors, we developed a frugal lyophilizer to freeze-dry cell-free lysates and bacterial samples. We collaborated with the Georgia Department of Agriculture on a regulatory proposal for agricultural biosensors to address biosecurity gaps and led community-centered synthetic biology educational outreach programs. AgroSENSE allows hydroponics users to proactively adjust system maintenance, ultimately increasing harvest yields and sustainability.
https://teams.igem.org/3726	Manufacturing	We will use cyanobacteria as living catalysts for light-driven direct carbon dioxide conversion to valuable products, upgrading the conventional biomass-based biorefineries. To do so, we will engineer the newly discovered Synechococcus PCC11801. A robust fast-growing cyanobacteria for direct sun to chemicals production. Our goal is to test the potential of photosynthetical chemical manufacturing producing n-butanol; an ideal biofuel and comodity chemical. We are implementing an artificial n-butanol biosynthetic pathway, an synthetic pathway for enhanced carbon fixation towards acetyl-CoA as central metabollite and genetic modifications for enhanced solvent tolerance. In addition we will explore cyanobacterial encapsulation in nano-structured biohybrid materials, while performing an insight into the requirements for the industrial scale-up of photobiocatalytic technology. Likewise, we will develop tools for easing cyanobacteria genetic engineering. We will develop a software for neutral integration sites identification. Also a recombination-based system for the easy generation of unmarked mutants will be developed.
https://teams.igem.org/3727	Diagnostics	Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most common type of pancreatic cancer and it is characterized by its devastating outcome, with only a 10% 5-year survival rate. As in other cancer types, it is considered that the earlier diagnosis could contribute to a more efficient treatment. However, the currently available diagnostic methods are unable to detect the tumor at an early stage. Thus, we are designing a toehold-based system to detect specific molecules, called miRNAs, that play an important role in the regulation of gene expression and cell cycle and are upregulated in the urine of patients in the first two stages of PDAC. We hope that this tool can be used by local diagnostic centers to provide a cost-effective, non-invasive and easily accessible diagnostic method. To further improve the impact of our method, we are, also, designing a device where the necessary reactions will take place.
https://teams.igem.org/3728	High School	Designer phage is a synthetic programmable bacteriophage utilized in diagnosis, vaccine, drug delivery in medicine. Salmonella spp. are a leading cause of food poisoning. Phage typing is a traditional method for characterizing distinct bacterial strains through specific recognition. Phage reporters have been genetically equipped with GFP or luciferase gene and applied in detecting Salmonella in contaminated food. However, the limitation and challenges still hinder its application to routine sample examination. In our project, we have created a Salmonella detector by introducing phi29 DNA polymerase gene into an isolated Salmonella phage genome through in vitro Tol2 transposon system. Rolling circle amplification (RCA) will be triggered in the presence of phi29 DNA polymerase generated by the reporter phage-infected Salmonella cells. The RCA products can be easily measured with a DNA-binding dye. Implementation in mathematical modeling and hardware design will help to understand the potential use in the real world.
https://teams.igem.org/3729	High School	From regulating calcium homeostasis, strengthening the immune system, and even preventing COVID-19 infection, vitamin D serves a crucial role in the maintenance of human health. Vitamin D deficiency, a global pandemic caused largely by the lack of sunlight exposure, has only exacerbated during COVID-19 lockdown. However, all current solutions to vitamin D deficiency present limitations in efficiency or accessibility. Our project presents a new method for vitamin D activation. By manipulating the acetyl-CoA butyrate producing pathway, we can increase the butyrate-producing ability of probiotics. The increased production of butyrate would upregulate Vitamin D receptor expression by increasing the activity of the TGF&#946; pathway, which would ultimately result in a more efficient activation of vitamin D. By introducing our engineered probiotics into fermented food starters, we believe the project could be implemented in daily diets, opening up opportunities for a more efficient way of vitamin D intake in the future.

We also enables engineered adenovirus to escape from immunity trap with immunocamouflage, which increases the titre of viral infection. We hoped that our project can give a new insight into precise oncolytic treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.

By means of Synthetic Biology, we hope to biosynthesize long-chain polyphosphate, which is biocompatible and promising to cure IBD. The aim of our project is to develop a new application of long-chain polyphosphate, including not only biosynthesizing it with high yield and under the concept of sustainable development, but also exploring its potential to be developed as a new IBD therapy.
https://teams.igem.org/3732	New Application	This year, our team developed a system of aroma production by light-regulated microorganisms, which gives microorganisms the ability to produce aroma by regulating endogenous pathways and cutting into different exogenous enzymes, and through mathematical modeling, determine its optimal culture conditions so that it stably exists in the developed system. By adding light-controlled switch elements to microorganisms, the concentration of the aroma can be changed according to the intensity of light. The inhibition of linalool synthase in Escherichia coli is relieved under light, and linalool can be produced. Saccharomyces cerevisiae can produce nerol in dark conditions, and the related proteins are eventually degraded under the light. Finally, we designed an ingenious hardware device for the whole system, which effectively solved the problem of microbial leakage and aroma diffusion. Looking to the future, our team hopes to apply the system to the development of new nightlights and into people's lives.
https://teams.igem.org/3733	Diagnostics	Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), whose victim almost covers all mammalian species, is an immune-mediated disease at the intersection of complex interactions among genetics, environment and gut microbiota. Compared with human-beings, pets are not able to voice their current health conditions directly; thus, delayed diagnosis becomes a common phenomenon. Taking the most common pets- dogs as objects, HZAU-China aims to develop a method based on synthetic biology to detect IBD at an early stage. The modified Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 can sense the concentration change of biomarkers. If pets suffer from IBD, the bacteria will amplify the unperceivable pathological change by producing substance with special smell and release therapeutic protein. Whatever pets' health conditions are, the modified bacteria will release health-care unit, exerting profound positive effects on pets' health. In the future, our project will be further ameliorated so as to apply this detective method to a wider range of mammals.
https://teams.igem.org/3734	Therapeutics	Our project aims to find a new method of treating type 1 diabetes with the help of synthetic biology. Our engineered cells will be implanted subcutaneously by mature embedding technology.When the cells meet two conditions , hyperglycemia and shinning blue light, they are able to secrete insulin and make the levels ofblood sugar become lower until it gets back to normal level. However, when the level of insulin is high&#65292;Insulin molecule will be combined with insulin receptor and the signal would be activated by it. Then, miRNA will be expressed and inhibit the expression of insulin. Meanwhile, because of Tet-off system, we can use tetracycline to force the loop to stop, in order to improve the safety of our design.
https://teams.igem.org/3735	Environment	Selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) are a kind of elemental selenium wrapped in biological macromolecules such as proteins. Some microorganisms have the nutural ability to reduce selenium-oxide anions to SeNPs. However, they are not always perfect. There are problems such as low reduction efficiency and low activity due to large particle size of SeNPs. We chose E.coli BL21, which has the natural ability of reducing selenium oxide anions to SeNPs, as the chassis, added ssuE enzyme and Sef A protein which could improve the reduction rate. Finally, a high-efficient selenium recovery bioreactor with higher reduction rate and higher product activity was obtained. The SeNPs produced in the bioreactor has been used to inhibit drug-resistant bacteria, adsorb heavy metal ions and improve the quality of crops with satisfactory results.
https://teams.igem.org/3736	Therapeutics	Periodontal disease is an infection of the tissues that hold your teeth in place. Severe periodontal disease was proved to be related to many chronic and cardiovascular diseases. With almost 10% of the global population affected with periodontal disease, the problem of oral disease has been one of the top problems that pose a threat to human beings and even dogs. As many experimenting thoughts are first conducted on dogs, we think it's expedient to focus on dogs' oral health first before applying to human beings. We ameliorate and create a new type of dental bone, DenTeeth.In DenTeeth, antimicrobial peptides are used to sterilize. And we also found several proteins which can repair damaged gingiva and tooth tissue. By optimizing our design through this procedure, we can adjust our project to the optimal place.
https://teams.igem.org/3737	Environment	The Pine River is found in central Michigan, near Alma College's campus. Following the closure of the Velsicol Chemical Plant in 1978, many environmental pollutants -- including DDT and its derivatives -- were improperly disposed of and leached into the surroundings, thus coining the name, the Poisoned River. These organochlorides are endocrine disruptors and possible carcinogens have wreaked havoc on the local ecosystem. More than this population were affected. Our solution: a biosensor that uses estrogen receptors to detect these harmful pollutants. Several species of animals have estrogen receptors known to bind DDT, a known xenoestrogen. Linking this to a reporting gene, such as RFP, within a microbe will allow the detection of organochlorides. This can lead to the screening of contaminated areas locally and globally. Ultimately, this biosensor has the potential to save thousands of dollars in not only our superfund sites, but pollution cleanup effort across the globe.

https://teams.igem.org/3739	New Application	Nuclear power is an important source in electricity production. The plants need to be built on coast for the huge requirement of cooling water. However, marine organisms such as Phaeocystis globosa and Mytilus eduli sometimes cause blockage, making the cooling water system less efficient. Here, we show our solutions that the Lectin-SpyTag/SpyCatcher can pull down P. globosa colonies and then the hutH-fused proteins suppress the activity of P. globosa. To inhibit M. eduli fouling, Vibrio natriegens are engineered to express LC1KR2, PPO, and TnaA, which function jointly to attach engineered bacteria to the coarse grille and to inhibit M. eduli attachment. Genes rhlA and rhlB are also introduced to remove protection from mussel foot protein(mfp). As for biosafety, a blue-light-activated device, pBlind system, is implemented to control the expression of toxic protein BlrA, which can constrain the engineered bacteria in a reservoir with two blue light strips upstream and downstream.
https://teams.igem.org/3740	Therapeutics	Infection remains the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in burn patients. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is among the leading causes of nosocomial infection primarily because it is intrinsically resistant to many antibiotics and antimicrobials. This year our team is working on P.aeruginosa infection and wound repair in burn treatment. Using principles of synthetic biology, we genetically modified Gluconacetobacter hansenii ATCC 53582 to kill P. aeruginosa specifically through the production and release of chimeric bacteriocin SE protein and the immunity protein. Moreover, the production of cellulose in the engineered Gluconacetobacter hansenii ATCC 53582 was regulated by light, which can further prevent infection of other bacteria and promote wound repair.

Among the many problems of space migration, our team has great interest in space food. We tried to provide feasible solutions based on synthetic biology and tissue engineering technology. In our design, firstly, an engineered E. coli was employed and started with glucose as raw material to synthesize a bio-compatible polymer, which would work as scaffold for muscle cell growth. Afterwards, collagen was produced by another engineered E. coli and doped with scaffold materials. Then the scaffold was prepared by biological 3D printing technology. Finally, the extracted muscle stem cells were inoculated on the scaffold for culture, differentiation, and proliferation to form the final cultured meat. Besides, a mathematical model is established to simulate the growth of artificial meat, which would provide foundation and guidance for the future research.
https://teams.igem.org/3743	Therapeutics	Immunotherapy provides new therapeutic opportunities for various cancers and infectious diseases. Herein, triple-negative breast cancer immunotherapy is achieved via circuits developed to operate logical decisions upon recognizing intracellular targets. Using DNA launching of replicons as a potent delivery system, the platform regulates the expression of the subgenomic immunotherapeutic message based on sensing intracellular mRNAs or proteins via novel protein fusion constructs. This regulation depends on a set of riboswitches to control downstream expression. To provide a safety switch for clinical applications, the system can be stopped through a small molecule inhibition. This design is also environment-responsive, as it depends on a set of toehold-like switches to sense cell-specific set of RNAs leading to feedback regulation of the delivered cargo. The platform was adapted to deliver intratumoral oncolytic and immunotherapeutic signals. It is aided by a set of deep learning models and a computational directed evolution algorithm for developing functional proteins.
https://teams.igem.org/3744	Diagnostics	Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the most prevalent form of oral cancer. Since medical infrastructure is unaffordable to most of our society, an urgent and effective diagnostic tool is needed at present. Our kit, OSCCit aims at detecting the levels of salivary protease biomarkers that are elevated among OSCC patients. It then assesses the risk one has of developing OSCC and might suggest the user to visit a doctor. OSCCit contains an engineered bacterial cage protein - Encapsulin that has fluorophores internally and a substrate sequence externally. When protease biomarkers cleave the latter, fluorescence occurs. This characteristic emission frequency allows us to verify the presence of the protease and estimate its concentration through the emission intensity. Protease biomarkers maintain their activity, giving us the advantage of working directly with a patients saliva without any processing. Additionally, 3D printed hardware parts ensure the kit can be used with a smartphone.
https://teams.igem.org/3745	WIKI	Rhamnolipid, a widely used biosurfactant, is produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but the overall production cannot fulfill the demand of industrial use. BNDS China 2021 aims to increase rhamnolipids production using directed evolution and protein scaffold. For the convenience of genetic engineering, rhlA, B, and C which are endogenous enzymes in P.a. are transformed into E. coli. With the EvolvR directed evolution system, random mutations can be added to the gene and variants with higher activity can be screened with a rhamnose induced promoter fused with antibiotic resistance genes and the rhamnolipidases that can hydrolyze rhamnolipid into rhamnose. Protein scaffold, which can fuse the separate enzymes into a complex, is also included in our design in order to reduce the shunt product and increase the yield. Two Mathematical models are designed to quantyitatively validate our biosensor for EvolvR system,and to increase the activity of the enzyme by point mutation.
https://teams.igem.org/3746	Village	Aflatoxins are carcinogens produced by Aspergillus sp. Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is the most common and toxic member among all. According to WHO, ~25% of foods crops are contaminated by AFB annually. Meanwhile, ~5 billion people are at risk of AFB exposure and 80% of them develop AFB-related cancer. The Consumer Council of Hong Kong in 2020 shows that 24% of popular dried spices in HK contain AFB. Meanwhile, the humid weather in HK favors the growth of the fungi, so AFB contamination of improperly stored food is a common problem. Our project aims to synthesize a probiotic E. coli that secretes high activity AFB-degrading enzymes. The applications include: 1. Applying to the surface of crops. While the enzymes detoxify the AFB, E. coli reduces the fungal growth by competition. 2. Purified enzymes will be used as detoxifying spray. This project is in the Phase I stage.
https://teams.igem.org/3747	Environment	Our planet suffers from a large excess of reactive nitrogen, impacting local and global ecosystems. In the Netherlands, almost 50% of total nitrogen emissions originate from the cattle industry, mainly in the form of ammonia. Additionally, cattle naturally emit the potent greenhouse gas methane, contributing to global warming. Experts informed us that currently, no combined solution exists to both threats. Therefore we have developed Cattlelyst, a biofilter for cattle stalls targeting ammonia and methane emissions. Cattlelyst relies upon a synthetic co-culture of two non-pathogenic bacterial species that remove these harmful gasses. We modelled and established ammonia conversion in Pseudomonas putida alongside engineering Escherichia coli to consume methane. Containment of the bacteria in the biofilter is ensured by a combination of auxotrophy and two safety circuits. Thanks to these features, Cattlelyst provides a biological, animal-friendly and biosafe solution to reduce the ecological hoofprint of the livestock sector.
https://teams.igem.org/3748	WIKI	The Netherlands is producing excess nitrogen, which is harmful to nature and biodiversity. One of the main culprits for this so-called nitrogen crisis is animal agriculture, a vital income source for the Dutch economy. Our project targets ammonia emissions contributing to the crisis and aims to convert them into a beneficial feed additive. Thus, we have engineered Saccharomyces spp. to synthesize alpha-amylase, an enzyme that optimizes cattles digestion. This way, their milk production and growth will be enhanced while ammonia emissions will be reduced simultaneously. Residual ammonia will be captured by a state-of-the-art filter device, a Metal-Organic Framework (MOF), and fed back to our GMO. Furthermore, insights from artificial intelligence will be employed to optimize the engineering process. Overall, we have designed a closed sustainable circle in which waste - excess ammonia, is converted into worth - a feed additive for cattle.

https://teams.igem.org/3750	Village	The Great Barrier Reef is the worlds largest coral system, integral to Indigenous Australian culture and classified as a World Heritage Site. Rising ocean temperatures have caused several large coral bleaching events, which are attributed to a shift in the symbiotic relationship between coral and microscopic algae species. Heat-induced oxidative stress experienced by algae eventually leads to their expulsion from coral. PROTECC Coral, a Phase II project, aims to reduce coral bleaching by increasing the thermotolerance and antioxidant capacity of a common algal symbiont Symbiodinium goreaui. The twofold solution involves introducing small heat shock proteins to prevent protein aggregation, and a glutathione recycling enzyme system to counteract oxidative stress. Experiments and computational modelling were conducted to examine and validate the solution, complemented by considerable outreach, both informing the wider population about synthetic biology and consulting with various stakeholders, including Traditional Owners, to assess the value and impact of the project.

https://teams.igem.org/3752	Diagnostics	<i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> are a highly widespread family of bacteria, some of which are pathogenic. They are traditionally treated with antibiotics, but the antibiotic resistance crisis threatens to remove this option. Some <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> have developed resistance to carbapenems, a "last-resort" antibiotic for multi-drug resistant bacteria. Hence, containment is one of the most effective countermeasures against infections with carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE). However, current methods of testing for CPE are slow and can take up to 4 days for a negative result. Hospitals appear to be a reservoir for CPE  particularly drains, sinks and faucets. To aid in containing the spread of CPE, we propose a novel detection method using a gRNA modified into a riboswitch, sensitive to the presence of a carbapenemase mRNA, coupled with a CRISPR activation system to produce a fluorescent green RNA aptamer. The resulting fluorescence can be viewed under UV light, making carbapenem resistant bacteria easy to identify.

We get inspiration from mussels, a creature that can adhere tightly to reefs through mussel protein in aqueous environment, and we designed a new biocompatible osteogenic glue. We designed adhesion, hydrogel, regulation and drug systems to make it a qualified osteogenic material. The adhesion system is based on mussel protein, which provides the adhesive ability in aqueous environment. The hydrogel system is designed to provide structural strength and UV-induced mechanism makes it friendly to clinicians. The regulation system is based on cells, we construct a Piezo1-based pathway to make cells sense the stress during the bone growth and secret enzymes to degrade the hydrogel, and then drugs mixed in the gel are released. We name it MIBOM, Mussel Inspired Biocompatible Osteogenic Material.
https://teams.igem.org/3756	New Application	Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease estimated to affect more than 339 million people worldwide. People suffering from asthma can only use different levels of ICS or ICS-LABA to prevent exacerbations and control symptoms. We focus on type 2 inflammation in bronchus, which is common but a key contributor to asthma. Our scheme is to take advantage of RNAi therapy to target TSLP and GATA3 to degrade their expression of mRNA and consequently improve asthma situations. During this process, we use a self-assembled siRNA delivery system where we enclose the siRNAs with exosomes to inhibit the above genes' translation and to subsequently prevent downstream toxicity and immunogenicity, which is superior to the otherwise exogenously pre-assembled systems. Meanwhile, we connected with our community through human practices to raise awareness of asthma. To ensure our sustainable impact, we held a regional meetup and founded an organization called the Nanjing iGEM Association (NIA).
https://teams.igem.org/3757	Therapeutics	Antimicrobial resistance is one of the ten most severe global health threats to humanity, according to the WHO. Pathogenic bacteria are constantly acquiring resistance to further antibiotics, leading to the emergence of multi-drug-resistant and therefore untreatable strains with the drugs available. A class of new potential antibacterial drugs are antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), which are part of the innate immune response of eukaryotes and prokaryotes. However, the medical applicability of unmodified AMPs is limited by their low in vivo stability. Therefore, we invented ATHELAS: an AMP-thioknot herbal expression and low effort activity screening platform. In our project, we use highly stable cyclic peptides from plants called cyclotides as a scaffold to stabilize AMPs. We developed a convenient platform to screen the properties of arbitrary stabilized peptides. Our platform includes an array of fast cloning, transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana, efficient extraction and purification, and antibacterial activity testing.
https://teams.igem.org/3758	Foundational Advance	Climate change is threatening many of the crops we rely on. To ensure stable food supply, engineered crops will play a major role in our future agriculture, but crop development currently takes about a decade. In our project OpenPlast, we develop cell free systems (CFS) from chloroplasts of different plants, including various crops. Showing that they can be employed as prototyping platforms to characterize genetic constructs, these systems drastically reduce testing times. We use a machine learning guided approach to optimize reaction mixture composition and create a collection of GoldenGate based chloroplast parts to be characterized in our CFS. This toolbox includes regulatory elements for chloroplasts of plants so far heavily underrepresented in the registry. After successful chloroplast transformation, we want to show that data generated in our systems is comparable to in vivo data, proving that our systems can efficiently be used as prototyping platforms for plant SynBio.
https://teams.igem.org/3759	High School	Plastics are widely used in the world because of its durability. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is one of the most commonly used plastics. Generally, there are 3 methods for PET recycling including physical, chemical, and biological recycling. However, physical and chemical recycling both have limitations,such as the inability to achieve closed-loop recycling and cause secondary pollution. Therefore, biological recycling seems to be a sustainable development approach. Research published on Nature found a mutant LCC (mLCC) which is the most efficient enzyme that can degrade PET. Base on the facts, our group decides to enhance the activity of mLCC by proceeding two approaches, The first is constructing a fusion protein of mLCC and hydrophobins to enhance PET adsorption. The second is using the technique of Bacillus subtilis cell surface display to construct a whole-cell biocatalyst which can improve the stability of enzymes and reduce costs.
https://teams.igem.org/3760	Therapeutics	Currently, the world is still faced with the COVID-19 pandemic caused by novel coronavirus(SARS-CoV-2) which urgently requires flexible and targeted protection measures. The spike protein on its surface binds to receptors called ACE2 and then enters the cell through endocytosis. Inhibiting the expression level of ACE2 is considered to be an effective treatment for COVID-19. CRISPR-Cas13d is an RNA-guided ribonuclease that targets ssRNA. The design of gRNA does not need to consider specific adjacent motif. We select human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293T) to establish ACE2 stable transfection lines and lentivirus with novel coronavirus spike protein is used as pseudovirus. Through bioinformatics screening of crRNA pool for ACE2 conserved sequence, the lentivirus /CRISPR-Cas13d system was constructed. The system is designed to knock down the mRNA of ACE2 in cells, which leads to a decrease of ACE2 on cell surface. Thus, entry of the pseudovirus into cells is inhibited.

https://teams.igem.org/3762	Environment	With SulFind, we are addressing acute fish death caused by hydrogen sulfide (H2S) poisoning in recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS). Our goal is to design a biosensor that would satisfy industry standards as present technologies for H2S detection are often insufficiently sensitive for toxic H2S levels. Two biosensor systems were attempted, a whole-cell system and a system based on heme proteins. Our heme-based sensor exploits the protein's sulfide-binding capabilities. We use fluorescence intensity to evaluate the conformational change in fluorophore-tagged myoglobin protein bound to H2S. The sensing device will be embedded in a microfluidic chip, which will be compatible with existing methods for monitoring water quality in RAS facilities. As a result, our study seeks to reduce acute fish mortality in RAS facilities, making RAS more sustainable and economical.
https://teams.igem.org/3763	Therapeutics	Acne, a common skin disease generally related to pores being blocked by sebum and Propionibacterium acnes proliferating in such an anaerobic environment, almost bothers everyone but has no particularly effective treatment. To address this long-standing challenge, our project aims to develop a novel acne therapy. We engineered a safe, nutritionally deficient Escherichia coli strain, which could decompose fatty acids in high efficiency and secrete strain-specific bacteriocin, for ameliorating sebum blocking and inhibiting P.acnes growth, respectively. In addition, a fatty acids-sensing system was constructed to enable precise therapeutics actuation only in appropriate conditions, minimizing the side effects of gene leakage expression. Furthermore, a high-throughput microfluidic chip was manufactured for accelerating the experimental cycle of directed evolution to optimize the fatty acids-sensing system. It is anticipated that the Acneraser will build new bridges between acne research and synthetic biology, letting this promising and exciting scientific field enhance everyone's life.
https://teams.igem.org/3764	Environment	Our team focused on the application of protocols, combining identification of already known and discovery of new genetic determinants, for antibiotic resistance in waste waters. In Phase 1, we gathered information for known antibiotic resistance genes by running full metagenomic sequencing, as well as through selective amplification and sequencing of integrons. This allowed early detection of antibiotic resistance factors relevant to clinically significant antibiotics. Then we singled out genes related to antibiotic resistance, which havent been found in the territory of Bulgaria yet. Upon the discovery of new determinants, our project entered Phase 2, in which the determinants were generated using synthesis and gene cloning. The successful completion of our project would lead to the development of streamlined protocols for the examination of the cumulative resistome. This allows for an adequate estimation of antibiotic resistance and provide us with information for future emergence and treatment of multi-resistant bacteria.
https://teams.igem.org/3765	Environment	Project CellOPHane seeks to create a functionalized bacterial cellulose filter to combat organophosphate pollution. Organophosphates are used as pesticides globally but are extremely potent neurotoxic agents, which cause adverse reactions on reaching living organisms through contaminated agricultural runoff. We are seeking to degrade the organophosphates present in water into relatively harmless products by using a broad-spectrum organophosphate hydrolase functionalized on a bacterial cellulose sheet. We're also seeking to create a one-of-a-kind modular plug-n-play platform to combat other kinds of pollution with minimal modifications. The platform that we seek to create can be used for any bioremediation strategy by just cloning the corresponding enzyme; one need not therefore spend resources on reimagining the exact design implementation for every individual contaminant. Project CellOPHane will thus help in reshaping the bioremediation landscape and make bioremediation strategies easy to develop and implement.
https://teams.igem.org/3766	Foundational Advance	Every life form has emerged through evolution. Successive random mutations followed by selection of the fittest individuals has resulted in vastly complex and diverse living organisms. This process can be accelerated in the laboratory to create new protein variants with desirable properties by diversification of a known DNA sequence followed by selective amplification, an approach known as directed evolution. In vivo diversification with locus-specific targeting has recently become possible using T7-RNAP-guided deaminases. Here, aiming to maximize the effectiveness of this method, we have combined two strategies. First, we use new cytosine and adenosine deaminases with improved mutagenesis rates. Second, our innovative design can target both DNA strands simultaneously, resulting in improved diversification and reducing the bias observed in existing systems that mainly target only one of the strands of DNA in each mutation cycle. Finally, we validate the performance of our system by evolving enzymes, fluorescent proteins and transcription factors.

https://teams.igem.org/3768	Foundational Advance	The AstroYeast Microfarm project comprises two major parts. These include AstroYeast, which is a strain of microgravity tolerant S. cerevisiae and a bioreactor that mitigates the effect of microgravity on liquid cultures. The overall goal of this project is to provide a platform for bioproduction using bakers yeast that can be used on long space missions. To develop the yeast, a fluorescent reporter whose expression mimics microgravity induced stress responses, and will be used as a marker for tracking evolution progress. The promoters selected are based on results from the AstroBio database, our teams project from last year. Microgravity stress was induced using microgravity simulators in the form of a high aspect rotating vessel and a 3D clinostat designed and built by our team and collaborators. The bioreactor will be designed to be automated, sustainable, and accessible to the operator in order to satisfy our objective.
https://teams.igem.org/3769	Therapeutics	Depression is a common but serious mood disorder. Although there are treatments for depression, the possible adverse effects associated with antidepressant medication and the decline of treatments from patients can be problematic. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), as an important inhibitory neurotransmitter, has been shown to play a significant role in the regulation of mood disorders. Studies show that in healthy individuals, GABA-producing pathways are actively expressed in human gut microbiota. Based on these findings, we aim to engineer a dynamically controlled gut bacteria which can synthesize GABA to alleviate depression. We engineer a strain of E. coli to contain an optogenetic switch. When the switch is on, GadB (enzyme) and &#966;X174E (lysis protein) can be made. GadB can catalyze the conversion of glutamate (which is abundant in foods) into GABA inside the cell. After the GABA concentration reaches a threshold, &#966;X174E can lyse the cell and release GABA into the environment.

https://teams.igem.org/3771	Food & Nutrition	Mental health disorders, especially chronic stress-induced depression (CSID), have heavily impacted the lives of many. During the COVID-19 pandemic, humanity has been under more irregularity, and currently, 25% of the global population is highly stressed out. To alleviate mental dysregulations caused by aggregating stress, iGEM NCKU_Tainan invented MenTAUR, a revolutionary solution to CSID. MenTAUR consists of two components: Menbles and f(int). Menbles are edible Taiwanese bubbles containing E. coli Nissle 1917 that can autoregulate the production of taurine, a well-known neuroprotective agent, in the intestine by sensing the reactive oxygen species (ROS) and interferon-gamma (IFN-&#947;), which are of higher levels in stressed-induced depressive patients. f(int) is a microfluidic chip that simulates the intestinal environment where the auto-production of taurine occurs, allowing us to model the metabolism of Menbles. iGEM NCKU_Tainan believes that MenTAUR, as your lifes mentor, serves as guidance on your journey to a stress-free world.
https://teams.igem.org/3772	Manufacturing	In the humid south, mosquito repellent has been the concern of Guangzhou people. Mosquitoes are not only annoying but also spread various diseases. Therefore, in tropical and subtropical areas, mosquito repellant products are in great demand. Nootkatone is a new mosquito repellent ingredient reported by EPA with more safety and higher stability, but excessively high cost has caused manufacturing limitations. SCUT-China aims at turning S. cerevisiae into a cell factory for Nootkatone production and improving efficiency by promoter engineering modification. Based on the fermentation characteristics of S. cerevisiae, we combined the upstream regulatory elements of different promoters according to the carbon source response mechanism of promoters, and obtained hybrid-promoter supporting high expression in both early and late fermentation. Further, we increased the transcriptional strength of hybrid-promoters by nucleosome affinity model. It is hoped that this project could help achieve higher market shares of Nootkatone and benefit more people.
https://teams.igem.org/3773	Village	Orthogonality, defined as the lack of unwanted interactions among parts of a circuit or between a circuit and host physiology, is a fundamental tenet of synthetic biology. While methodology for identifying undesirable interactions among circuit parts themselves is well studied, assessment of orthogonality between the circuit and the host physiology that goes beyond metabolic burden has received surprisingly little attention, with the few existing methods both costly and technically challenging. To address this universal need, W&M iGEM is developing an accessible toolkit for circuit-host orthogonality assessment in E. coli. This toolkit employs circuits that provide measurements not only of classic burden, but also more encompassing orthogonality markers identified by extensive analysis of RNA-Seq data. These measurements serve as inputs for our integrative, comprehensive mathematical model that provides the end user with overall orthogonality metrics, with the goal of enhancing the efficiency, functionality, and safety of all synthetic biology circuits.
https://teams.igem.org/3774	Foundational Advance	In the last few years,&#8239;DNA&#8239;sequencing has developed rapidly while DNA synthesis still relies on the decades-old&#8239;chemical phosphoramidite system. However, this process is toxic and has already reached its limit at around 200 bases. Thus, the demand for more environmentally friendly and effective novel approaches is evident. In this project, we report an enzymatic ssDNA synthesis system with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT). In each synthesis cycle, an unspecific number of nucleotides is incorporated. Our unique automated hardware can selectively attach nucleotides to immobilized primers in order to synthesize preset DNA sequences. We present a ternary system to encode and recover the information stored on DNA. This system enables the semi-specific approach, in which information is saved only in the transitions between bases, therefore specific synthesis is not necessary. This opens up a much more approachable and robust system that even allows adding proof-reading properties.
https://teams.igem.org/3775	Environment	Globally, close to 80% of wastewater receives no treatment and it is anticipated that 40% of people will lack access to clean water for drinking or irrigation by 2030. Additionally, given the effects of climate change on the planet, sustainable, carbon neutral fuels are essential to mitigate anthropogenic damage to the planet. SDSU's iGEM team addressed these issues using a three chamber Bioelectrochemical System(BES) inoculated with Shewanella oneidensis in the anode chamber and Methanococcus maripaludis in the cathode. The third chamber is used for water deionization by taking advantage of the BES cell voltage and permeable membranes. Although the BES desalinates, treats organics in wastewater, and creates a biofuel(CH4) from CO2 using the wild type organisms, reactive oxygen species(ROS) genes, protein folding chaperones, and a methane monooxygenase(MMO) were constructed to allow M. maripaludis to synthesize methanol from methane within the BES.
https://teams.igem.org/3776	High School	Lactams are family of cyclic amides widely used in the synthesis materials including nylon and piperidines used in drugs. Traditionally, lactams are synthesized through energy-intensive petrochemical methods. Here, we describe a method using Synechococcus elongatus UTEX 2973 as a chassis for the production of &#948;-valerolactam. A feedback insensitive aspartate kinase (AK) is used to achieve overproduction of lysine. Lysine is then oxidized to &#948;-amino-valeramide by L-Lysine monooxygenase (DavB), which is further hydrolyzed to &#948;-aminovalerate (5-AVA) by 5-aminovaleramide amidohydrolase (DavA). The resulting 5-AVA is cyclized to form &#948;-valerolactam. A shuttle vector with the feedback insensitive AK, davB and davA is integrated to S.elongatus UTEX 2973 through the INTEGRATE system, a previously described CRISPR-transposon system. Since reported cyclases for the cyclization of 5-AVA to &#948;-valerolactam are not efficient, an efficient cyclase is also designed using computational analysis.

Therefore, this project aims to design a series of whole cell biosensors (WCBs) to detect three kinds of common antibiotics.. To break through the common limitations of WCBs, a fluorescent RNA aptamer is used as the output signal to increase the response speed, and it is hoped that the signal-noise ratio and dynamic range of the sensor can be improved by the NIMPLY logic gate gene circuit composed of CRISPRi and strand replacement reactions.
https://teams.igem.org/3778	Therapeutics	Antibiotic-resistant bacteria, such as Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), are an emerging threat to global health and development. MRSA infects victims through open wounds and remains latent in macrophages. The infected MRSA is efficiently beat by the healthy immune system but causes bacteremia and endocarditis in patients with weak immunity. Here, we generate an antimicrobial dressing, namely AgenT, to prevent MRSA infection through open wounds on patients with weak immunity. AgenT Dressing is composed of an outer physical defense Polyurethane layer, an absorptive middle layer composed of alginate and chitosan, and an antimicrobial collagen layer with antimicrobial peptides and cell-penetrating peptides to target both intracellular and extracellular MRSA infections. We believe that AgenT will be a new treatment option to stop MRSA infections before it becomes worse. Fight MRSA with Mr. Superbug Assassin!

The aim of the project is to improve the life cell imaging method by using the protein within HeLa-cells. Furthermore, we like to express and isolate the protein in Escherichia coli to dissolve the protein into a liquid. In this context we want to find out if the absorbance properties are independent of the DNA protection function. The developed liquid could be used to protect other surfaces.
https://teams.igem.org/3781	Village	Large quantities of protein are needed every year for research and medical purposes. Production of heterologous proteins in genetically modified microbial hosts has long been established as a biotechnological standard. Still, the production of proteins destined for therapeutic application in humans, often proves to be challenging for conventional host organisms due to complex post-translational modifications most mammalian proteins undergo. Specific modification patterns, such as human-like glycosylation, cannot be replicated in microbial expression hosts, yet are essential to the protein´s functionality. Recently, the protozoan parasite Leishmania tarentolae has emerged as a favorable eukaryotic expression host because of its human-like glycosylation capabilities. To facilitate the use of Leishmania tarentolae, we established a library of genetic parts suitable for the usage of the Modular Cloning system within Leishmania tarentolae. This paves the way to a versatile and expandable gene part collection, making the expression of human-like glycosylated proteins more feasible and effective.
https://teams.igem.org/3782	Food & Nutrition	Late spring freezes cause frost damage in plants, which results in important crop losses, notably for apricots in the Swiss region Valais. When the temperatures drop below zero, ice crystals form and destroy sensitive plant tissues. This problem is exacerbated by Pseudomonas syringae syringae, a common pathogen of apricot trees producing an ice-nucleation protein that promotes ice crystal formation. Our project aims to find biological treatments to protect apricot trees from frost damage. We pursue three different combinable approaches. Firstly, we engineer Escherichia coli to overproduce antifreeze proteins, which we purify and spray onto the plants, so that they bind to ice crystals and inhibit their growth. Secondly, we also produce tailocins, bactericidal protein complexes, to specifically kill P. syringae. Lastly, we want to use a phage that delivers CRISPR/Cas9 and a guide RNA into P. syringae on the plants to delete the gene coding for the ice nucleating protein.
https://teams.igem.org/3783	Therapeutics	Sepsis is caused by the overreaction of the immune system to an infection. This overreaction can starve organs of oxygen leading to tissue death, organ failure, and even death. Approximately 1 in 5 deaths worldwide are sepsis-related. When sepsis is caused by a bacterial infection, the immune system reacts to an endotoxin, lipid-A. Our solution was a phage that can kill bacteria and release molecules that competitively inhibit or modify lipid A such that the immune response is reduced. We designed recombinant plasmids with multiple promoters and different anti-lipid A genes to be inserted into the phage genome. Beyond the lab, we created a predictive model for baseline gene expression to compare promoter strengths. Additionally, we worked to propose legislation promoting phage therapy and spread awareness about sepsis by creating a childrens book.
https://teams.igem.org/3784	Therapeutics	Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major chronic disease with high incidence, poor prognosis and complicated complications, which has become a major public health problem endangering global public health. Indoxyl sulfate is the key urotoxin that promotes the progression of chronic kidney disease, and its precursor, Indole, is formed by tryptophan metabolized by the E.coil, then is metabolized by hepatocytes and eventually produce it. This year, we are committed to using engineered bacteria for special therapy in the following three ways: Firstly, we prevent our chassis metabolism from producing indole and enhance the competitive advantage of the chassis; Secondly, we use engineered bacteria to convert tryptophan into indole propionic acid, a substance conducive to enhancing intestinal mucosal barrier. In addition, we use engineered bacteria to promote the growth of other probiotics and improve the ecology of intestinal flora. Through the above ways, we believe that CKD will be well treated.
https://teams.igem.org/3785	Foundational Advance	Based on the study of our team PI, We designed a DNA double-loop structure with hairpin, APP sequence, promoter sequence and ribozyme gene. By adding inducer, the conformation of DNA changed and ribozyme gene expressed normally. We plan to use this switch to simulate the effects of special structures such as left spiral DNA and cross structure on gene expression in organisms, and it can be applied to detect whether cobalt ions, nickel ions and ZBP1 protein are contained in the environment. In further studies we also focus on diseases caused by DNA conformational changes, like Alzheimers Disease and Breast Cancer, seeking a way of detection of these diseases and an easy and quick method to show the diagnosing results.
https://teams.igem.org/3786	Village	Biosafety is central when manipulating GMOs. We aim to participate in increasing biosafety by using minicells, nanosized and chromosome-free bacterial cells formed by abnormal division of rod-shaped bacteria. We observed their behaviour and hypothesized their use as chassis for local production of desired proteins, without purification expenses. This project is centered around the production of compounds through minicells of E.coli MG1655 containing a plasmid of interest. Minicells are produced using two approaches: overexpression of the FtsZ ring and deletion of the min operon. In parallel, a bioreactor for cultivation and isolation of minicells from parental cells was designed to guarantee a final genomic DNA-free sample. Filtration and introduction of an infection-defective lambda phage into the genome of parental cells was implemented to achieve higher separation yield. We focused the project on production of indigo pigment and found a method to safely dye textile without purification or addition of chemicals.
https://teams.igem.org/3787	High School	Plastic pollution has been a global issue since the last century. In this study, we provide solutions to alleviate the plastic pollution problem from multiple perspectives. We developed a dual enzyme system as chimeras between PETase and MHETase to degrade polyethylene terephthalate (PET) into its constituent monomers. The performance of PETase and MHETase cocktail mixtures is also compared for the extent of hydrolysis of amorphous PET film, and the mixture exhibits improved depolymerization activity compared with the single enzyme. A survey of 60 items, aimed to investigate knowledge, values and actions of secondary students towards plastic pollution, was designed and conducted in 4 secondary schools. The findings suggest the need for environmental education to engage students to take part in preserving the natural environment. Drone and AI technology was applied to train and develop a deep learning PET bottle detection model, which maps plastic pollution on beaches.
https://teams.igem.org/3788	Environment	Arboviral diseases, such as Zika, Dengue and Chikungunia are a serious threat to human health as no vaccines against them exist. Furthermore, global warming is causing the spread of the mosquito vectors of these diseases, including to the South of France. However, mosquitos are an important element of biodiversity in the environment and part of ecosystem food chains. We have designed and engineered ARBO-BLOCK, an innovative, and eco-friendly solution to prevent arboviral diseases spread. Using a modified bacterium from the mosquito microbiota to specifically detect and kill only dangerous virus-infected mosquitoes, while preserving uninfected mosquitoes. ARBO-BLOCK is designed around a timed lysis device, that results in bacterial lysis and release of large amounts of arthropod lethal toxins accumulated following the detection of viruses in the mosquito gut.
https://teams.igem.org/3789	Food & Nutrition	Gout is a common rheumatic disease. Symptoms including swollen, red, hot, and stiff joints. The accumulated purine in beer is one of the reasons that cause gout after drinking beer. Low purine beer, therefore, can reduce the risk of beer drinkers suffering from gout. Meanwhile, oxidation in beer causes off-flavors and darkened color. Based on these problems, our team proposed to edit the yeast used in beer fermentation in order to produce a beer with low purine content and good antioxidant properties. We engineered the wild-type yeast by synthetic biology method such that the engineered yeast is able to produce and secrete three enzymes--purine nucleoside phosphorylase1 (PNP1), superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), and endochitinase (chit42). PNP1 can improve the utilization of purines, hence prevents purine accumulation in beer. The SOD1 and endochitinase will increase antioxidation in the final product.
https://teams.igem.org/3790	Diagnostics	Candida albicans cause diseases as vaginal infections, affecting up to 75% of women. However, current detection methods are either professional, time-consuming, inaccurate, or expensive. We have develop "Candicamera", a product that allows rapid detection of Candida albicans in resource-limited settings and for point-of-care analysis. By applying loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) combined with lateral flow assay (LFA), our detection method is accurate, fast and independent of expensive equipments. Besides, We designed gene circuits using new iGEM Registry parts gp2 and gp5.7 which reduce the background protein production of engineering bacteria and specifically produce the enzyme entailed in detection so that the cost can be reduced tremendously, thus providing access for women in resource-limited areas to routinely perform the test. We carried out extensive human practices to bring forward our project as well as synthetic biology into people.
https://teams.igem.org/3791	New Application	Drug-resistant bacteria cause 700,000 deaths per year, which could rise to 10 million by 2050. When standard treatments are not effective, saving lives implies rapidly profiling the pathogen's resistance, but traditional methods can delay this process from hours to days. The Antibiotic Resistance Inference Array (ARIA) aims to become a proof-of-concept for an innovative system that tackles this problem. First, we combine advanced algorithms to analyze large amounts of microbe genomic and functional data and define lists of resistance-related markers. Then, we create a library of self-growable biosensors that detect these markers, and we deploy them on a paper-based array: by adding a pathogenic sample to the array, a fluorescence pattern emerges. Finally, a cross-platform computer vision application automatically extracts from this pattern the set of markers found and sends it to an artificial intelligence module, which integrates it with patient-specific information to infer the most suitable countermeasure available.

There are multiple causes of food insecurity including low household income and food deserts. We are addressing the problem by extending the shelf life of fresh produce so more members of our community have access to balanced meals. Our solution is the ChiFresh system composed of debit card-accessible refrigerators in areas with decreased access to fresh produce, a chitosan-based protective coating that extends the shelf life of fresh produce, and chitin-based packaging that is biodegradable. We focused on lowering the cost and environmental impact of chitin production. We developed engineered cells intended to secrete chitin known as the Chitin Secretion Cells and we converted Brewer's Spent Yeast into a medium for growing the Chitin Secretion Cells. ChiFresh has the potential to combat food insecurity in the Big Bend area and beyond.
https://teams.igem.org/3793	New Application	Certain associations have been established that link several metabolites associated with the gut microbiota to mental disorders, amongst other illnesses. However, reliable measurements of these compounds are a major drawback for a better understanding of the connection between the gut microbiota and the brain. GutLux, our ingestible biosensor, tackles this by measuring the concentration of the metabolites in vivo, inside the gut. GutLux is comprised of two parts. The biological component responds to the concentration of metabolite by producing a light signal that can be measured quantitatively. The electronic component measures this signal and converts it to readable, wirelessly transmittable data. Our design focuses on compounds associated with mental health, but its use could be extended to other gut metabolites by adapting the biological component. In addition, we have devoted ourselves to create awareness of the importance of the gut microbiota in our wellbeing and its impact on mental health.
https://teams.igem.org/3794	Therapeutics	Spinal cord injuries (SCI) result from spinal cord damage and are characterized by nerve degeneration, growth inhibition and inflammation at the lesion site. As the central nervous system has limited regenerative abilities, neural recovery plateaus and a glial scar forms inhibiting axonal regeneration. Between 250,000 to 500,000 individuals worldwide are impacted yearly by life-altering repercussions, including paralysis. Our project focuses on developing a therapy for SCI through the convergence of synthetic biology, recombinant protein technology and regenerative medicine. We have designed a personalised 3D-bioprinted polycaprolactone scaffold, with growth-supporting topographical features for implementation alongside our synthetic mussel foot protein bioadhesive. This multidirectional approach ensures our scaffold remains fixed and encourages axonal regeneration. Furthermore, we have incorporated the use of our optimised chondroitinase ABC enzyme to enhance functional recovery and improve our treatment. Our enzyme degrades chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans and has the potential to improve axonal sprouting following SCI.
https://teams.igem.org/3795	New Application	Dengue flavivirus (DENV) is responsible for many deaths worldwide. The existing diagnostic assays are non-specific and may cross-react with other flaviviruses, such as Zika which leads to false-positive results in serological tests. To solve this problem, we developed Ammit: a chimeric protein made from DENV epitopes, used as an antigen to capture anti-Dengue antibodies. Based on the bioengineering cycle, we selected the most promising epitopes for Ammits design. For this, we analyzed its structure and binding to antibodies using different computational tools. The DNA sequence of the best protein was synthesized and cloned into a plasmid. After transformation of E. coli, expression was induced and the protein was purified. Next, we tested the binding of Ammit to commercial anti-DENV2 antibodies. We also consulted professionals to verify the project's impact on complications due to misdiagnosis. Eventually, Ammit will constitute a point of care device that will provide fast and specific results.
https://teams.igem.org/3796	WIKI	Saline-alkaline soil, containing heavy soluble salt and alkali, can endanger the environmental safety and agricultural production, and thus is a global concern. &#947;-PGA, a polymer formed by glutamic acid, is an emerging solution for this problem because it can prevent soil moisture from evaporating, help to build ideal soil structure, absorb the exchangeable sodium ion and act as buffer in soil pH changes. Aimed to restore saline-alkaline soil, above all, we engineered Corynebacterium glutamicum to make it produce &#947;-PGA based on genes from Bacillus subtilis. Secondly, to harvest &#947;-PGA as much as possible, we modified genes in oxaloacetic acid node and &#945;-ketoglutarate node to yield more glutamic acid, the raw material for &#947;-PGA. Finally, in view of biosafety, we designed a kill switch that can only be turned on when both the ionic strength and pH of the soil decrease to an expected level.
https://teams.igem.org/3797	WIKI	Tyrian purple, mainly composed of 6,6'-dibromoindigo (6BrIG), is an ancient dye extracted from sea snails and was recently demonstrated as a biocompatible semiconductor material. However, its synthesis remains limited due to uncharacterized biosynthetic pathways and the difficulty of regiospecific bromination. Here, we introduce an effective 6BrIG production strategy in Escherichia coli using tryptophan 6-halogenase SttH, tryptophanase TnaA and flavin-containing monooxygenase MaFMO. After our transformation, E. coli will become a producer of tyrian purple, and it has been proved to be used as a biological dye.
https://teams.igem.org/3798	High School	With the aggravating problem of precious metal profligacy, a low-cost reusing device must be developed. In our project, we use Ag+ aptamers to demonstrate the possibility of using ion specific aptamer connected to fusion proteins that are bound cellulose to capture and release silver ions in water.
https://teams.igem.org/3799	Therapeutics	Subclinical Bovine mastitis is a ubiquitous problem in the dairy industry. Clinical stages of this are associated with inflammation of the bovine mammary-parenchyma tissue following pathogenic infection. Whereas the early subclinical stage has invisible symptoms - making it difficult to detect and cure. Present detection techniques are either expensive, inaccessible, or time-consuming, and current treatment methods use antibiotics leading to the development of AMR in causative pathogens resulting in a lot of harm. Our team aims to develop an antibiotic-free treatment method along with a real-time cheap, colourimetric detection kit which when used at regular intervals will detect subclinical stage from milk samples. Early detection complemented with better treatment methods and hygiene maintenance can reduce the rate of disease progression. The team engaged in learning real-world problems faced by stakeholders due to bovine mastitis - tried to mitigate those in our project and spread awareness about preventing its transmission.
https://teams.igem.org/3800	Diagnostics	The objective of our bio-electric device is to detect Enterobacteriaceae, which are Gram&#8208;negative, non&#8208;spore forming, predominantly motile, facultative anaerobic bacilli. These bacteria communicate predominantly through quorum sensing, a biochemical process where signaling molecules turn genes on and off depending on density. By coupling this communication system with a fluorescent reporter and electronic components, we can improve upon pre-existing biosensors by increasing scalability and portability. Through the use of bioengineered E. coli cells that react to the presence of autoinducer-2, we produce a measurable fluorescent signal. The amount of fluorescence is then correlated to contamination using our dry-lab mechanical/electrical device: a cost-effective fluorometer built to test samples in common microcentrifuge tubes. Missouri_Miners 2021 project blends the boundaries between synthetic biology and electronics, seeking to improve the viability of biosensors in food manufacturing.

https://teams.igem.org/3802	Environment	Microcystin-LR (MC-LR), a toxin produced by cyanobacterial algal blooms, contaminates lakes and causes severe illness and death in humans and wildlife. Removing MC-LR with conventional techniques is costly and produces toxic byproducts. Therefore, we plan to use MlrA, an enzyme native to Sphingomonas spp., which linearizes the ring structure of MC-LR and reduces its toxicity. While previous works have expressed this enzyme in E. coli, we hope to achieve higher yields through two novel methods. The first anchors MlrA on the outer membrane of E. coli via a fusion protein with poly-&#947;-glutamate. The second secretes MlrA into the periplasm using TatExpress, a super-secreting strain, to increase the expression of transport membrane proteins. This project also proposes a microcystin detection method using a two-hybrid bacterial assay. Overall, employing these modified bacteria into a biofilter and detection system is a potential method for reducing microcystin toxicity in a safe, cost-effective way.
https://teams.igem.org/3803	Manufacturing	Every year, about 14,000 tons of sunscreen are deposited into the ocean, producing a large amount of chemical pollution, especially oxybenzone and octyl-methoxycinnamate. This has greatly worsened the phenomenon of coral bleaching, and will further lead to the collapse of marine ecosystem, as coral reefs are home to 25% marine species. To alleviate the current situation, we are developing an eco-friendly bio-sunscreen that is harmless to coral reefs and the marine ecosystem. Inspired by how marine species in nature protect themselves from UV rays, we have decided to produce gadusol, a natural UV filter originated from zebrafish, as the main component of our bio-sunscreen product. We first introduced the synthetic pathway of gadusol into Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Then, the utilization pathway of xylose was also introduced to engineer it into a high-yield cell factory. By doing this, we hope to balance the use of sunscreen and the protection of coral reefs.
https://teams.igem.org/3804	Therapeutics	Incoming aging society asks us: "How can we extend the healthy life expectancy?". There are many obstacles to answering the question, one of which is bedsore. A bedsore is a severe wound that often occurs in people who spend a long time in bed. It requires continuous care by medical professionals and keeps patients away from home even after recovering from the initial symptoms. Our team suggests a solid solution to this problem by creating YEAST-AID for bedsore. This project aimed to help everyone takes care of bedsore correctly and efficiently, discharging millions of people from extended hospitalization. Our solution, YEAST-AID is a multifunctional wound dressing using synthetic yeast. The yeast has three functions supporting wound care: wound monitoring by oxygen concentration, infection prevention by antimicrobial peptides, and detection of P. aeruginosa infection. Furthermore, the yeast is appropriately integrated into the fiber-like hardware to function safely on the wound.
https://teams.igem.org/3805	WIKI	In industrial production, inevitable mutations and phenotypic variations will lead to the appearance of cheater cells which avoid the burden of synthesizing exogenous products. Given the liberation from synthesis, cheaters may gain remarkable survival advantages over common workers. Such strain degeneration will therefore lead to a great loss in both quality and quantity of the products. To solve this problem, BNU-China seeks inspiration from a natural colonial model, in which guard bacterial cells can specifically eliminate cheater cells to maintain the balance of the population. We decide to develop a universal cheater-proof platform for industrial production by introducing carefully engineered guards and workers into the system.
https://teams.igem.org/3806	Diagnostics	Hidden hunger, synonymous with micronutrient deficiencies, is estimated to impact the health and life-quality of one in three people, especially in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Current monitoring policies are insufficient, as more data on hidden hunger is required to implement solutions effectively. However, existing detection techniques remain inaccessible for most people. Here, we present AptaVita: a modular, quantitative, and accessible paper-based rapid diagnostic test for vitamin deficiencies available at the point-of-care. Aptazymes (ligand-regulated self-cleaving ribozymes) engineered through in vitro evolution for binding the vitamins of interest are fused with the lacZ reporter gene. Vitamin-responsive translation activation is enabled in the PURE cell-free expression system on paper support. The colorimetric output is quantified by a portable, 3D-printed, dedicated hardware, allowing us to assess the level of targeted vitamins. We envision AptaVita making hidden hunger visible and addressable, thereby contributing to monitoring and tackling vitamin deficiencies together with those involved.
https://teams.igem.org/3807	Foundational Advance	Targeted continuous evolution, using a platform based on CRSIPR-Cas-based nickase and error-prone DNA polymerase (a.k.a. EvolvR), is a powerful approach to rapidly evolve specific phenotypes with minimal user intervention. By establishing this method in planta, we seek to accelerate the evolution of needed plant phenotypes such as (a)biotic stress tolerance. EvolvR, targeted to a gene of interest by a specific guide RNA, continuously diversify the underlying DNA, with cells constantly under selection for improved variants. We have confirmed the efficiency of the approach in E. coli, validated it in a plant-based cell-free system and confirmed its functionality in Tobacco BY-2 cell culture. We have also established mathematical approaches to model and optimize the selection regimens to maximize the efficiency of the pipeline. Our in silico, in vitro and in vivo results further demonstrate the potential of EvolvR to plant biotechnology improving crops and developing new plant-based applications.
https://teams.igem.org/3808	WIKI	Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) outbreaks are one of the leading causes of food recalls in the United States; infections can cause diarrhea, vomiting, fever, and even kidney failure and death. We developed a programmable in-situ gene-elimination system, Progenie, to selectively knock-out the Shiga-toxin producing gene stx2 from an environmental microbial communityreducing STEC outbreaks without harming commensal bacteria. Progenie consists of an initial phage delivery of a conjugatable plasmid encoding an RNA-guided transposon system that self-integrates into a targeted locus and spreads to neighboring microbes. Using E. coli with chromosomally-integrated mcherry as a model for stx2, we measure mCherry fluorescence to quantify the effectiveness and extent of our gene knockout system. Progenie can not only reduce STEC-related food recalls, illness, and waste, but can generalize to disable virulence factors or antibiotic resistance in a host of other microbes.
https://teams.igem.org/3809	Environment	We designed a biosensor for the detection of Endocrine Disruptive Compounds (EDCs) in samples of bottled water. This biosensor works through the immobilization of protein receptor hER alpha on a piezoelectric sensor. The protein captures these chemicals, while the piezoelectric sensor senses the change of mass through a change of the natural resonance of the quartz. This signal is recieved and interpreted by a circuit of our own design and will give us information about the concentration of EDCs on the sample of water. We focused on the enzymatic degradation of these compounds as well, through the expression of a Laccase. We plan on introducing this step as part of the purification process of fresh water, guaranteeing EDC-free water to our community and reducing the risk of developing any serious illness.
https://teams.igem.org/3810	High School	The Peruvian cacao industry has been heavily impacted by the new European Union regulations which placed a limit of 0.8mg/kg of cadmium (Cd) in cacao products due to the carcinogenic and toxic effects on organ systems. Only 5% of Peruvian cacao currently meets these requirements leading to over 50,000 Peruvian cacao farmers reporting income loss. Our team, in collaboration with Alianza Cacao (an organization representing Peruvian cacao farmers), is working on developing a Cd detection and bioremediation system to be implemented during the cacao liquor stage of production. This way, we hope to provide a system that will impede Cd from transferring to the final products of chocolate and cacao powder.
https://teams.igem.org/3811	WIKI	Our project aims to reduce, and maybe even solve, a local environmental, health, and economic issue: Ulva spp. Green tides in Brittany, caused by anthropogenic eutrophication. Eutrophication induces anoxic zones that enhance the proliferation of Sulfacto Reductor Bacterias (SRB). SRB uses Ulva algae to produce hydrogen sulfide, which is deadly for a wide variety of organisms, even in small concentrations. Consequently, the whole underwater ecosystem could be damaged. Using chemical, biochemical and biological tools, our team wants to accelerate and valorize the degradation of Ulva spp., by recycling the sulfate and finding utilization for the remaining biomass (biomethane extraction, bioplastic, and compost manufacture). As it is slowly becoming a global problem, we want to raise awareness of this phenomenon through meetings, games, and social media. Thanks to collaborations with several companies that made our project possible, we expect to encourage other countries to follow up and value their green tides.
https://teams.igem.org/3812	Environment	Microalgae are among the most efficient carbon sequestering organisms known, and the CHINA-FAFU iGEM team has used synthetic biology and molecular biology as the core tools to explore the association between key genes of ascorbic acid metabolic pathway and carbon dioxide fixation and lipid anabolism in microalgae, and to construct various engineered algal strains to verify the functions of related genetic elements. At the same time, we will use mathematical models to predict the possibility of practical production applications of the algae strains. Our project can provide a reference for the design and cultivation of excellent engineered strains of microalgae, and promote the reduction of biodiesel production cost and the international trend of new energy and carbon neutral economy.
https://teams.igem.org/3813	High School	With 2.3 million women diagnosed and 685,000 deaths in 2020, breast cancer has become a major problem in the global community. However, early detection can help increase the survival of patients. Current detection methods include mammograms and MRIs, which can be uncomfortable and expensive, raising the need for a better alternative. For our two-year project, we plan on creating a convenient breast cancer testing kit that would be similar in design to a pregnancy test through the detection of biomarkers found in sweat and tears. This year, we focused on verifying the interaction between aptamers and biomarkers using ELISA before developing a colorimetric aptamer-based detection assay with gold nanoparticles, which we hope will translate into our testing kit next year. Through our detection kit, we hope to raise early screening rates, allowing women to go through a pain-free and simple process that is reliable and accurate to detect breast cancer.
https://teams.igem.org/3814	Village	Free Coli aimed to improve accessibility to synthetic biology by designing a genetically modified naturally transformable strain of Escherichia coli to produce a more affordable and efficient host organism that does not require chemical treatment or electroporation to become competent. Literature on natural transformation in E. coli and related bacterium was reviewed and experts were consulted to identify twenty-five putative natural transformation genes in A. baylyi for insertion into E. coli via a novel recombineering strategy for insertion of multiple gene clusters. K-means clustering used existing data on transcriptome concentration and promoter strength to model the optimal clustering of genes into eight <5kB DNA fragments. Bioinformatics analysis was conducted to assemble the genes into fragments with salicylate promoters and selectable markers. The wider community was engaged and consulted to affirm the projects purpose and align its future implementation with the UNs Sustainable Development Goal to ensure quality education for all.
https://teams.igem.org/3815	Environment	Since time immemorial, flowers have been providing us with comfort and beauty on occasions ranging from mourning to celebration. While cut flowers are in high demand, they are ultimately treated as disposable products leading to large amounts of pre- and post-consumer waste. To make this intimate and essential relationship sustainable, iGEM Kyoto proposes a colorful palette of measures for each process from flower production to consumption. Our discussions with stakeholders revealed that many flowers are lost to insects or diseases. Accordingly, we attempted to kill pests with RNAi, and developed a virus detection device based on RT-LAMP and CRISPR-Cas12a. Alternative to chemicals, we suggest dsRNA and peptides to delay flower wilting. Notably, for more efficient syntheses of these eco-friendly materials, we proposed a system using asymmetric plasmid partitioning. Although fragility and mortality may add to a flower's beauty, an extended life span will allow them to be enjoyed by many.
https://teams.igem.org/3816	High School	Inspired by Fast Fashion, which is a threat to the environment at disposal, we came up with the idea of utilizing biodegradable silk. In this project, E. coli BL21 is aimed to be engineered to produce a protein named spidroin, which is the basic unit of spider silk. Masp1 and Masp2 from dragline, flagelliform silk protein from capture spiral silk and pyriform silk protein (PiSp) from piriform silk are planned to be manufactured. In the future, the mechanical properties of silk products, like strength, will be adjusted by controlling the proportion of spidroin with different toughness and elasticity. Thus, we hope to obtain spidroin with different properties to cater for different needs, like making clothes or fishing line, hence bringing an environmentally friendly solution to Fast Fashion disposal.

People drink coffee during the daytime, but toss and turn at night because of the exciting effect of caffeine. In order to help humans better manage caffeine intake, we designed DeCaffi Project. Utilizing the conversion from caffeine to theacrine catalyzed by Cdh and CkTcS, we realized caffeine removal from customers' coffee. In view of the special liquid environment of hot coffee, we improved thermal stability of these enzymes through directed evolution and software PROSS. Using immobilized enzyme technology, we constructed a cell-free system that can quickly remove caffeine in our specially designed coffee cup, in which the sensor can monitor the changes of caffeine in real time. Additionally, considering convenience and user-friendliness, our software group has designed an App, which can collect data from coffee cups and bracelets, providing users with real-time caffeine intake suggestions.

https://teams.igem.org/3819	New Application	Nowadays the recycling rate of office waste paper (OWP) in China is dramatically low. We find that cellulase, xylanase, lipase, and laccase will allow bio-deinking to occur, by helping the ink detach from the waste paper and decomposing hazardous substances. We also design a new surface assembly of a functional cellulosome by using Pichia pastoris. Otherwise, to bring our idea to the real world, we design a paper recycle machine (Deinker) &#65292;which includes the transmission part, enzyme liquid smearing part, deinking part, and paper drying part. Through this device, the OWP will be reborn. In addition, 5 mathematical models are built for improving experiments, hardware, and implementation. Moreover, Human Practice has been constantly advancing as the project progresses, we design related activities from four aspects: practical issues, technology, market and industry, policy, and law to understand the exact needs of stakeholders.

Meanwhile, the use of traditional pesticides and antibiotics is causing problems including antimicrobial resistance and social ethical issues. Therefore, we seek to find out an alternative way to treat microbial plant diseases. Through research, we found that phage therapy can be useful towards infectious diseases. However, storage difficulties and limited functional time result in the phage therapy's low popularity. Due to these problems, we intend to use synthetic biology technologies and phage delivery bacteria to develop a more efficient phage therapy towards Xanthomonas diseases.
https://teams.igem.org/3821	Diagnostics	Early screening and treatment of colorectal cancer(CRC) has been proved to be conducive to reducing the mortality rate of CRC. Currently, most diagnostic methods do not meet the requirements of rapid, sensitive and specific screening of CRC. Based on the selection of miRNA as our biomarker for its high sensitivity and specificity&#65292;we developed an ultrasensitive approach for miRNA detection based on a combination of Loop-mediated isothermal amplification(LAMP), CRISPR-Cas12a trans-cleavage and SlipChip. We also designed temperature-control and fluorescence detection modules to erect an interactive IVD system for POCT detection. Our system has been tested to be simple to operate, for completing the process within 1h&#65292;and its sensitivity reaches to fM level. Furthermore, our system has the capacity to detect different miRNAs, giving the potential to build standardized cancer detection platforms.
https://teams.igem.org/3822	High School	Colorectal cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world. The current method for early diagnosis of colorectal cancer remains as a big limitation. Previous reporters identified syndecan-2 (SDC2) and tissue factor pathway inhibitor 2 (TFPI2) were aberrantly methylated in Colorectal Cancer. Quantitative methylation-specific PCR (qMSP) for detecting methylated SDC2 and TFPI2 has been reported as an effective early screening method for colorectal cancer. Toehold switches are a class of RNAs with a hairpin loop that can be unfolded upon binding a trigger RNA for translation initiation of the reporter protein, which plays an important role in clinical diagnoses. In this study, we constructed a toehold plasmid and incubated it in the cell free protein expression system with methylated TFPI2 with a trigger sequence, which offers a non-invasive and visible approach for early detection of colorectal cancer in the future.
https://teams.igem.org/3823	Environment	Since the implementation of household garbage sorting regulations in Shanghai, the amount of food waste has reached a peak. However, problems caused by odor like unpleasant smell and health problems, have aroused great attention everywhere. This year, Tongji China launches the "LOOK!" project to solve the problem. We construct two kinds of bioengineered E.coli to absorb hydrogen sulfide and ammonia, which are the two main ingredients in the odor. One uses enzymes related to sulfide oxidazation(Sqr, Sdo, AprBA and Sat), converting hydrogen sulfide to sulfate, while the other uses enzymes AMO, HAO and NOD to convert ammonia to nitrate. Besides, a three-gear adjustable kill switch based on the concentration of H2S and NH3 is added to ensure biosafety. Also, we optimize our pathway by high throughput screening and machine learning. With such efforts, we hope to solve the problems the odor brought to people and downstream industries.
https://teams.igem.org/3824	High School	siRNA is a potent therapeutic agent because of its specificity and efficiency suppressing genes overexpressed during pathogenesis. However, due to lack of cell type-specific and safe delivery methods, it shows limited success in cancer treatment. Therefore, we aim to design CPP which forms a siRNA/CPP complex targeting neoplasia. Two engineered CPP based on buforin IIB - MV1 (-RLLR) and MV2 (-RLLRRLLR) - were tested. Among three types of CPPs, MV1 displayed highest specificity for A549 (cancerous). Next, our goal was to enhance the anticancer efficacy of doxorubicin (chemotherapy drug) mediated by MV1/siRNA complex. Since CYP1A1 is upregulated in doxorubicin-resistant cancer cells, siRNA was designed to target CYP1A1. Our result showed that MV1/siRNA complex efficiently suppressed CYP1A1 gene expression. Finally, MV1-DOX/siRNA complex increased anticancer efficacy of doxorubicin in A549, while showing minimal cell death on MRC5. Overall, results suggest MV1 could deliver antineoplastics and siRNA to improve anticancer efficacy.

For example, bladder cancer has a recurrence of up to 24%-84% of patients within 5 years after surgical resection, and the overexpression of C-MYC protein is approximately related to 44%-69% of the cases. We investigated the urinary tract pathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) Lon protein and find it can effectively degrade C-MYC protein, thereby inhibiting the proliferation of cancer cells. We use E. coli to produce highly active Lon protease this year, and propose this protein can be designed into drugs to improve the surgical prognosis of bladder cancer populations with C-MYC gene overexpression.
https://teams.igem.org/3826	Diagnostics	This year, iGEM Düsseldorf sets the focus on pathogen detection and differentiation. The aim is to design an adaptable quick-test with three potential applications. Firstly, to detect common plant diseases on young plants, secondly, to detect pathogens in-field before signs of infection are even visible, with the help of multispectral imaging cameras that identify plants with reduced photosynthetic activity. Thirdly, to be able to differentiate between known diseases that are hard to identify with the naked eye. The plants can be tested with our lateral flow assay consisting of two aptamers that have been carefully selected through the SELEX process. These aptamers bind specifically to either a protein expressed during the plants stress response or the pathogenic cell itself, precisely detecting the cause of stress. To visualize general plant stresses immediately, a reporter plant was designed, whose colour changes depending on the kind of stress its exposed to.
https://teams.igem.org/3827	Village	Immunotherapies are cancer treatments which activate the immune system against the tumour. While very effective in some patients, many do not respond to immunotherapy. To personalize treatment, tissue biopsies are used to profile tumour immune activity and inform likelihood of immunotherapy response but are invasive and prone to sampling bias. Salmonella bacteria naturally colonize tumours, and have been proven safe as a therapeutic in clinical trials. Our project creates an in vivo Salmonella-based biosensor for minimally invasive diagnosis and real-time monitoring of tumour immune activity. We construct a functional screening system to discover promoters regulated by tumour immune markers across the Salmonella genome, and implement an AND-gate with a split-operon technique to detect multiple biomarkers. The biosensor will be adaptable to detect other clinically relevant biomarkers, and to deliver therapeutics. This project is a gateway to a multifunctional platform to support the growth of immunotherapy and personalized medicine

https://teams.igem.org/3829	High School	Our goal is to develop a whole-cell biocatalyst by displaying PETase and MHETase on the surface of yeast cell (Candida tropicalis) to degrade PET waste. Firstly, we chose a robust Candida tropicalis as the host and deleted the URA3 gene of genome to block the uracil synthesis by CRISPR-Cas9. In order to display the protein more efficiently, we must obtain the appropriate anchor protein. Therefore, we built a model to predict the anchor protein candidates. We used an enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) as the reporter and inserted the codon-optimized GFP gene to the genome of Candida tropicalis by homologous recombination. Finally, we selected the best one from 89 anchor proteins, fused it with PETase, and then incubated the yeast with PET waste. We hope the yeast with surfaced PETase can degrade the PET more efficiently and achieved the recycling of PET waste.
https://teams.igem.org/3830	Environment	Our main goal is to use the synthetic biological strategy for achieving an example of circular agriculture. Rice could feed half of the global population, and tons of rice straws are produced after harvest. Inappropriate rice straws management, straws burning, causes problems releasing CO<sub>2</sub>, PAHs, and PM2.5. In this project, we constructed the Clostridial cellulase genes within Bacillus subtilis WB800 and the cellulosomal enzymes could be formed. It will be used for effective straws decomposition and used as a medium for culturing our beneficial endophyte. Furthermore, we constructed an artificial endophyte through versatile biostimulant, pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) producing Bacillus subtilis and cultured by saccharified straw liquid. The PQQ containing broth will exogenously apply to the rice and/or other plants to promote their growth. Our example for circular agriculture could be completed by the above strategy, while agricultural waste can be recycled into valuable products and also could reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emission.
https://teams.igem.org/3831	Village	Our team created a system for phosphate removal from water. The system is based on modified Bacillus subtilis. This bacterium is designed to be able to measure the amount of phosphate in water. If the phosphate exceeds a certain threshold concentration, the bacterium will start to form a system to pick it up. This consists of an enzyme that will bind the phosphate into long chains (polyphosphate kinase) and protein vesicles (bacterial microcompartments, BMCs) that will enclose the phosphate chains. According to the design, these modified bacteria will be placed in water in a system that prevents their escape into the environment. After a period of time, the bacteria with the accumulated phosphates will be removed from the water, inactivated, and can be further utilized. We envision their use either as fertilizer or as a source of phoshporus for the chemical industry.

According to our ideas, a gene circuit based on Toogle-Switch is designed to reach the goal of switching between two statuses: tryptophan-producing and proliferating, by reacting to signals of IPTG and temperature. On top of that, considering the situation of COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown, we give our project further application by constructing a hardware to help people release their pain in their home by drinking a cup of milk with additional tryptophan in it. We believe this design will actually aid people in dealing with their mental health problems, especially during the pandemic, in a much safer and user-friendly way.

This project aims to improve tissue healing by developing a prokaryotic collagen-based scaffold; this acts as a pre-programmed framework that precisely directs the growth arrangements of mouse myoblasts and fibroblasts. Strains of Escherichia coli were engineered to produce Scl2 proteins with binding motifs for integrin and fibronectin; these customizable protein products were incorporated into a hydrogel, providing a physical structure to which the mouse cells attach. The hydrogels feature optimal spatial distributions of binding motifs tailored to each cell line, causing them to grow in desired patterns due to the differences in their respective ECM affinities for integrin and fibronectin binding sites. The effectiveness of these hydrogels was characterized through cell cultures and microscopic imaging.

Hence, there is an unmet clinical need for new and effective drugs. However, a long-existing problem in drug discovery is the cost-effectiveness issue in finding effective drugs for clinical use. To address this, our team aims to develop a simple and cost-effective fungal synthetic biology platform to produce various derivatives of variecolin, a fungal natural product that shows potent therapeutic and antimicrobial properties. The platform consists of the genetically modified Aspergillus oryzae host with (1) a terpene synthase biobrick for the backbone synthesis and (2) a series of different cytochrome P450 monooxygenase biobricks to derivatize the variecolin scaffold. We have successfully obtained three novel variecolin analogues as confirmed by LC-MS and NMR analyses, and experiments are currently underway to characterize their biological activities.

Our goal is to generate a kind of pine tree that can synthesize siRNA that encodes important gene information to B.xylophilus, such as targeting genes related to reproduction and pathogenicity. As soon as the nematodes uptake plant cells, siRNA generate by pine trees will knock down genes that significantly influent the survival of nematodes. We build a model to simulate how the diffusion of siRNA in B.xylophilus. And the birth and dead model we build is to simulate the activity of nematodes on plant callus. We have published an article on PanSci and meet related environmental groups. Our podcast program has launched on several platforms and we designed a board game--Adaptor, introducing this environmental issue and synthetic biology to the public. We hope to generate an efficient method to solve PWD comparing to traditional methods.
https://teams.igem.org/3836	Village	Acute or chronic exposure to ionizing radiation (UVC, gamma rays, X rays) leads to the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which affect the genome and the proteome of cells. Thus, although photosynthetic microorganisms such as Chlamydomonas reinhardtii constitute one of the main hopes for developing Bioregenerative Life-Support System during long-term space travel, their use is called into question by the decrease of efficiency of the photochemistry and by the growth arrest caused by ROS. Our project aims to make Chlamydomonas reinhardtii produce a peptide complexing with the Mn2+ ion inspired by a metabolite found in the radioresistant organism Deinococcus radiodurans and acting as an antixoidant. This study requires to demonstrate a decrease in ROS within the cell during production of the peptide and verifying the growth of microalgae cultivated in minimum medium (photosynthesis dependent growth).
https://teams.igem.org/3837	Environment	Amphibians are facing an uncertain future. A third of global amphibian species have become endangered due to habitat loss, climate change, and the lethal chytrid fungus. The invasive chytrid fungus has been prevalent in many parts of the globe but a reliable solution is not available yet. This year, our focus is on the biological control of the chytrid fungus by engineering skin symbiotic bacteria. We designed a genetic AND-gate that produces the antifungal agents (e.g. violacein) only working under sunlight warming frogs and the detection of chytrid. To avoid environmental risks, we also designed a quorum sensing kill switch based on the MazEF toxin-antitoxin module. We surveyed the skin microbiome of frogs for a potential chassis of our design. Our therapeutic approach will contribute to protecting susceptible amphibian species from the invasive chytrid disease.

The disease is currently incurable and exerts many different stresses on patients. This year, we aim to develop a 'cocktail' of customized, genetically engineered intestinal probiotics as an adjuvant to alleviate the recurrence of IBD and improve patient's quality of life. Based on E. coli Nissle 1917 and L. lactis, we express four related substances to target IBD: butyric acid, which can consolidate the intestinal barrier and inhibit inflammatory pathways; human antimicrobial peptide LL37 for LPS resistance; SOD to reverse peroxide stress state; and BSH to reverse abnormal bile acid metabolism and reduce inflammation. To successfully implement our project in the context of potential patient needs, we write a business plan and design a series of hardware devices. We believe our project will be practical and can offer far-reaching benefits to many future patients.
https://teams.igem.org/3839	Diagnostics	iGEM Patras 2021 goal is to characterize the impact of genomic variants, derived from targeted panel-based resequencing using a portable next-generation sequencer, on the enzymatic activity of CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 enzymes, responsible for the metabolism of clinically used drugs, using in vitro assays. These variants will be engineered into gene constructs, via site-directed mutagenesis in eukaryotic 293FT cells, encoding these enzymes and will be subsequently characterized as deleterious or benign, and compared against in silico prediction scores. Furthermore, to validate the mechanisms underlying the molecular interaction between the mutated CYP isoforms and the chemical substrates, we used molecular simulation methods like docking, to confirm the potential deleterious effect of the identified PGx variants.
https://teams.igem.org/3840	Therapeutics	Osteoarthritis is the most common musculoskeletal disease around the world, often leading to chronic pain and severe paralysis. Osteoarthritis is characterized by an intense inflammation cycle, in which chondrocytes produce certain proteins that cause cartilage degradation. Our approach aims to halt this inflammatory cycle by inserting specifically transfected cells in the osteoarthritic joint. The cells produce synthetically designed exosomes that contain miRNA-140. miRNA-140 has been shown to inhibit the expression of certain cartilage destructive proteins and promote the expression of regenerative agents. The exosomes are also designed to carry a Chondrocyte Affinity Peptide (CAP) in their membrane which guides them to deliver their cargo specifically towards chondrocytes. This project includes in-silico and in-vitro experiments that study the efficiency of the proposed plasmid to produce exosomes in HEK293T cells. Project dissemination activities include a novel web application to communicate osteoarthritis risks to the public.
https://teams.igem.org/3841	Foundational Advance	Methane is a potent greenhouse gas contributing to climate change. The UN Sustainable Development Goals clearly emphasize the immediate need to combat climate changes to promote sustainability. Our project, Pheast, endeavored to design and test an engineered cell factory in yeast to use methane as a feedstock. We used Komagataella phaffii (P. pastoris), a methylotrophic yeast, to engineer this cell-factory since it has been used extensively in industrial protein production due to its high protein-secretion as well as ease of protein purification. To make the cell factory effectively use methane as a carbon source, recombinant pMMO subunits were incorporated from a natural methanotrophic bacteria, M. capsulatus. This way, methane is converted to methanol and K. phaffii can further use its native metabolic pathway to produce protein of interest. In the future, we believe this project will open the arena to produce many proteins of interest using this engineered, methane-consuming cell-factory.
https://teams.igem.org/3842	North America	In research published in the past year, two critical proteins, Gas6 and EGF, have shown promise for treating stress-related and androgenetic alopecia. Plasmids were constructed for transformation into Pichia pastoris, E.coli, and Bacillus subtilis respectively. Gas6 proteins will be purified from Pichia pastoris and EGF proteins will be expressed in E.coli using a T7 promoter to produce a cell-free protein treatment for hair loss. As a possible alternative, two plasmids with the coding sequence for each protein and a suicide switch (to prevent unwanted growth of the bacteria after treatment) were designed to create a living-cell protein expression system in B.subtilis which could be applied to the microbiome of the scalp.
https://teams.igem.org/3843	WIKI	Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by inattentiveness, an inability to focus, and restlessness. Current ADHD diagnosis procedures require a series of psychological assessments that are qualitative in nature and subject to potential clinician bias. Waterloo iGEMs 2021 project, NeuroDetech, is a quantitative tool that aids in the diagnosis of ADHD and reduces the margin of bias. NeuroDetech consists of a series of microfluidic capillary flow assay lab chips designed using process engineering methods. Each lab chip contains a binding molecule that detects an ADHD-associated biomarker or gene marker in urine. Through protein engineering and computational protein redesign methods, the binding molecule can be adapted for the sensitive detection of a variety of ADHD-associated markers. Each lab chip and optical detector emits a signal over time that is visualized on a software app, providing healthcare professionals with insight into an individuals risk for ADHD.
https://teams.igem.org/3844	Village	Lung cancer remains the deadliest cancer type, and is often undetected until stages 3 or 4, when it becomes difficult to treat [1]. W decided to investigate a noninvasive method: VOC (volatile organic compound) detection using a breath test. Our goal is to use the K-12 strain of E. coli bacteria that will produce a quantifiable color change in response to the presence of a VOC. Using published research, we identified a set of VOCs whose concentration in the breath is higher in lung cancer patients: propanol, trimethylbenzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, styrene, hexanal, acetone, and isoprene [2]. We will insert promoters that are induced by these VOCs into plasmids and a GFP gene that will produce a color change, transforming E. coli with these plasmids. This product would be implemented as a test that could use one breath sample to detect the levels of 8 separate VOCs. 1. https://www.cancer.org/cancer/lung-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/how-diagnosed.html 2. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6044508/
https://teams.igem.org/3845	Diagnostics	We are the Moscow team, and the main goal of our project - miPression - is to design a test system that can detect depression and distinguish it from other psychiatric diseases. Our diagnostic test will use miRNAs circulating in blood as biomarkers. We are going to measure it by two-step technology: first, rolling cycle amplification (RCA); second, the connection of two d&#1057;as9, which are linked with the half of GFP, to the product of the RCA. The concentration of our target miRNA will be defined based on the brightness of fluorescence. As a result, our project will help to solve the problem of misdiagnosed and undiagnosed cases of depression. In the long term, our development may help to reduce public stigmatization and break down false stereotypes about mental disorders.
https://teams.igem.org/3846	WIKI	Terpenoids are a large class of plant secondary metabolites used as food-flavors, fragrances or pharmaceuticals like artemisinic acid. Today, terpenoids are either extracted from plants they naturally occur in or produced synthetically using petrochemical starting materials.Only in a few cases have biotechnological approaches been successfully implemented for the production of terpenoids. Despite their chemical diversity, mainly two enzyme classes are required for terpenoid biosynthesis: cyclases and oxygenases. While cyclases are widely used in prokaryotes, oxygenases naturally occur as membrane-bound protein complexes. For functional expression in E. coli, soluble versions as well as compatible reductases are required. Additionally, protein expression places significant strain on the energy metabolism of E. coli. We are addressing these problems by creating fusion constructs of oxygenase and reductase proteins, as well as increasing the availability of NADPH. Advances in this field will lead to more sustainable and economical terpenoid production in the future.

Compared with wet experiments, computational methods of identifying phage-host interactions can reduce costs and save time and are more effective and economic. Through two methods, alignment-based and alignment-free, our team attempted to find accurate Phage-bacteria interactions, contributing to phage therapy, and further contributing to the application of phage as a model organism in synthetic biology.
https://teams.igem.org/3848	Therapeutics	Cancer, the second leading cause of death in the world, registered 19 million cases and about 10 million deaths in 2020 globally. Cancer treatment is both financially and mentally traumatizing for patients as current therapies suffer from a plethora of side effects and are very expensive. Our project presents an innovative approach to treat cancer using apoptosis-inducing peptides SMAC & TRAIL. TRAIL binds to the cancer cells extrinsically, thereby activating caspases, whereas SMAC induces apoptosis intrinsically and also sensitizes TRAIL-resistant cancer cells. Our chassis organism, B.longum, is an obligatory anaerobe and grows only in hypoxic regions providing specificity to target solid tumours. Furthermore, it has a lactate-based KILL SWITCH to ensure it gets killed outside the cancer environment and an AND GATE ensures secretion specificity to cancer cells only. We'd be establishing the Proof of Concept in E.coli. The objective is to design cheap and viable therapy for cancer treatment.

The group most critically affected by this increase is high school students, the peer group of The Baltimore BioCrew. To challenge the stigma and the increasing rates of mental illness, the BioCrew has created Joy-Biotic, a flavored water probiotic that will increase serotonin production by producing 5-HTP, GABA, and acetylcholine in Lactobacillus and E. coli Nissle. These molecules increase neurotransmitters in the brain. To prevent serotonin syndrome, we engineered a negative feedback loop that would regulate the levels of serotonin. To raise awareness about mental health stigma, we have created a podcast interviewing mental health professionals, a social media campaign, an educational comic, and a course teaching high school students about the relationship between the gut biome and mental health. Through oral ingestion of Joy-Biotic, the BioCrew plans to fight mental illness one flavored drop at a time
https://teams.igem.org/3852	Food & Nutrition	Taste is the soul of food. Food companies all over the world are looking for better ways to quantify the basic flavors of newly developed food products. In the food industry, human sensory panel and electronic tongue are most commonly used to evaluate taste. However, human sensory is costly and subjectively affected, while one electronic tongue cannot measure the taste of multiple food. This year BIT-China devotes to design a Creative Tasting Officer-a yeast cell biosensor to quantify the basic tastes of umami, sweetness and bitterness. Genetic circuits are designed to express human taste receptors heterologously in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and the intensity of fluorescences would quantitively reflect the respective taste degree of food samples. Furthermore, we develop a series of Soybean based Creative Seasonings and a Flavor Card Website to help people discover their favorite taste. Everyone can click the link and find the satisfying flavor with personalized color panel!!!
https://teams.igem.org/3853	Environment	Examplified by polyethylene, undegradable plastics have a degradation period of hundreds of years under natural conditions, causing severe environmental crisis worldwide. Manganese peroxidase (MnP) uses hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to produce high-redox-potential Mn3+, possessing a PE-degrading potential. Our project takes MnP as our key PE-degrading enzyme, employs aryl alcohol oxidase (AAO) to provide H2O2 for MnP, and utilizes hydrophobin-1 (HFB1) to increase substrate accessibility, as well as combines SpyCatcher-SpyTag system with CRISPR/dCas9 system to anchor MnP, AAO and HFB1 onto one double-stranded DNA scaffold according to certain spatial order, distance and proportion. The final complex works as a molecular machine that can adhere and degrade PE in a green and swift way
https://teams.igem.org/3854	Environment	How about converting a residual source into a source of creativity and expression? For every single litre of waste cooking oil (WCO) spilled, more than 1,000 litres of water are polluted. While classic recycling is unattractive, synthetic biology is a powerful tool in order to change this view and attract people to the new paradigm of a circular bioeconomy. To do so, we aim to expand the molecular toolbox of the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica for developing a bioprocess that creates value from waste. This microorganism stands out due to its ability to use oleaginous substrates to grow. First, we are implementing the full carotenoid biosynthetic pathway in this chassis. Besides, we are optimizing the stock of WCO as its carbon and energy source to produce sustainable paints based on these carotenoids pigments. Finally, we will improve the extraction of pigments and preparation of bio-paints for scaling-up.
https://teams.igem.org/3855	Therapeutics	About 15% of the worlds population suffer from bowel disorders like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and related disorders. These are triggered by so-called FODMAPs (fermentable oligo-, di-, mono-saccharides and polyols), which are non-digestible food components that lead to bloating, abdominal pain and other symptoms. So far the only therapy is a highly restrictive diet. We want to change that by addressing neglected gastrointestinal diseases and tackling one of the most common FODMAPs: Fructans, a fructose polymer. Our goal is to develop a novel therapeutic platform by the use of lactobacilli that secrete fructan-degrading enzymes. We encapsulate them in a biocompatible scaffold that keeps them safely inside while allowing the release of the produced enzymes. The surface of the scaffold is designed to have muco-adhesive properties which enable site-targeted enzyme delivery over a prolonged timespan. With this concept we want to take oral enzyme therapy to the next level.
https://teams.igem.org/3856	Village	Oxybenzone is a chemical compound found in sunscreens that serves as an active ingredient to block ultraviolet (UV) rays. Oxybenzone contributes to coral bleaching by accumulating in coral tissues and reducing sunlight availability for photosynthetic organisms due to its UV-absorbing properties. Through the genetic engineering of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, oxybenzone concentration levels in water bodies can be detected. The estrogenic properties of oxybenzone allow it to bind to a synthetic fusion protein containing a human estrogen receptor which will result in the expression of the LacZ gene. This causes the enzyme beta-galactosidase to be produced and breakdown its substrate. This produces an electrochemical signal which can be measured using the Field-Ready Electrochemical Detector (FRED) and analyzed to determine oxybenzone concentration. This will allow for greater understanding of the issue of coral bleaching, and provide a tool to assess the impact of further steps being taken to protect these aquatic ecosystems.
https://teams.igem.org/3857	Environment	The Anones Lagoon in Vieques, Puerto Rico, has been impacted by the presence of xenobiotic contaminants, whose concentrations exceed established limits by the EPA, with one of concern being a recalcitrant explosive compound, 1,3,5-Trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX). Our goal is to design R-DetoX, a two-component genetic circuit for the detection and biodegradation of RDX. An RDX-inducible sensor element is transcriptionally coupled with the quorum-sensing (QS) signal biosynthesis and transcriptional regulator genes, luxI and luxR, respectively. The second component is induced by acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL)mediated QS, activating PluxR,, which initiates the transcription of the xplA/B system. As a result, denitrification and ring-cleavage of RDX occurs, reducing the compounds recalcitrance. A fluorescent reporter follows the catabolic component, allowing for quantification of biodegradation gene expression through fluorometry. The biodetection/biodegradation of RDX by R-DetoX will allow recovery of the biodiversity and provide new tools for environmental monitoring and remediation.

These counterfeit products have significantly harmed the rights and interests of consumers and even more disrespect for artists. However, the current appraisal of artworks is poor, complicated and expensive. In this regard, GreatBay_SZ has developed ARTAG - Artificially Revolutionized Tracking Art Gadget. In ARTAG, yeast spores, which have strong tolerance and adhesion, were used as an ideal carrier for long-time DNA barcode storage. Customized DNA-encode barcode information was integrated into the genome of the yeast through homologous recombination. A CRISPR-based nucleic acid detection system was introduced to detect sequences quickly and efficiently in terms of information decoding. In general, ARTAG offers an accurate, rapid, durable, invisible and cost-efficient spore detection system to verify the authenticity of artworks. It provides new possibilities for all anti-counterfeiting technologies and markets.

https://teams.igem.org/3861	Village	Cancer is a global threat to humankind being the cause of million deaths per year. Chemotherapy often remains the last resort, with the major drawback of being non-specific. To overcome this limitation we aim to design genetically modified minicells derived from non-pathogenic <i>Salmonella</i> Typhimurium. We plan to equip our chassis to specifically target cancer tissue and inject on site a cell growth-inhibiting peptide into malignant cells. In a first approach, we validate the chassis-cell interaction by modifying the minicells with lectins that specifically adhere to a targeted cell line. Subsequently, via the type-III secretion system of <i>Salmonella</i>, the anti-cancer peptide Pep8 will be translocated into the cancer cell, and inhibit further uncontrolled cell growth. We believe our approach will provide insights to crucial aspects of cancer research such as therapy-specificity and limitation of side effects.
https://teams.igem.org/3862	Food & Nutrition	Maple syrup is a Canadian emblem. Its a big part of our economy and culture. In 2021 alone, Canada produced 45M litres of maple syrup. Maple syrup is produced by boiling maple sap to make the sticky sweet syrup we Canadians know and love. Sometimes, contaminating microorganisms create exopolysaccharides in the syrup. These polymers are dextrans: very long sugar molecules that ruin the syrups taste and texture, making it very viscous. When this occurs, it creates ropy maple syrup. This syrup cannot be sold, and so producers must pay for it to be destroyed, creating a waste of food, energy and money. We created a treatment using a designed dextranase to put into the barrels of ropy syrup to make it usable again for producers. Over the past two years, our team was able to express, purify, characterize and do the proof of concept of our dextranase.
https://teams.igem.org/3863	High School	Pollutions from plastic and food waste are both pressing matters nowadays. In synthetic biology, researchers have been developing bacteria that decompose food waste and bacteria that produce bioplastic. In this project, in hope of turning food waste into bioplastics, we first engineered acid-tolerant E. coli which survive the acidic food fermentation process. Through overexpressing fabB gene, we demonstrated significant improvement in E. coli proliferation under acidic conditions. Next, we further engineered E. coli which produces bioplastics, Polylactic acid (PLA). We improved the bioplastic-producing constructs from previous researchers and iGEM team by 1) optimizing heterologous genes PhaC-PCT; 2) adding a Phasin gene to the construct. With IR spectroscopy, we proved that our E. coli can produce PLA. Using Nile red to quantify the PLA, we also demonstrated that our constructs can increase PLA production. In addition, we also built computational models and hardware to maximize PLA production from food waste.

Most of them are reflected on the metabolic capacity of the gut microbiome, thus making it an attractive target for further research and interventions. The impairments on the microbiomes metabolic profile, called gut dysbiosis, is characterized by altered concentrations of Short Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs). Thus, we are developing a bioelectronic capsule that utilizes a biosensor which correlates the amount of gut SCFAs with gut microbiome functional capacity, also supported by a kinetics-oriented in silico analysis. The data is digitized and transmitted to a mobile application, where a multidisciplinary team of health experts evaluate the data received. If dysbiosis is detected, we alleviate it by the usage of a living biotherapeutic, synbiotic nutritional supplement in a personalized manner.
https://teams.igem.org/3867	High School	In January 2021, the Chinese government started to enforce the ban on the use of disposable plastic straws in the food industry as they cause great harm to the environment. At present, paper straws are the most popular alternative to plastic straws. However, paper straws have many defects including bad taste, easy to crack and short lifetime. Amylose is a polysaccharide chain linked by a-(1,4) glycosidic bond with D-glucose. It has poor water solubility, anti-swelling and fat insolubility, which can be used in the production of food packaging materials. In our project, we introduced two enzymes involved in amylose synthesis into E. coli: ADP glucose pyrophosphorylase containing 2 subunits ADG1 and APL1, and granule-bound starch synthase 1 (GBSS1). Once our project is completed, amylose will be synthesized and used for the production of biodegradable straw. It will replace the plastic and paper straws with a broad prospect.
https://teams.igem.org/3868	Manufacturing	With the overuse of antibiotics, more and more antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains have emerged. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are considered the promising alternatives to antibiotics. Escherichia coli is the extensively used host for the production of AMPs. However, the expression of AMPs genes is low due to the toxicity of the AMPs. In order to improve the production of various AMPs, the BL21 (DE3)-derived variant strains library with different RBS sequence of T7RNAP was constructed by base editor and CRISPR-Cas9, respectively. Excitingly, the CRISPR-Cas9 system enables to obtain 87.5% of the theoretical values variants in a single editing. Furthermore, the high throughput host screening platform for AMPs production was built, and it takes only 3 days to get the best expression host for certain AMPs production. As proof-of-concept, the production of ten hard-to-express AMPs were greatly improved. We aim to protect the human health and environment by reducing the abuse of antibiotics.

Most bacteria in nature are organized in such interconnected communities; thus the ability to engineer microbiomes constitutes an important frontier for the field of synthetic biology. Effective engineering of microbiomes heavily relies on selectivity: the ability to make the desired changes (e.g. introducing new functions) to certain species but not others. Selectivity is also critical from a biosafety perspective as the introduction of genes into unwanted hosts can cause large ecological impacts. We have developed the first computational tool to selectively engineer microbiomes, along with experimental means to evaluate it. By addressing the main biophysical processes related to gene activity and expression, our software designs microbiome- specific plasmids that are expressed optimally in certain microorganisms while having impaired expression in others. Our tool can be applied to any plasmid and microbiome.

The current removal efficiency of diclofenac is only 27% at our local wastewater treatment plant. The project objective was to contribute to the development of a microbial wastewater treatment system for the detoxification of this compound. The approach was to overexpress and extract three heterologous laccases, specific enzymes which are capable of catalyzing the conversion of diclofenac into less harmful derivatives, in engineered E. coli. We were able to successfully produce and purify CotA (from B. subtilis) and CueO (from E. coli), of which CotA was shown to have catalytic activity in vitro. Implementation of this work would include the expression of this laccase in photosynthetic cyanobacteria in a closed bioreactor system, integrated as a part of the wastewater purification process.

The resulted dsDNA is the starting point of a transcription process in the same medium. The newly synthesised RNAs start the process again and again, thus producing a high amount of dsDNA detected by increasing SYBR Green fluorescence. We calibrated a simple fluorimeter and proposed a self-designed and 3D-printed adaptor for PCR tubes as inexpensive hardware for qualitative analysis.

A tumour starts developing asymptomatically, becoming less responsive to therapy by the time of diagnosis. We can detect cancer sooner by screening bodily fluids, such as blood or urea, for presence of tumour-associated biomarkers. These biomarkers include proteins, nucleic acids, and circulating tumour cells. However, a large-scale screening initiative requires a test for a dynamic marker that appears early during the disease and is shared by multiple tumours, such as microRNA (miRNA). Our prototype microfluidic chip, ExoSwitch, makes nucleic acid detection acessible and simple. By utilizing de novo designed RNA machines termed toehold switches, it allows rapid detection of multiple cancer-linked miRNAs. The lab-on-chip technology offers parallel testing for multiple targets and requires minimal equipment to perform the assay. Combining low cost and easy distribution, ExoSwitch can bring accessible tumour screening to patients worldwide.

We are focusing on the surfactant genes Ranaspumin-2 and Latherin which work individually, and the plastic-degrading genes PETase and MHETase which work together. Using Golden Gate assembly, we are creating plasmids containing either surfactant or plastic-degrading genes plus a packaging sequence that allows P1 to take up the plasmid. Once these phages have been successfully produced, we will analyze their lysates with a variety of assays such as the oil spreading assay for measuring surfactant activity and the blue-dye assay for measuring plastic degradation.

Besides, the CRISPRi/dCas9 technique has been applied to regulate the use of carbon to increase the production of gas. Meanwhile, an acid-responsive dynamic control system and a quorum-sensing system has been added to ensure the normal growth of E. coli in a weakly acidic environment. In addition, sucrose-related suiciding system and carbon source utilization system have been introduced into the bacterium to ensure biosafety and meet the demand of household device.

Herein, we are developing a cell-free RNA biosensor which comprises a cell-free system, engineered DNA transcription templates and RNA-responsive CRISPR/Cas9 System. Once the sensor is exposed to specific RNA, the visible outputs from deGFP can be visualized by naked eyes.We hope our project will provide patients with a simple, safe, low-cost diagnostic method.
https://teams.igem.org/3886	High School	There is no denying that synbio is a hugely potential field. But for engineered strains to function beyond laboratories, some obstacles are holding them back. NDNF_China hopes to help these strains work beyond the laboratory in a safe, stable and traceable way. Here we present Hidro: a hydrogel system enclosing engineered bacterial strains. The outer layer of Hidro is a compact shell, offering both protection and containment, preventing the strains from escaping into the wild; the inner core of Hidro provides a supportive environment for them under harsh conditions, thus enabling their stable function; A genome-integrated Tracing and Control system offers tracking and specific killing of engineered strains in case of emergencies. We have experimentally demonstrated that Hidro can be implemented in diverse scenarios, such as heavy metal sensing, food-quality detection, drug secretion, etc. The Hidro system has the great potential to promote synthetic biology applications beyond the laboratory.

In order to improve our environment, we use genetically modified <i>Escherichia coli</i> to produce derivatives of indigo such as 6,6-dibromoindigo, forming indigo dyes without generating large amounts of wastewater and harmful chemicals. In addition, in order to response to the green and sustainable development, we apply 6,6-dibromoindigo on dye-sensitized solar cell to release the heavy load on semiconductor production. Also, this method gives a new way on the synthesis biology and industry engineering.
https://teams.igem.org/3888	High School	Compared with traditional means, biohydrogen production is cost-effective and owns unique environmental advantages. Herein, SJTang modified E. coli and R. palustris, a purple non-sulfur bacterium notable for its hydrogen production ability. In both strains, photosynthetic biohybrid systems are introduced by interfacing iodine-doped hydrothermally carbonized carbon on the cell surface, facilitating photoelectron transduction. Moreover, oxygen-tolerant [NiFe]-hydrogenase is expressed heterologously to enhance versatility and efficiency. Genes encoding for biofilm and uptake hydrogenase in R. palustris were knocked out to maximize yield. Upon modification, the co-culture of E. coli and R. palustris demonstrated a mutualistic relationship in hydrogen production by exchanging essential carbon and nitrogen sources. A low-cost bioreactor capable of fermentation, gas collection, and quantitative component analysis is developed and packed into an integrated open-source solution. Through metabolic modification and hardware innovation, SJTang hopes further to improve hydrogen production efficiency and lower unit costs.
https://teams.igem.org/3889	New Application	The modern contraceptives used at present have improved efficiency, but they have certain drawbacks that need immediate attention both from a human health and environmental perspective. Keeping in mind the importance of contraception globally, we aim to develop a safe and environment-friendly contraceptive for uterus owners by utilizing commensal bacteria of the fallopian tubes. Using synthetic biology, we plan to equip the bacteria with a progesterone sensing system that regulates the production of ovastacin, an ovum-specific human protease. Ovastacin acts as a contraceptive molecule by specifically targeting the outer layer of the ovum to prevent sperm entry. The bacteria is also engineered with a xylose inducible kill switch to ensure reversibility of the contraception and a blue-light inducible kill switch to kill the bacteria upon any environmental release. OviCloak aims to offer its users control over their fertility and uphold their fundamental rights without compromising their health or the environment.
https://teams.igem.org/3890	Environment	Bees are very important for the environment and economy since they are responsible for the pollination of about 70% of crops worldwide. Some crops are completely dependent on bee pollination to exist. Since the 1990s, registers show a decrease in bees populations, associated with multifactorial causes, such as the Colony Collapse Disorder and Acute Intoxication. One of the most worrying causes is the misuse of neonicotinoids pesticides, of which the most used is Imidacloprid. Bees when in contact with contaminated pollen take it to the colony, spreading the toxicity and causing mass deaths. To address this we developed a plant (Solanum lycopersicum) that can metabolize Imidacloprid specifically in pollen. We associated a pollen specific promoter, pLAT52, to the expression of the enzyme CYP6G1, responsible for metabolizing Imidacloprid in the pesticide resistant Drosophila melanogaster. This way pollen remains safe for pollinators while the rest of the plant is protected against pests.

https://teams.igem.org/3892	Village	The world population is consistently growing and integrated agriculture is expanding consequently. As a result, the global need for freshwater is greater than ever and it continues to increase. Accordingly, the world is facing a freshwater crisis that is vastly affecting the agricultural industry in all parts of the world. CyaSalt is an innovative approach to solve this crisis. The aim of the project is to desalinate seawater in an environmentally friendly way using modified phototrophic organisms. These organisms will utilize sunlight to activate the inward-directed chloride pump, Halorhodopsin, that imports chloride ions. Sodium ions will enter via the ion channel MscL. Thereafter, the modified organisms are separated from the desalinated water by a cellulose filter. The organisms bind to the filter via a carbohydrate-binding domain on their surfaces, resulting in desalinated water free from modified bacteria. Hence, CyaSalt provides a sustainable and economically accessible freshwater source for agricultural use.
https://teams.igem.org/3893	Food & Nutrition	Plant diseases are one of the main hazards to agriculture. One out of three Cavendish bananas being eaten every day is produced in Ecuador. Fusarium wilt, caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (FOC) is the major threat to banana cultivars worldwide. AgroBactory 593, is a bacterial platform that produces low-cost biopesticides to fight against plant diseases. By producing and delivering double-stranded RNA molecules as biopesticides, AgroBactory 593 uses RNAi technology to silence expression of specific targets in the pathogen genome. To demonstrate the platforms effectiveness, we made a biopesticide against FOC-TR1 in vitro. Its modular design allows us to easily change the pathogens of interest, adjust the biopesticide level, and select the bacterial chassis. This way, we can optimize and customize our biopesticide providing an accessible solution for farmers and their crops against pests. AgroBactory 593 is a powerful tool to guarantee disease-free and high-quality food for the world.
https://teams.igem.org/3894	Diagnostics	The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) severely struck the whole world. Rapid and convenient detection of pathogenic viruses can facilitate early detections and prevent large outbreaks of viral epidemics, including COVID-19. Here, we developed a G-quadruplex-based, highly specific, expedite and economic RNA virus detection system using SARS-CoV-2 as an example. The procedure includes recombinase-polymerase-mediated viral sequence amplification, nCas9-Phi29-mediated DNA nicking and displacement, rolling cycle amplification of G-quadruplex, and color development. All reactions can be carried out at ambient temperatures with limited requirement of instrument, which allows the method to be used under all circumstances.

We have found keratinases that can decompose the &#945;-keratin in human hair. By incorporating it into a bio-gel, we can produce a product the market has never seen before. We hope that our products can help everyone, and we hope that in the future, everyone can choose our products freely. Of course, we accept all kinds of beauty, hairless or not. As long as we like it, we should advocate social acceptance and respect the aesthetics of all people. In the future, we hope that this technology can be further applied in medical and industrial fields, such as treatment of skin keratinization diseases, treatment of poultry feathers in farms, leather pretreatment, hair treatment of household sewage pipes, etc.
https://teams.igem.org/3896	Diagnostics	In this study, we developed an environmental multivirus detection device based on engineered E. coli to capture coronavirus, such as SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E, to spark fluorescence reporter gene. The PmrCAB system derived from Salmonella was recombined onto the surface of E. coli, and the Fe(III) recognition site of PmrB was replaced with the receptor of targeted coronavirus. Therefore, the bacteria can capture coronavirus via binding to their receptors and transport signaling to the downstream components. LuxI/LuxR quorum sensing system from E. coli and Hrp amplifier from Pseudomonas syringae were used to enhance the sensitivity and output signal. In addition, we also develop an improved air sampler to enrich nanoparticle in air onto engineered E. coli. The implementation of the environmental multivirus detection would be helpful for establish a preventive system in public place, such as hospital and super market.
https://teams.igem.org/3897	High School	Breast cancer is one of the most serious health issues faced by human society. However, its solution remains flawed in many ways, for example, antibody-drug conjugates often cause great side effects; pathway inhibitor drugs rely on specific pathways which sometimes can be bypassed by tumor cells. To tackle these issues, we developed a new drug delivery system consisting of aptamers, nanoparticle, and a model drugsimilar to that of ADC, but applying aptamers rather than an antibody. Moreover, we make modifications throughout the system to further improve the drug's specificity and stability: our aptamers are pH-sensitive, only binding to cancer cells in an acidic tumor environment together with the nanoparticles. We have communicated with experts and modified our project design based on their advice. In addition, we produced card games and documentaries and delivered lectures to increase our project's publicity and promote the significance of synthetic biology in the real world.
https://teams.igem.org/3898	Environment	Wide spreading and utilization of plastic polyethylene terephthalate (PET) in the world has caused serious environmental challenges and gained much attention. In response, microbe Ideonella sakaiensis was reported to be capable of secreting two efficient enzymes to deconstruct PET polymers in mild temperature. However, this two-enzyme system degradation capacity is highly limited by inhibition effects, diffusion of intermediates and PET surface physicochemical properties. Therefore, we design a delicate multicomplex enzyme system, in which short peptide tags (RIAD and RIDD) are applied to create scaffold-free modular enzymes assemblies. In order to effectively degrade microplastic PET particles, we construct enzymes of IsPETase and MHETase and protein hydrophobin in our complex system via scaffold modular part, which reveal higher catalytic efficiency in mild temperature. This work presents an innovative strategy to improve PET degradation via biosynthetic factories and artificially designed proteins system that do not exist in the nature.
https://teams.igem.org/3899	Diagnostics	Colorectal cancer has high incidence across the world and the 5-year survival rate for people with a localized stage colorectal cancer is 90%, but only one third of patients are diagnosed at such stage. This problem persists despite the existence of many screening solutions such as colonoscopy and stool based tests. Our proposed solution is Salica, a non invasive, easy to use home device, that accurately quantifies salivary colorectal cancer biomarkers such as specific strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum and microRNAs. Firstly, the biomarkers are isothermaly amplified using recombinase polymerase amplification and the produced nucleic acids are targeted by the cas12a enzyme. Upon target recognition a fluorescently labeled ssDNA probe is cleaved by cas12a resulting in a colorimetric output that is quantified by a 3d printed smartphone fluorimeter. In the future our system can be adapted to any improved biomarker just by changing only the RPA primers and the cas12a crRNA.
https://teams.igem.org/3900	New Application	As an invisible threat to the environment and human life, remnants of chemical weapons from both world wars still contaminate the soil. In Germany alone, there are over 200 suspected locations. We develop a plant-based detection system for degradation products of chemical weapons that is highly specific and allows cost-efficient screening of large areas while being easy to use. Our plant indicates the presence of toxic chemicals by changing its color to red. For this, we introduce two new reporter systems called RUBY and ANTHOS, enabling the synthesis of the plant pigments betalains or anthocyanins, respectively. If the chemical is present, it is specifically bound by a receptor, which then activates a signaling cascade, resulting in the synthesis of the pigments. Both computational design and site-directed mutagenesis are used to design new receptor proteins. In the future, our plant allows the detection of further chemicals by replacing the specific receptor.

It affects approximately 10% of women worldwide and can take up to 8 years to be diagnosed. Some blood-circulating microRNAs could constitute promising biomarkers as their concentration differs between patients with endometriosis and healthy women. iGEM GO-Paris-Saclay project EndoSeek aims to develop a new diagnostic tool to detect these miRNAs, exploiting the nucleases Cas13a and Cas14a1 and the production of a fluorescent signal that could be measured with a smartphone. We modeled the signal amplification provided by our nuclease cascade and attempted to identify new miRNAs endometriosis biomarkers from a public database using artificial intelligence. We created a video game to inform adults and children above 10 about endometriosis and the possibilities opened by synthetic biology. Finally, following our dialogue with patients and doctors, we questioned the ethical implications linked to diagnoses.
https://teams.igem.org/3903	Environment	Chemical toxins such as octinoxate and oxybenzone, found in many commercially-available sunscreens, contribute to coral reef degradation. To combat this problem, a solution was designed whereby Shinorine, a natural, UV-protecting compound could be synthetically overproduced by probiotic Nissle 1917 E. coli - these bacteria would be combined with a lotion containing a carbon-rich nutrient medium, creating a sustainable, ocean-friendly sunscreen alternative that could be applied directly onto the skin. The aim during the Phase II stage was to clone constitutive genes into plasmids, transform these into BL21 E. coli cells, and finally test for the expression of the enzymes of the Shinorine-producing pathway. ATPG, the initial gene in the Shinorine-producing pathway, was successfully cloned into the pETDuet-1 plasmid, however cloning the other three genes into their plasmids proved difficult. To conclude, it was shown that ATPG can be successfully cloned into the pETDuet-1 plasmid via Gibson assembly.

Although the infection is most common in developing countries, it is relevant to the whole world as travelers and immigrants disseminate the infection. The annual rates, lack of publicly available diagnostic tests, inexistent prevention tools, and deadly consequences of pathogenesis progression have inspired us to create effective prevention and sensitive diagnostic tools to improve the control of this infection. The first solution - probiotic bacteria that synthesize naringenin - a compound that negatively affects the viability of E. histolytica. This would prevent the spread of amebiasis by asymptomatic people and the development of the infection to an invasive form. The second - a rapid diagnostic test, which is based on aptamers and is specific to ameba secreted proteins. This test would enable accurate and specific detection of the invasive E. histolytica infection.

Project Ribotox aims to spread awareness about preeclampsia and to develop a screening tool using microRNA biomarkers twice as early into pregnancy as current methods allow, by detecting two upregulated miRNAs in the serum of patients with the condition with toehold switches, and a novel method of isothermal amplification. This test will be able to take place in a single tube at a single temperature, increasing the accessibility of RNA tests worldwide.

Based on this, this year, we aim to explore the further optimization and upgrading of this plastic pollutant treatment system by means of genetic engineering. The main optimization schemes include: 1) using a dual enzyme (PETase and MHETase) system to achieve more safe and efficient degradation of micro-plastics. 2) Objective to optimize the expression system of enhanced biofilm compound double enzyme and realize the optimal expression scheme of enhanced biofilm, PETase, and MHETase.

This project was inspired by the 2017 Kenow wildfires devastating aftermath in Waterton National Park. The fire created the ideal environment for spotted knapweed to exponentially spread, limiting the resources for native plant species. Biological controls, manual removal, and chemical treatments are presently utilized to combat the infestation. However, these methods can be costly, time consuming or risk affecting local native species. Our project avoids these drawbacks. The bioengineered RNAi system would be delivered to specifically eliminate spotted knapweed by targeting a unique sequence in the Clp protease gene of the plants chloroplast genome. We are using a new one-pot method for siRNA production and will first test our product on Arabidopsis thaliana.

These APP-expressing flies will produce AD-like symptoms, including Amyloid deposits, neuronal loss, axon degeneration, locomotor defect, and cognitive deficits, etc. Furthermore, some potential drugs will be selected to assess this fly AD model. We hope that one day Alzheimer's disease can be controlled and cured, and we are also working hard for this.

Diarrhea in children (>5 years) accounts for approximately 11% of infection-related death. To address this problem, our objective is to develop engineered microbes that regulate water retention through colanic acid biosynthesis, triggered by dehydration cues including intestinal chloride concentration and pathogenic bacterium quorum sensing molecules (QSM). Pathogenic microbes release QSMs during severe dehydration, resulting in protective biofilm formation. We further include the triggered release of broad-spectrum antimicrobial peptides to displace the diarrhea-causing pathogens. As a case study, we selected Vibrio cholera as it is one of the major global causes of diarrhea. Due to the genetic circuit modularity, we can readily modify the quorum sensing module to target other pathogenic bacteria. The aim is to create broad-spectrum, cost-effective, readily accessible and convenient methods of diarrhea management.

SARS-CoV-2 is RNA virus with high glycosylation of its S protein in which the mutation of S1 proteinand the RBD can arouse the infectivity of the virus to alter and even lead to immunologic escape. Known that the receptor ACE2 is highly conservative, the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody targeting ACE2 had already been proved the ability to restrict its replication inside or outside human body without affecting the activity of ACE2.

https://teams.igem.org/3923	Therapeutics	Osteogenesis imperfecta is a group of genetic disorders that results in brittle bones due to improper collagen formation. In osteoblasts of OI patients, the Wnt signalling pathway is inhibited by sclerostin via binding to LRP5/6 co-receptors, thus lowering beta-catenin concentrations, gene expression and thus bone formation. Suppressing sclerostin by a sclerostin antibody has been shown to enhance bone mass and bone strength. However, in phase III clinical trials, the antibody also imposes severe cardiac ischemic events and worsen cardiovascular diseases in OI patients. Ostamer, our therapeutic aptamer, tackles this development via selectively binding and inhibiting loop3 of sclerostin in order to prevent sclerostin from binding to the osteoblast receptors for treatment of osteogenesis imperfecta, as well as to preserve sclerostin's secondary role as a cardiovascular regulator. Our Ostamer has received US FDA Orphan Drug Designation in 2019 in response to successful clinical testing on OI mice.

These two enzymes promote the production of NAD+ and balances the NAD+/NADH ratio which is disturbed by the metabolism of ethanol and acetaldehyde to ensure adequate energy supply to the reactions. Alcohol is known to bring great damage to the organs, especially the liver. Worse, many East Asians carry mutated genes that result in even more accumulation of acetaldehyde, a toxic substance. According to WHO, three million people worldwide die from harmful use of alcohol every year, which represents 5.3 % of all deaths., Therefore, we believe that alcohol poisoning is a serious issue and should be resolved as soon as possible.

Acidification and salinization caused by excessive use of chemical fertilizer will damage soil structure and lead to soil hardening and compaction. Rhizobia is a type of bacteria widely found in roots soil. In our project, we aim to solve the soil salinization and acidification problem by using the denitrification effect of rhizobia to reduce the adverse consequences of soil hardening. Many rhizobia have the ability of denitrification by decomposing nitrates. We enhanced the denitrification ability of rhizobia by introducing plasmids containing nirK or napA genes, which code for key enzymes in denitrification. This new strain of rhizobium can not only fix nitrogen but also break it down to release the fixed nitrogen from the soil. Furthermore, we also studied the promoter that can sense nitrate concentration, which laid a foundation for the self-initiated denitrification of rhizobia under high nitrate concentration environment.

As Singapore moves to accomplish the national goal of locally producing 30% of its food consumption by 2030, the demand for suitable pest control in the ever-increasing number of farms will surge. Synthetic pesticides are still considered the gold standard in pest control. However, concerns with the negative environmental/health effects of synthetic pesticides limits their use. Biological antimicrobial peptides have been identified as potential substitutes, however, with current Bioproduction methods it is economically infeasible to produce such compounds for use as bio-pesticides. This project aims to produce Human Beta Defensin (as an exemplar) using a more cost effective approach for use as a bio-bactericide/fungicide at the farms. This is achieved through the development an optogenetically controlled yeast chassis and an open-source bioreactor designed for the chassis.

About 80% of the finite phosphate-containing rocks mined, is used in crop fertilizers and with the current rate of consumption the phosphorus sources might be depleted in less than a century. Our aim was to design a mediator organism that effectively regulates processes involved in phosphate solubilization and therefore increases the phosphate uptake efficiency of plants. We created the Phos4us system, which makes use of an already existent phosphate regulation pathway in Escherichia coli to react to high inorganic phosphate levels in the soil and produces the quorum sensing molecule 3OC6HSL. This signal allows the cell to actively communicate with neighboring microorganisms, which in return respond with growth and solubilization of the abundant phosphate.
https://teams.igem.org/3929	New Application	Nanobodies are proteins that selectively bind to an antigen. Due to its smaller size, they present advantages in diagnosis and therapeutics. However, they are animal-derived, expensive and difficult to produce. Complementary determining regions or CDRs (CDR1, CDR2, CDR3) are unique nanobody regions involved in antigen binding. However, even nanobodies that bind to the same antigen have different binding affinities, as they present different CDRs. Our goal is creating a library of artificially developed nanobodies that bind to a specific antigen. Inspired by nature, this is achieved by random in-vitro recombination of the different CDR genetic sequences of already characterized nanobodies that bind to said antigen. These newly formed nanobody gene fragments are expressed in E. coli, generating a library for the screening of nanobodies with higher binding affinity than the starting ones. This way, our system improves the traditional method for nanobody production, being faster, cheaper and cruelty-free.

UV is potentially damaging to DNA, RNA, proteins, and generates oxidative stress. Therefore, it will be essential to engineering improved photoprotection mechanisms that enhance the performance of the light-harvesting machinery and UV-protection. This project aims to design strategies that endow plants with sunscreens that protect them from harmful UV effects in harsh planetary environments. The proposed solution is to construct a series of Biobricks with UVR8 and PAP1 Arabidopsis genes that allow GoldenBraid assembly of different transcriptional units to produce UV-resistant plants.
https://teams.igem.org/3932	Therapeutics	Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a gram negative spiral shaped microaerophilic bacteria that resides in the stomachs of almost half the world population. Its pathogenic effect due to numerous virulence factors lead to various gastric pathologies including peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer. Although it has been established since 1982, we are facing some treatment challenges especially regarding the biofilm formation and its role in antibiotic resistance. So, we engineer an E. coli, specifically E. coli Nissle 1917, a probiotic strain to be able to chase the H. pylori, disperse its biofilm using a protease: Proteinase-K, and kill the H. pylori using a antimicrobial peptide, PGLa-AM1.
https://teams.igem.org/3933	Diagnostics	Vitamin B12 (VB12) deficiency is a common and prevalent condition which can engender neurological and hematological abnormalities. However, current measurements of VB12 level are usually erratic and lack sensitivity. Here, we offer a portable and easy-to-use bioelectronic sensor for assessing the VB12 level in the blood. This home health monitoring device is similar to those that evaluate blood sugar level, with finger-prick testing. Our biosensor uses a modified bacterial co-culture to produce electricity in the presence of VB12. More specifically, a genetically modified Escherichia coli carries a vitamin B12 riboswitch which controls the biosynthesis of lactate. The latter is subsequently metabolized by Shewanella oneidensis to produce a reducing potential. Shewanella oneidensis has the prodigious ability to reduce metal ions, so when it is in contact with an anode it is possible to create electricity. Your B12 levels needs to be kept in check? Use Cobatect !
https://teams.igem.org/3934	WIKI	Cultivated meat is produced from animal cells grown in a bioreactor with enriching growth media to meet the growing demand for meat. This innovation in the food industry aims to solve some of the worlds most pressing global crises such as mass animal slaughter, climate change, deforestation and emerging pandemics. Among all the essentials needed for the growth media, FGF2 or bFGF, basic fibroblast growth factor, is one of the most expensive. This is due to its unstable and short-acting characteristics but most importantly, its production cost. We aimed to improve a number of FGF2 properties that include binding affinity to its receptor, thermal stability and solubility. We designed three such mutants of wild-type FGF2, with each variant being successfully expressed and purified. Some of them were scaled up further. Our long-term goal is to be able to offer an improved growth factor to industry.
https://teams.igem.org/3935	New Application	SARS-CoV-2, the causal agent of COVID-19 pandemic, caused over 200,000 deaths globally in the first 4 months. Overcoming this pandemic is a great challenge for humanity and it is still a main concern for the scientific communities worldwide. We decided to develop an edible vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 aiming to be a more accessible and easily distributed alternative to conventional vaccines. To create this vaccine, we designed a synthetic gene that expresses specific SARS-CoV-2 antigens into plant cells. Our synthetic construct codes for a chimeric tripartite Spike S1 protein that covers three distinct mutants of SARS-CoV-2. Using the agroinfiltration method we produce high levels of the chimeric S1-protein at the lettuce cells membrane. This antigen protein will specifically activate the Mucosal Immunity in lab animals upon consuming of the plant tissue. This is the first step of our vaccine development that will be followed by the immunization of lab mice.

This project uses Bacillus subtilis, which is generally considered safe, as a carrier to assemble aflatoxin degradation proteins, stable-phase promoters and self-cleavage protein. Combined with the selenium-enrichment function of Bacillus subtilis, a strain of intelligent Bacillus subtilis with self cleavage function, which can simultaneously degrade aflatoxin and enrich selenium, is constructed. Finally, a new, safe and selenium rich high-value feed additive is provided.
https://teams.igem.org/3938	High School	Nowadays, consumers' demand for fresh fish is sharply increasing. In the process of cultivation, transportation or storage and the spoilage caused by microbial invasion will affect the health of the fish itself and consumers. Pseudomonas Aeruginosa is an important pathogen of fish, which can lead to corruption of fish and health problems of consumers. In order to reduce these risks demonstrated, a rapid detection of corruption is needed. Our project aimed to use structure switching fluorescence method to verify the existing aptamer found in papers that specifically bind AHLs, the quorum sensing signals of P.aeruginosa. After the verification, we found the aptamers can specifically bind to AHLs based on which we successfully constructed an aptamer-based lateral flow test strip. At last, we accomplished the final version of the test trips that was more portable, rapid and efficient for practical application scenarios.
https://teams.igem.org/3939	Foundational Advance	As the carrier of genetic information, chromosomes are vital to cells and even life. Most of the time, we cannot imagine what would happen to a cell without chromosomes. However, like Monkey King's curse in Journey to the West, chromosomes sometimes can be a burden to the cells. In our project, we have gotten out of the rut to create the CREATE&#65288;Chromosome Released Eukaryote which is Active, Transitory and Environment-friendly&#65289;, a yeast without chromosomes. Such cells have no chromosomes and cannot proliferate, but endogenous enzymes still remain active for a certain period of time. Taking advantage of these characteristics, CREATE might be a much safer bio-reactor used in drug delivery and gene therapy. Obviously, the applications of CREATE will never be limited to any certain field. We believe that CREATE has great potential to be applied in more fields deeply and widely.
https://teams.igem.org/3940	Environment	Lithium-ion batteries are one of the most common batteries used in the 21st century, particularly for electric cars. When their lifespan is over, metals especially found in their cathodes, such as lithium, cobalt, and nickel, should be recycled both to avoid contamination and to regain these valuable materials for further usage. LiCoO2, their main component, can be separated by chemical/biological leaching process, and the remaining cobalt metal can be used for different purposes, in our case for vitamin B12 (a.k.a. cobalamin) synthesis. Although the demand for cobalamin has been increasing, its commercial production is still time-consuming and inefficient. Our purpose is to enhance the Vitamin B12 synthesis by improving the efficiency of rate limiting-step in the pathway via enzyme scaffold systems. Besides, by using the cobalt ions from waste lithium-ion batteries for B12 synthesis we aim to increase B12 production and decrease the waste of lithium-ion batteries.
https://teams.igem.org/3941	High School	Water pollution caused by paper waste is a huge ecological problem. Cellulose, a polysaccharide, is the main compound of paper products and can be degraded by cellulases; primarily performing hydrolysis of the 1,4-beta-D-glycosidic linkages to produce monosaccharides, smaller polysaccharides and oligosaccharides (2,3). In this project, we aimed to find a biological solution to water pollution caused by paper contaminants. For this purpose, we used endoglucanase II enzyme from Trichoderma reesei and removed the linker region, CBM domain and the signal peptide from the gene (BBa_K3941001). Additionally, for the purpose of increase enzyme activity, we designed 2 mutant forms of this enzyme and conducted experiments (BBa_K3941003 and BBa_K3941002). For the same purpose, we also worked on the catalytic region of CelAB cellulase (BBa_K3941000) which produced from Teredinibacter turnerae. The results of this project promise that paper contaminated waters can be cleaned much more effectively and eco-friendly by using cellulases.
https://teams.igem.org/3942	Therapeutics	Our team propose a new method of targeted RNA delivery to tumour cells using membrane-derived extracellular vesicles with fusion proteins. The endogenous retroviral gene syncytin-1 was selected as a fusion protein to enhance fusional properties with the target cells. Its receptors (ASCT2) are found on some tumors cells, for example, colorectal adenocarcinoma. Using fusion protein, vesicles overcome the potential membrane barrier. In our iGEM project, we were focused on the sorting and targeted delivery of mRNA (GFP and b-galoxidase, reporter genes) to tumour cells. For mRNA sorting we used RNA-binding domain (N domain of gag protein), which can recognize the psi-packaging signal of the HIV1. The mRNA will be associated with the psi-signal, and RNA-construction (target mRNA+psi-signal) will be recognized by the gag protein. Currently, there are no analogs of such systems in the world, so our technology might become a breakthrough in the field of targeted drug delivery techniques.

https://teams.igem.org/3944	Manufacturing	Fatty acid-based compounds act as important building blocks in many industrial processes. Currently, many of these compounds are obtained through costly and energy inefficient chemical synthesis using base oils. Vegetable oils are promising alternatives, but many of these are drivers of deforestation and biodiversity loss. Finding alternative ways to produce the building blocks that make up the products we use every single day, is a key step in the development of a bio-based economy. We propose that Saccharomyces cerevisiae can be engineered for the production of high-value fatty acid-based compounds in a tunable fashion. We aim to fine-tune reaction pathways in vivo that can be difficult to carry out using conventional chemical synthesis. By downregulating the native fatty acid synthesis and introducing a bacterial system, we can regulate the production profiles using three types of thioesterases linked to different induction systems.
https://teams.igem.org/3945	Environment	Rare earth elements (REEs) possess unique physical and chemical properties that make them an essential component of many everyday technologies, such as cellphones, televisions, and automobiles. Presently, REEs are not mined sustainably, and current trends indicate that an alternate source is critical to avoid a period of REE scarcity. Neocycle is a system that works to selectively recover REEs from an underutilized source, electronic waste. First, REE extraction is necessary through the process of bioleaching, where the acid-producing organisms Gluconobacter oxydans and Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans, solubilize the electronic waste feedstock. Next, REEs are recovered from the e-waste leachate through the use of the novel lanthanide-ion binding protein, lanmodulin, in an adsorption column system. Finally, the recovered REE ions are measured using one of three novel measurement systems, which are based on lanmodulin fusion proteins. Through this pipeline, Neocycle aims to provide a sustainable and more accessible source of REEs.
https://teams.igem.org/3946	Manufacturing	We aim to revolutionise the extraction of valuable materials from the most common recalcitrant waste polymers, including cellulose, keratin, chitin and PET. These are all resistant to natural biodegradation but hold great potential for integration to the circular economy. Current treatments are often unsustainable, requiring harmful chemicals, high energy and resulting in downcycling of materials to lower value products. Our team seeks to combine physical and enzymatic treatment of these polymers by constructing a Super Grinder, featuring enzymes immobilised on silica beads using silica-binding tags. These enzyme-laden silica beads both contribute to the physical grinding mechanism and theoretically ensure that enzymes will have greater access to the substrate surface. Immobilisation may have the added benefits of improving enzyme stability and recyclability, and our design operates at ambient temperatures, decreasing its carbon footprint and cost. We also aim to improve enzyme efficiency using directed evolution techniques.
https://teams.igem.org/3947	Environment	Over the last 100 years, the human population has exploded and so has the demand for food sources such as meat. To keep up with this demand, the number of cows has also skyrocketed. Cows have multiple stomachs, one of them being the rumen. Within it, there exists a microcosm of microorganisms of which the archaea, specifically the suborder, Methanobrevibacter, creates methane (CH4) by using the fermentation byproducts H2 and CO2. Methane, a greenhouse gas, has a global warming potential that is 28 times stronger per unit mass relative to CO2. To tackle this issue our team is producing a microbial feed additive for cows which will express a set of proteins, derived from different species of red seaweed, to inhibit the metabolic pathway of CH4 production by producing a compound called bromoform.
https://teams.igem.org/3948	Manufacturing	Methanotrophic bacteria have garnered significant interest for their biotechnology potential in the valorization of squandered CH4 obtained from natural gas and anaerobic digestion-derived biogas. Recently, it was reported that the methanotroph Methylococcus capsulatus has dual one-carbon assimilation capacity, fixing carbon dioxide (CO2), the most abundant GHG), in addition to CH4, making this an ideal biocatalyst for the conversion of biogas that consists of a mix of CH4 and CO2. The goal of this project was to engineer an M. capsulatus biocatalyst with the capacity to convert CH4 and CO2 into gamma- aminobutyric acid (GABA), a precursor to nylon-4. Two biosynthetic pathways for 1) increased flux to the GABA precursor, glutamate, and 2) GABA synthesis and export were designed, constructed, and expressed in M. capsulatus to enable GHG conversion to GABA.

SNflaPs further explores the extent to which our method is effective in detecting single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Inspired by the needs of local farmers, the goal of this project is to demonstrate that a detection panel of SNP caused diseases is a feasible one. This is done by amplifying genomic DNA through recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) and employing a 5 flap endonuclease (Flappase) that cleaves Holliday junctions created by designed oligonucleotides with flurophore tagged ends.
https://teams.igem.org/3953	Diagnostics	Contributing factors to high mortality rates of Colorectal Cancers (CRC) in the United States are associated with the cost and inefficiencies with colonoscopies as the initial detection method. Here we propose the development of a detection system utilizing engineered E.coli cells to produce a color change in the presence of CRC tumors and adenocarcinomas. To colonize colorectal cells, we have proposed engineering E. coli cells with chimeric fimbrial cap protein that can be anchored to surfaces. Anchoring occurs via interaction with customized antigens using a SNAP tag. We then sense a hypoxic environment in cancer cells through the oxidative stress response transcription factor OxyR. To achieve this goal, we designed and built plasmids in which OxyR promoters regulate the transcription of the B-galactosidase lac-alpha fragment. Finally, the lac-alpha released forms a complex with lac-omega resulting in functional B-galactosidase that can be used in colorimetric assays reporting OxyR mediated transcription.
https://teams.igem.org/3954	Environment	Pharmaceutical pollution is a major problem that threatens the integrity of Lake Michigan, the largest freshwater lake in the world. One such pollutant is triclosan, a commonly found antifungal and antibacterial agent. While current wastewater treatment plants are able to separate this molecule from water, it is often incorporated in sludge and used as compost where it can find its way back into our waterways. Thats why UChicagos iGem project hopes to create an optimized enzyme called LACCXA that can chemically degrade triclosan, thus completely eliminating this pollutant rather than physically moving it to another location. Using the laccase from the fungus Trametes versicolor as a template, we employed molecular dynamics simulations from GROMACS to analyze active site binding activity at wastewater treatment plan conditions to inform potential mutations that optimize laccase functionality.
https://teams.igem.org/3955	Therapeutics	Amyloidogenic neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimers and Parkinsons, are expected to increase as life expectancy rises. Recent studies in rodents, correlated curli biofilms in the gut, and plaque buildup in the brain. To prevent neurodegenerative diseases, we aimed to express potential curli inhibitors via a probiotic chassi, Limosilactobacillus reuteri, and investigate the impact of the inhibitors in the presence of curli-producing bacteria. We applied gibson assembly and restriction enzyme cloning to attempt to insert our inhibitor genes into an L. reuteri expression vector. However, most likely due to our chosen selection marker, transformations were unsuccessful. During the last weeks, we successfully inserted one construct into pET11a, yet with an inconclusive expression assay. Our conclusion is that further studies of curli inhibition is required, preferably choosing a more suitable vector and chassi for expression. The connection between curli formation in the gut and amyloids in the brain also requires further investigation.

While most commercial collagen come from bovine sources, the derivation process is both unethical and poses significant health concerns such as arsenic poisoning and zoonotic diseases. To combat these environmental and ethical concerns, as well as extend research into recombinant collagen technology, Collagene was developed, making functional triple-helical collagen for regenerative medicine. A bacterial collagen called Scl2 was expressed in yeast and E. coli via gap repair cloning in order to create a blank template of collagen that is highly adaptable to various research uses. In addition, we tested a wide variety of biomedical gels and threads that could be used during surgery or woven to replace blood vessels, developing our own wet-spinner for Collagene threads.
https://teams.igem.org/3957	Diagnostics	The synthesis of vitamin D primarily occurs in the skin upon exposure to UV light. In northern climates with fluctuating sunlight levels, vitamin D insufficiency (< 50 nmol/L) is common. In Canada, 33% of the population experiences insufficiency. Current testing methods in northern British Columbia, Canada, are expensive, time-consuming, and inaccessible. A benchtop vitamin D biosensor that can be implemented in local healthcare facilities would address this problem. Our biosensor will detect vitamin D (25(OH)D) in a blood serum sample. The biosensor is contained in E. coli, and consists of two components: (i) 1-alpha-hydroxylase, and (ii) a chimeric protein consisting of the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of vitamin D receptor and a FRET system (VDR-FRET). The 1-alpha-hydroxylase activates 25(OH)D to 1,25(OH)2D, which has high affinity for the VDR-LBD. Binding of 1,25(OH)2D to the VDR-FRET protein results in an altered fluorescent signal.

https://teams.igem.org/3962	WIKI	A major challenge in synthetic biology is the containment of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) outside of the laboratory. This includes restraining the physical spread of the organism and transfer of synthetic genes, via horizontal gene transfer (HGT). This challenge remains as regulatory bodies require sound evidence on the safety of GMOs which is difficult due to the lack of knowledge upon release. Additionally, the absence of risks is not necessarily a definitive proof of safety. Therefore, industry is unwilling to invest and scientists only rarely get permission to gather large-scale data. Here, DOPL LOCK can make the difference: we propose a mutually dependent double plasmid lock which will minimize HGT and the spread of GMOs. Our goal is to provide an open-source, standardised, modular and widely applicable Safe-by-Design biocontainment system of GMOs in non-contained applications. With DOPL LOCK, we aim to drive bio-safety innovations, accelerating the field of synthetic biology.

Our method should be able to treat diseases without changing the composition of the microbiome by giving it new capabilities. We use the natural competency of specific bacteria to take up DNA from their environment. Our idea is to deliver transforming DNA into the intestine to be taken up by these bacteria. Our drylab team processes microbiome 16s rRNA data to find natural competent bacteria. In the laboratory, we performed natural transformation of Acinetobacter baylyi. Additionally we tested the efficiency of phenylalanine lyase and demonstrated that it degrades phenylalanine in gut microbiome related bacteria species. Furthermore, we discussed novel natural selection advantages because antibiotics are no possibility in a patient. Between certain sugar catabolism, beta-glucosidase was the most promising.

We found that microbial fuel cells (MFCs) can degrade aureomycin by Fenton reaction through modification of the cathode. At the same time, to improve the degradation rate, we aim to localize a biofilm to the cell anode as biofilm activity is closely related to the efficiency of microbial fuel cells. By overexpressing the quorum sensing system in the electricity-producing bacteria, we greatly improved the efficiency of the fuel cell and thus the degradation efficiency of aureomycin.

Photoautotrophic microbial biomass is a promising alternative to produce renewable carbon feedstocks for chemical synthesis. We have cultured previously engineered cyanobacteria, S. elongatus UTEX 2973, which can recycle carbon dioxide as secreted sucrose. Parallelly, we have engineered butanol-producing E. coli KJK01 to consume sucrose as a carbon source. Growing the two organisms together in a co-culture would allow for a sustainable, single-step, single-pot conversion of carbon dioxide into biobutanol. Our in silico models probed the stability and dynamics of the co-culture system to identify optimal conditions for the production of butanol. We used genome-scale metabolic models to identify key gene deletion and overexpression targets to improve butanol and sucrose yields. Furthermore, we designed constructs to characterise the strengths of native promoters to boost sucrose secretion in cyanobacteria.

Globally over 6 million people suffer from IBD, and this number keeps rising. The current monitoring procedure for this disease lacks specificity, resulting in unnecessary follow-up examinations that are invasive, expensive, and time-consuming, which calls for an alternative procedure. Our solution, IBDetection, consists of a pill that can be ingested orally by the patient and delivers live, safe, genetically engineered Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) to the intestine. These bacteria include a biorthogonal sensing cascade to detect tetrathionatean inflammation biomarkerwith high specificity, and in turn activates translation of acoustic reporter genes, resulting in the formation of gas vesicles in the bacteria. These gas vesicles can then be measured outside of the body using conventional ultrasound equipment. This method provides a cost-effective, easy-to-use solution to rule out unnecessary follow-up examinations in a specific and non-invasive manner using fast imaging methods.

To mitigate these complications, we have designed a platform technology known as Manifold that sequesters and spatially organizes synthetic, zinc finger-bound enzymes on dsDNA scaffolds inside bacterial microcompartments. Here we detail our progress toward a resveratrol-producing, proof-of-concept device built using the Manifold framework, and present adaptable models which further the utility of Manifold to metabolic engineers.

https://teams.igem.org/3979	Therapeutics	Opportunistic fungal infections like mucormycosis, aspergillosis, and candidiasis have ravaged immunocompromised patients battling multiple comorbidities. Tackling these infections has been difficult due to a limited repertoire of expensive antifungal drugs and their side effects. Moreover, the rampant use of these limited numbers of drugs raises the alarming possibility of developing drug-resistant fungal strains. Chitinases are potent natural biocontrol agents against fungi. We aim to engineer chimeric chitinases with a specific combination of different chitin-binding and catalytic domains from wild-type chitinases that will have increased anti-fungal activity. The antifungal enzymes thus synthesized could be developed into effective therapeutic agents against invasive fungal infections.
https://teams.igem.org/3980	High School	The issue of heavy metal pollution in aquatic systems is a very serious problem for both our future and present. This problem manifests itself in different ways all over the world. Although it affects the food chain and the life cycle negatively; the studies carried out until today, including methods where external intervention is mandatory, could only provide a temporary solution to the problem. We aim to reduce the percentage of heavy metals in water by using gene transfer methods and gene cloning, without disturbing the natural balance. This is possible by a system that will be added to the natural habitat. In this project, we studied how to use the bioremediator properties of algae without causing eutrophication. Based on this idea, we obtained transgenic E.coli which contains the heavy metal removal genes of algae. With our study, we as Istanbul United, can reduce heavy metal pollution permanently.
https://teams.igem.org/3981	Therapeutics	Breast cancer has overtaken lung cancer as the most frequently diagnosed cancer according to Cancer Statistics 2020. Expression of HER2 leads to poor prognosis in 30% of breast cancer. Though there are effective approaches for targeting HER2 such as trastuzumab for breast cancer patients, it is often associated with toxicity and resistance. New treatment strategies are, therefore, urgently needed. In this project, we decided to modify the probiotic E. coli Nissle 1917 to induce the expression of the HER2 artificial antibody and sTRAIL fusion protein in hypoxia, which can kill cancer cells. We demonstrated that sTRAIL fusion protein with trimerization structure could induce apoptosis in HER2-positive breast cancer cells. The modified strain with hypoxia-inducible promoter could express the fusion protein in low oxygen environment and induce apoptosis of breast cancer cells. Our result suggests that the probiotic we designed and engineered would be a potential novel treatment for breast cancer.
https://teams.igem.org/3982	Village	In our project, we aim to make a rapid molecular diagnostic kit for early detection of TB and MDR-TB. Our diagnostic kit will first detect the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the sample via LAMP colorimetric assay. Along with detecting the presence of TB, it will also provide DNA fragments for mutation analysis for MDR-TB detection. Studies have shown the formidable ability of Cas14 to detect SNPs. We intend to use this property to detect the key MDR-TB mutations through specially designed guide RNA. The gRNA will act against the selected genes and analyze the results by detecting the fluorescence triggered by Cas14 complex. We propose to use an integrated hardware device for detecting the fluorescence emission which will also give the final diagnostic report. Our ultimate goal is to reduce the cost of diagnosis and provide a point-of-care system and make our kit accessible to most of the patients.
https://teams.igem.org/3983	High School	Depression, a common mood disorder that brings sadness and emptiness to people, often remains untreatable and requires a treatment method with minimal side effects to alleviate the pain of patients. Current treatment methods of depression are either ineffective or have side effects on patients physiological functioning. Through bioengineering, our team presents a novel method to reduce the severity of depression and, as our name indicates, brings light to patients dark world. We inserted efeB, a gene that can reduce oxidative stress, into a constructed plasmid and placed the gene into bacteria for more effective treatment purposes. Tests show that bacteria with constructed plasmid can suppress the level of MDA under 20 mmol/mg and can survive better than the bacteria without this plasmid under high hydrogen peroxide condition. Our team believes that our product can bring effectual treatment to depression.
https://teams.igem.org/3984	Village	The increasing in antibiotics resistance slowly become a global concern. While, conventional methods to degrade antibiotics like high temperature composting, fermentation and microbial degradation had relatively low efficiency and high costs. More effective methods are urgently needed to cease this global issue. Our group had invest in the field and found out that the whole Cell Biocatalyst Ecn-IL, which is renowned for its practicability, strong stability and low-resources demand, can be a favorable solution to the mentioned issue. Firstly, the utilization of the Ecn-Il can effectively avoid the accumulation of the antibiotics in animals. Without the mountainous usages of antibiotics, the tolerability can be largely reduced, thus the formation of the super-bacteria can also be avoided. With the technology of cell surface display (EcN-IL), the Laccase gene lacc6 be displayed on the surface of Probiotic Escherichia coli, Nissle 1917 (EcN), can be used to degrade antibiotics residues.
https://teams.igem.org/3985	New Application	Biofilm formation is an important characteristic of many bacteria, which enables them to survive under harsh conditions. Nowadays, biofilms are essential for a variety of industrial applications such as food fermentation or wastewater treatment. This year, our team is working on a self-defensive biofilm to protect it from pathogen invasion. We will biologically engineer our biofilm prototype chassis Bacillus subtilis&#8239;to automatically sense pathogens threatening the biofilm via quorum sensing (QS) signalling molecules. The PHIRE BYRD gene circuit will trigger the production of lytic bacteriophages in presence of pathogens. The phages will then selectively kill the pathogenic bacteria while being completely harmless to humans, hence providing a powerful alternative to antibiotics. Finally, our complementary QS based kill-switch will protect our system from unintentional release of GMOs into the environment. By building on synthetic biology principles of modularity and standardization, our self-defensive biofilm system will be easily expandable to multiple pathogenic bacteria.
https://teams.igem.org/3986	High School	Selenium is an essential element of human body. It plays a role to maintain body health, boost immunity, resist cancer, poisoning heavy metal and oxidation. However, Se is in deficiency in large areas, which has caused health problems among more than 1.1 billion people. The lack and the excess of this element both cause health problems. The existing preparation methods of Se are unstable and not safe enough. Thus, micro-biosynthesis of SeNPs, which is easy to absorb, is a way to use this mineral efficiently and safely. In our study, the new found selenite reductive SerV01 expressed in Staphylococcus aureus LZ-01 can convert Se (IV) to SeNPs, which has the potential to be used as a booster for the production of selenium supplements.

In the co-culture, E. coli (Strain BL21-DE3) is engineered to express PETase and MHETase enzymes, as well as absorb sucrose secreted by S. elongatus as its energy source. The enzymes facilitate the degradation of PET into its monomers - terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol, which can then be repurposed in the creation of new bioplastics to maintain a circular and greener supply chain.
https://teams.igem.org/3989	New Application	Crop loss caused by phytopathogens is a severe threat to world food security. However, the extensive use of synthetic pesticides has led to toxicity and resistance emergence. Here, we propose an alternative solution to combat pathogens, by using bacterial membrane vesicles to boost plant immunity. We first screened for strains producing large amounts of highly immunogenic outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). By displaying immune elicitors on the surface of OMVs, the protective immune response can be further enhanced. Meanwhile, we also designed bacteria to function in situ, which can sense pathogens and automatically generate OMVs to prime plants. In addition to OMVs, bacterial cytoplasmic membrane vesicles (CMVs) are engineered to deliver cargoes (e.g., DNA) into plant cells. Our results show that engineered bacterial membrane vesicles can improve disease resistance, as well as other agronomic traits of plants, which might open the door for a new era of biopesticides and biostimulants.
https://teams.igem.org/3990	High School	As one of the most popular groceries, chewing gum is stuck on the table, bench, and street because of irresponsible disposal. Primarily made up of ethyl-vinyl acetate, polyisobutylene and polyisoprene, they are not water-soluble or easily degraded. Removal is generally achieved by steam jet and scraper, but the process is slow and labour-intensive. Other environmental and health problems could also be caused by discarded gum. This year, SMS_Shenzhen aims at fighting against chewing gum. We focus on LCP and laccase in wet lab, expressing them and improving them by directed evolution and rational design. In dry lab, our modelling project optimizes laccase's enzyme activity and verifies the improvement quantitatively. Outside the lab, we conduct stakeholder interviews to collect suggestions for our hardware design. We also organize all-aged education, including lectures and an art exhibition, to raise the public's awareness of protecting the environment and introduce the audience to synthetic biology.

So what we need to do is find a more efficient way to detect the presence and the amount of arsenic around us. In this case, we design to combine the arsA, arsD, and arsR genes to make up the ARS operon pattern which could respond to the presence of arsenic. Afterward, we use green fluorescent proteins to ring the alarm by glowing. We hope our project could promote the public awareness of arsenic threat and provide a better solution to detect arsenic.

It can enter the child's body in the form of oral liquid, capsule, drink, etc. The oral form can facilitate rotavirus patients' treatment and prevent children from developing resistance. In this project, the construction and characterization of the plasmids for oral rotavirus vaccine production were completed in order to prepare the target vaccine. Genes for the &#946; subunit of the heat-labile enterotoxin (LTB) from E. coli and the immunodominant outer core protein VP7 were cloned and expressed as a fusion protein. After being introduced into Bacillus subtilis, the plasmid could recognize rotavirus and express antigens LTB-VP7 successfully.

https://teams.igem.org/3993	High School	Tropane alkaloid-derived medicines are under supply shortage, but growing demand. The extraction of putrescine from plants was time-consuming and low yields, which is seen as a vital limiting factor of tropane alkaloids production. Our project aims at genetically modifying yeast to efficiently produce putrescine in large quantities. On one hand, we designed to introduce the spe1gene to over-express the enzyme that catalyzes the reaction producing putrescine from ornithine. On the other hand, we also introduced two other genes, AsADC derived from oats and speB derived from E. coli which could produce enzymes catalyzing the reaction producing putrescine from arginine. All above will make the yeast a factory to continuously biosynthetic putrescine to support tropane alkaloids production.

We are now hoping to find out a way that can make us easier to detect this kind of disease. Therefore, we are working on the development of a new diagnosis way called the Tetrathionate-Nitrate Test. We will construct an engineered probiotic which could be sent to the patients stomach with the sugar-coated and detect the presence of these two kinds of chemicals: Tetrathionate and Nitrate, the marker of IBD. This will trigger the probiotics to produce fluorescent substances when detecting both makers. As a doctor, IBD could be diagnosed by checking if there is the fluorescent phenomenon in patients excrement which is fast, convenient, and precise.

One way we thought could solve this problem is to use the gene-editing method to edit the yeast when fermenting wheat starch, that way it can accelerate the efficiency of the process when producing alcohol. We edit the genes of xylanase, &#946;-xylosidase, and acetyl-xylan esterase into the yeast, therefore the gene edited yeast can process these three enzymes by themself. Each kind of enzymes role is to break down the polymer of carbohydrate chain in the starch, so the yeast can use the monosaccharides to produce alcohol. Overall, The gene-edited yeast could reduce the cost of alcohol production and take advantage of wheat B starch.

Unfortunately, for some people, its hard for them to digest certain kinds of flavones, which is detrimental to their health. In this project, we put FLR gene into E. coli to produce a strain secreting FLR enzyme. The strain degrades flavonoids to produce DAT and stimulate the immune system to achieve the purposes of anti-inflammatory, antibacterial and anti-cancer. Through this project, we hope to help those people assimilate certain flavones and improve their physical state.

Electrophysiological experiments will be carried out on RIN14 cells to screen out compounds that could effectively stimulate RIN14B cells for the preparation of anti-depression drugs in the future. On the other hand, we also plan to recombine the Escherichia coli system, which could secret TPH and TDC enzyme to further exogenously synthesize 5-HT with tryptophan as the transformation substrate. This work is aiming to prepare engineered probiotics to ease depression. We hope to help patients who suffer from different levels of depression through this project.

Moreover, the discouragement of pectin during fruit wine production has a negative impact on the environment that goes against the UN sustainable development goals. Therefore, we use the CRISPR-Cas9 technique to insert part of the pectinase gene into the yeast gene to form yeast with the function of decomposing pectin. By using this multi-functional yeast, the pectin in fruit will be decomposed during the fermentation of fruit wine.

https://teams.igem.org/4003	High School	Alzheimers Disease, Parkinsons Disease, etc. are called neurodegeneration diseases that have caused thousands of degenerated elders and even youngsters, and have become a major social issue. These neurodegeneration diseases are caused by excessive inflammation. Currently, there is no efficient method or medicine that can be applied to cure or effectively ease these diseases. Here, our project presents a novel target- PPM1A, which is a kind of protein phosphatase for medical usage that can prevent and ease inflammation response. The PPM1A activator can be used to repress the expression of certain genes through dephosphorylation in the microglia to prevent it from turning into M1 type. In our work, Compound 5 was demonstrated as a PPM1A activator and its anti-inflammatory effect was determined. We believe implementing Compound 5 into medical usage will provide a more efficient and effective way to prevent neurodegeneration diseases.

The condition is caused by a series of enteroviruses, including EV71, and VP1 is one of its pathogenic subunits. Since many of the infected children may be afraid of traditional injection-based vaccines, we are trying to develop an EV71 oral vaccine that will gain higher compliance among infant patients. Using E. coli and L. casei as the expressive system, we express the plasmids we constructed, pGEX-6P-1-VP1 and pGEX-6P-1-VP1-LTB.

https://teams.igem.org/4006	Environment	Arsenic contamination in groundwater is a serious problem both in local Arizonan communities and abroad: prolonged exposure to arsenic contamination can cause cancer, vascular damage, and liver failure. This project aims to engineer the microalgae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to sequester arsenic out of water. Metallothionein, arsenate reductase, and ferritin were integrated into the microalgae via the pASapI plasmid in varying permutations. The plasmid rescues function of the photosystem II gene, leveraging the ability to photosynthesize as a selective trait. Metallothionein and ferritin bind the two most common forms of arsenic: arsenite and arsenate, respectively. Arsenate reductase catalyzes the reduction of arsenate to arsenite, allowing for the ultimate sequestration of the toxic metal to occur in the chloroplast. Transformed algae were incubated with multiple concentrations of arsenic-contaminated media and the final concentration of arsenic after 2-3 days of exposure was measured using ICP-MS to quantify uptake efficacy.
https://teams.igem.org/4007	Environment	Reliable access to potable water is a major problem in Bolivia and other nations. Scarcity of this essential resource drives populations to seek drinking water from rivers, lakes, and wells. However, these sources can be dangerous if they are contaminated by heavy metals. Preliminary studies show that drinking water in Bolivian cities often contains highly hazardous levels of arsenic. In response, we designed and constructed a bacterial biosensor to rapidly quantify water sample arsenic content. The biosensor design strategy is called traffic light; it employs 4 genetic constructs to quantify defined ppb ranges of arsenic content in water. Light color responses indicate lower metal concentrations while increasingly dark color responses correspond to increased arsenic content. We created a portable device that houses the biosensor and allows one to quantify water samples anywhere. Our goal is to make the biosensor available to users in Bolivia and eventually around the world.
https://teams.igem.org/4008	Diagnostics	The COVID-19 pandemic has strained global diagnostic capacities and highlighted the limitations of conventional lab-based assays. Current on-site kits have false-negative rates as high as 33%. In an effort to provide accurate, non-invasive, affordable, and rapid Point of Care(POC) diagnostic tests for COVID-19 and other emerging pandemics, Purdue iGEM since the summer of 2020 has been working on cArgo: an Argonaute mediated microfluidic viral diagnostic device. cArgo extracts viral RNA from saliva for amplification and conversion into dsDNA. The TtAgo Argonaute protein then cleaves the dsDNA using viral strain-specific DNA guides producing ssDNA fragments. These fragments serve as secondary guides allowing the Argonaute to cleave the molecular beacon emitting a quantifiable fluorescent signal for conclusive result determination. Coupling the biologics with chip barcoding and app integration, we hope to revolutionize POC Diagnostics while making data more accessible for simultaneous detection and contact tracing.
https://teams.igem.org/4009	Food & Nutrition	The grapefruit-drug interaction refers to unpredictable adverse effects that occur when certain drugs are taken concurrently with grapefruit products. Grapefruits contain a family of compounds called furanocoumarins, which are known to repress CYP3A4, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of a large percentage of drugs prescribed today. This interaction causes increased bioavailability of some drugs and can result in unintentional drug overdose. Given the prevalence and popularity of grapefruit products and the number of affected drugs, our project is designed to provide passive negation of the grapefruit-drug interaction. Our plan is to put the gene for CYP6B1, an enzyme from the black swallowtail butterfly that breaks down furanocoumarins, into brewers yeast and colonize the human gut microbiome with our modified microbe to provide continuous mitigation and resilience to the drug interaction through the genes expression.
https://teams.igem.org/4010	Therapeutics	Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of immune-related diseases, characterized by chronic inflammation and severe tissue damages in the human gastrointestinal tract. Therapeutics developed using synthetic biology methods showed some efficacy in laboratory studies but failed to produce clinically relevant results. In this project, we performed a comprehensive literature review of recent advancements in the field and we proposed the use of bacteriocin to target the pathogenic bacteria adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC), which are closely involved in the development of IBD. We constructed a genetic circuit that can simultaneously detect the inflammation marker nitric oxide, and a pathogen-specific quorum sensing factor named autoinducer-3. Upon activation, the genetic circuit expresses colicin E1 and E9, two bacteriocins that can selectively eliminate the AIEC. We designed detailed experimental workflows for circuit construction through Gibson assembly and for functional verification. A mathematical model was also established to predict the outcomes of our design.

However, current industrial leather production causes environmental and ethical problems such as water pollution and animal cruelty. LINKS_China 2021 aims to create a sustainable and humane leather substitute using bacterial cellulose (BC) produced by co-culturing Komagataeibacter with Saccharomyces cerevisiae. By engineering S. cerevisiae, we induced transgenic expression of artificial spider-silk proteins fused with cellulose-binding matrixes, which increases the tensile strength and flexibility of BC membrane upon binding. Additionally, we enabled our engineered S. cerevisiae to synthesize ethyl acetate, giving our membrane a fruity fragrance. To endow our leather with more fashionable features, we used engineered Escherichia coli to synthesize different di-halogenated indigoid dyes for coloration. We expect our novel leather to be a transformative product that will continue the prosperity of fashion industry through a more humane and environmentally friendly technology.

Researches have proven that flavonoids could be potential in improving the seniors cognitive ability. We selected nine different genes from plants to build up two plasmids and used Saccharomyces cerevisiae as the chassis for expression. The first plasmid uses L-Tyrosine to produce naringenin, a central molecule in the production of flavonoids. The second plasmid converts naringenin into the final product -- catechin. As a crucial member of flavonoids, catechins plays a significant role in improving cognition and cardiovascular health. We hope that catechins could be used as food additive in elders daily diet, and therefore improve their memory. And we believe that it has the potential to become a new solution towards seniors health in the future.

First, we introduced the gene of yeast into Escherichia coli, and construct the IPA pathway. By taking Trp as the substrate, we verified that the genetic pathway is able to convert 80% of Trp into IAA within 48 hours. Afterwards, we built the expression vector of cyanobacteria and convert it into Cyanobacteria PCC6803. We hope to manufacture cyan sponge bricks that contain this microorganism to produce our product Auxwall, and promote the growth of plants in garden landscaping. We hope that this product will transform the agriculture and landscape design in the future.
https://teams.igem.org/4014	Environment	Heavy metal pollution is very serious in water. Our team came up with the idea of a "cruisable molecular magnet". "Molecular magnet" means it can capture heavy metal ions and store them in vacuoles. This can be achieved by expressing heavy metal binding proteins and autophagy-associated proteins in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. And "cruisable" means it can swim back and forth in sewage by our hardware device. This new device have an acrylic frame and cruise system, supplemented by sodium alginate embedding method and semipermeable membrane. On the one hand, it can cruise in the water by Beidou navigation satellite system (BDS) or remote control to capture heavy metal ions at different positions and facilitate recovery at the same time. On the other hand, it can prevent the leakage of genetically modified Chlamydomonas and provide a relatively stable and safe environment for Chlamydomonas.
https://teams.igem.org/4015	High School	In the enormous yet growing global rubber production, we see an urgent issue: waste rubber. By interviewing rubber recycling managers in China, we found that only 7% of 12945000 tons of rubber is recycled in 2020, meaning most rubber waste has either entered a landfill/open dump or an incinerator, both entail serious ecological/safety hazards. To combat this issue, we employed Latex Clearing Protein (LCP) as a means of rubber biodegradation. However, the implementation of LCP still faces many obstacles. To facilitate real-time rubber degradation, we introduced a signal peptide named hlyA that allows for the extracellular secretion of LCP, and for water solubility, we added a fusion protein named NusA. In addition, the signal peptide provides our project the potential for sustainable industrial-scale use. With improved efficiency, this project will become a promising and environmentally friendly rubber waste management method, hopefully contributing to the solution of this pressing global issue.

The more aging society grows, the more dental health problems become important. Our project aims to develop new probiotics that continuously prevent dental caries with engineered Lactococcus lactis. We designed Lactococcus lactis which is able to bind specifically to biofilm and diffuse growth inhibitors against bacteria causing dental caries. We also considered the practical use of recombinant probiotics in the real world and suggest how we can use engineered bacteria safely outside of the laboratory. We hope that our project contributes to the world without dental caries.
https://teams.igem.org/4020	Therapeutics	Around 2.3 billion people suffer from caries. The preventive measures include dietary restrictions, exposure to adequate doses of fluoride, and tooth brushing. However, inappropriate tooth brushing may cause dental cavities and harm gums. Therefore, safer and unified oral hygiene methods are in demand. Tooth decay is caused by bacteria that bind the human SALSA protein on teeth' surface, forming a biofilm and producing acids that destroy teeth. In SALSASMILE, we engineer a protease to target the SALSA protein. We expect that cleaving SALSA will remove bacteria even from the inaccessible areas, making oral hygiene more efficient. We develop a simple assay in yeast to select for proteases that cleave the desired sequence. Combined with deep mutational scanning or directed evolution, this is a powerful tool to engineer proteases. Everyone, especially children, people with orthodontic cases, or disabled individuals could use SALSASMILE alongside tooth brushing for improved oral hygiene.

The industry of mining, smelting, and refining heavy metals often leaves behind hazardous waste in the soil and air. Our project, RhizoMet, addresses these toxic levels of arsenic in soil through the use of bioremediation. As our proposed proof of concept, we plan to test the binding efficacy and specificity of our modified metallothionein proteins to arsenic. To accomplish this, metal tolerance and accumulation assays were performed on E.coli overexpressing these proteins. Given an effective model, we plan to incorporate these E.coli into the roots of Lomatium triternatum and other RhizoMet plants, remediating arsenic-polluted areas like those around metal smelteries. Through future iterations of our RhizoMet plant-E.coli system, we hope to expand the impact of this bioremediation method for areas like Northport and beyond.
https://teams.igem.org/4024	WIKI	While communities lacking access to safe and regulated water distribution need alternative water sources, a general rise in distrust and misinformation towards the microorganisms in municipal water has led many individuals to avoid safe tap water for the environmentally costly alternative of bottled water. In order to investigate this problem in our community, CHS_Missouri_US created a synthetic biology system that can examine tap and bottled water microbiomes. Utilizing shotgun metagenomic sequencing, we have built sequencing libraries targeting the V4 region of 16S rRNA genes extracted from the water samples. Unique molecular barcodes were attached to the samples to comprehensively identify the taxonomic profile and relative abundance of all genera within both samples. Research was then conducted to determine the pathogenic risk of the microbiota detected. The documentation for this process can be applied to characterize the microbiome of water sources globally and provide insight towards improved water contaminant testing.

Standard in-field detection methods such as MicPCR and MinION sequence internal transcribed spacer regions from swabs of epithelial cells to indicate the presence of fungal zoospores. However, these methods are expensive, time-consuming, and result in varying infection intensity across Bd strains. To address these concerns, we developed a microbial biosensor by engineering E. coli to express the chitin-activated V. cholerae one-component system coupled with a GFP reporter. Diverging from traditional detection methods that indicate zoospore presence, chitin in the cell walls of fungal zoosporangia will serve as the biomarker to indicate infection. This novel biosensor will provide field ecologists with an accessible alternative method to conduct preliminary site testing.

https://teams.igem.org/4028	Village	Protecting patent biotechnological strains is usually a costly and time-consuming process. Aiming to provide a fast, practical, and inexpensive way to protect patent rights over registered strains, our team constructed a genetic tool that disables the strains if theyre replicated without authorization. This mechanism is developed based on the Type IV Secretion System (T6SS) of Gram-negative bacteria which would inject effectors to inhibit the growth of recipient cells. However, these effectors are inactive in the donor due to the presence of immune protein. In our project, the plasmid that constitutively expresses Tke (effctor) was transformed into E. coli, and the immune factor Ike is induced by tetracycline.  After several tests, a suitable concentration of inducer that effectively disables the defense system was determined, which allowing the normal multiplication of the E. coli.

https://teams.igem.org/4030	Village	Dental caries, also known as tooth decay, have been one of the most usual diseases among people. It can directly disrupt oral health and even trigger the infection of other parts of the body. The main factor of Dental caries is the erosive organic acid created by bacteria on the surface of teeth metabolism. Chimeric Lysin ClyR is an enzyme originally produced by Bacteriophages that specifically attack bacteria that causes dental caries. Dr. Phage's mission is to create a kind of gene engineering E.coli strain that can enter the mouth and emit ClyR when induced of arabinoxylan. With this strain, people could avoid the further erosion from those oral harmful bacteria and achieve short-term protection, long-term prevention effect.
https://teams.igem.org/4031	Diagnostics	Japan has often been reported as a stress-filled society in recent years. However, many Japanese neglect the excessive stress that can cause depression and other problems. We assume this is due to the difficulty of quantitative measurement of stress and that patients cannot be diagnosed by appearance whether they are suffering or not. Human Herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) is a virus that infects 90% of humans in childhood and has the characteristic that it can remain latently in the human body for a lifetime. It has been reported that fatigue over a period of about a week reactivates the virus and is detected in saliva. Accordingly, we decided to create a system to quantify HHV-6 by using CRISPR based DETECTR assay (2018 Doudna et al.), based on our idea that the amount of the virus in saliva can be correlated with the stage of medium-term stress.
https://teams.igem.org/4032	Environment	Hot spring facilities all over the word have various problems caused by biofilms. For example, biofilms protect infectious microorganisms from disinfectants. Biofilms are communities of microorganisms that irreversibly stick to non-biological surfaces and grow on the surfaces, producing exopolysaccharides that facilitate attachment and matrix formation. To break down such biofilms, we constructed a vector for expression of a glycolytic enzyme fused to RFP (red) that degrades exopolysaccharides. An Escherichia coli strain was used not only as an expression host but also as a carrier of the enzyme to biofilms. The strain also contained a suicide vector as the second vector that can cause bacteriolysis under some specific condition. Our findings showed that experimental biofilms were efficiently degraded by the glycolytic enzyme that leaked from the lysed transformant cells . The use of the red transformant may make it easier to kill infectious microorganisms with disinfectants or remove biofilms from bathtubs.

https://teams.igem.org/4034	New Application	Nucleic acid amplification (NAA) techniques, such as Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), are a standard biological laboratory technique, also used for diagnostics. The aim of this project is to make NAA techniques more accessible. Two of the key components of PCR are a polymerase and the four deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs). However, the total cost of dNTPs production is significant and they are often produced by complicated, unsustainable chemical processes, mainly feasible in centralized laboratories with expensive equipment. For this project, a high yield genetic circuit is designed in order to produce ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) and thymidylate synthase (TSase), two enzymes necessary for the production of dNTPs. The produced dNTPs, along with thermostable Pfu DNA Polymerase, also included in the designed genetic circuit, allow for a low-cost PCR, with components not requiring cold storage. This procedure allows for an alternative approach for the production of basic PCR reagents.
https://teams.igem.org/4035	Environment	Mildew is a destructive fungal disease of plants including wine-producing grapevines. For more than a century, mildew has been treated with bio farming compatible copper-based fungicides which adhere to plant leaves. However, though only trace amounts of copper is present in wine made from treated plants, when rain washes the fungicide away, toxic levels of copper contaminate the surrounding soil, inhibiting new cultivation and biodiversity. Our goal is to remove copper from grapevine rainwater runoff to prevent this pollution. We generated yeast strains which express the normally intracellular copper-binding protein CUP1 in multiple copies and configurations on their surface to enable bioadsorption of environmental copper. As a proof-of-concept for a real-world implementation of our decontamination strategy, we have designed and built a prototype bioreactor to enable the removal of copper from rainwater by our modified yeast. We envision our solution could help protect wine growing regions from copper soil pollution.
https://teams.igem.org/4036	Foundational Advance	Optogenetic tools allow for unprecedented dynamic control, immediacy, and reversibility of metabolic processes. However, there lacks methods to stimulate and monitor optogenetically-responsive samples simultaneously in a high-throughput manner. We developed the OptoReader to address this gap. The OptoReader is an affordable, open-source device that couples optogenetic stimulation with real-time fluorescence and optical density measurements, allowing for 96 programmable parallel experiments. It consists of two circuit boards. The stimulation assembly is a modified optoPlate-96. The reader assembly is an array of photodiodes and UV LEDs compatible with a standard 96-well plate. Arduino microcontrollers control both circuit boards to communicate with a general computer and each other. We demonstrate OptoReader measurement of OD and fluorescence in bacterial cultures and show how OD readings can be used for feedback controlled optogenetic stimulation parameters. We expect that the OptoReader will enable entirely new optogenetic experiments with impact in both basic and applied sciences.
https://teams.igem.org/4037	Therapeutics	Encapsulins (Encs) are a class of proteins that self-assemble and envelope other functional cargo proteins when co-expressed. Encs are relatively simple protein shells, yet they are stable and can carry robust cargo. We believe this represents an opportunity for novel drug delivery. In this work, we investigate the intake of assembled Encs by living eukaryotic cells and whether the Enc containers can be disassembled by protein-degradation enzymes native to the targeted organism. Brewers yeast (S. cerevisiae) was selected as the proof-of-concept organism for this project, and mNeon green was chosen as the model Enc cargo. We are cloning bacteria that will produce Enc shells with yeast mating pheromone tags displayed on their surfaces. The tags will encourage the yeast to endocytose the disguised Encs into the cell from the environment. Success will be measured by using fluorescence imaging to confirm the presence of assembled mNeon green-bearing shells within live cells.

Research done over the past year revealed the impact of COVID-19 on healthcare staff and services, as well as the need for expanded home testing options for common illnesses. As a response to this need, our device creates a simple method to detect influenza A with a saliva sample that can be easily distributed to aid local and global public health efforts by increasing access to care.
https://teams.igem.org/4040	Therapeutics	Elimination of the SARS-COV-2 and balance the immune response are both important for late-stage COVID-19, however, no ideal therapeutics can achieve the two goals for our knowledge. To address this, we have 1) designed synthetic antiviral macrophages with immune-regulatory capacity and 2) demonstrated its feasibility through both in vitro experiments and mathematical modeling. The designed synthetic antiviral macrophages, termed "Toggle Macrophages", have the phagocytic capacity specific for SARS-COV-2 and showed pro-inflammatory/anti-inflammatory phenotypic transformation according to the level of local IL-6 concentration. Therefore, as "smart" therapeutics, Toggle Macrophages can both reduce the viral load through phagocytosis and balance the immune system via phenotypic transformation. We further mathematically modeled and analyzed the feasibility of the practical application of Toggle Macrophages in humans. This work supports the use of Toggle Macrophages as a novel Genetically Engineered Cellular Platform that may be useful in future therapeutic approaches against severe COVID-19.

https://teams.igem.org/4043	Village	Plastic waste pollution has seriously threatened the environment and creatures. Here, we designed a burying yard with concentrated PET plastics, using the modified Bacillus subtilis carried by earthworms to initially degrade PET ,accelerating the degradation of PET plastics in it. At the same time, the activities of earthworms are used to improve the distribution of engineering bacteria and enzymes,solving the difficulty of frequent mixing in the dump site. The modified engineering bacteria release PETase and MHETase to hydrolyze PET into ethylene glycol and terephthalic acid,finally metabolizing it into carbon dioxide and water. Whats more ,we also inserted GFP gene into the plasmid to further track the distribution of engineering bacteria in the soil. And by detecting the fluorescence in the body or feces of the earthworms, we can know  whether the engineered bacteria have been swallowed by the earthworms. The expected result is that the engineered bacteria can be carried elsewhere through the activities of earthworms, which will promote the distribution of engineered bacteria in the soil.
https://teams.igem.org/4044	Food & Nutrition	The question of food supply for the long-distance flights remains still unsolved. Moreover, onboard food production must meet restricted requirements due to the curtailed resources on the spacecraft. &#1057;yanobacteria Arthrospira platens is a perfect candidate in this case. However, it is tasteless. A long-term ASCEND project is aimed to introduce Arthrospira platensis engineered to produce any genes of interest, and flavours in particular, as a new chassis for the synthetic biology community. We have designed and tested a special optogenetic system, which will facilitate switching between different products and help optimize growth and production conditions. Blue light induces anchoring of BcLOV4 protein in the plasma membrane and maintains culture growth, whereas far-red light induces the production of genes of interests by activating the BphP1 light-sensitive protein and forcing it to inactivate QPAS1-Gal4 repressor. This year genetic constructions were trialed in E.coli with YFP as a test gene.
https://teams.igem.org/4045	Foundational Advance	Multiplexing of the CRISPR/Cas system increases gene-editing efficiency and expands CRISPR/Cas function to multiple locations at once. However, multiplexing involves using repetitive sequences in the crRNA arrays, which can be unstable on plasmids and susceptible to recombination. We are designing new sequences of the crRNA scaffolding region of the CRISPR/Francisella novicida Cas12a system to expand the crRNA sequences available for multiplexing. We performed site-directed mutagenesis by PCR on our crRNA scaffold sequences, created linear DNA amplicons comprising multiple mutations each, and ligated the ends to make a circular plasmid. We transformed the recombinant plasmid libraries, which included a nuclease dead Cas12a (dCas21a) into E. coli with functional plasmids inhibiting the promoter sequence of pGEX-iLOV (called CRISPR interference, or CRISPRi). Using fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS), we sorted out the functional plasmids. We will analyze next generation sequencing data to identify and characterize the successful sequences.
https://teams.igem.org/4046	New Application	Clinical treatment of glioblastoma, a disease that kills over 10,000 Americans annually, is limited by the lack of a scalable, physiologically-relevant model for testing therapeutics. Duke iGEM is developing NODES, a high-throughput organoid-based drug screening platform to characterize treatment efficacy in common glioma variants. We designed a non-invasive reporter device that quantifies the drug response of mutation-specific glioma cells in a mini-brain co-culture model, grown in a droplet-based system. Additionally, we modeled our reporter system, which detects oncometabolite levels throughout brain tumor development, to improve device characteristics and developed a machine-learning based image analysis pipeline for organoid screening. To identify the social and ethical implications of our work, we interviewed patients, clinicians, and other stakeholders and integrated their feedback into our design. By recapitulating the brain microenvironment, NODES has the potential to accurately characterize drug responses, offering new hope to patients in their fight against this lethal disease.
https://teams.igem.org/4047	Food & Nutrition	Global agricultural productivity is projected to not meet the needs of increasing populations developing higher standards of living. On a cellular level, crop yield is limited by the inefficiency of photosynthesis. Our project aims to improve this efficiency by implementing an alternative RuBP regeneration portion of the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle. Two alternative pathways, which use enzymes from other reactions that act on common metabolites used in the CBB cycle, were explored first via computational modeling. Impacts on growth and reaction fluxes in silico assessed the validity of these pathways in creating a more robust photosynthetic cycle. One of these pathways which overexpresses the native enzyme transaldolase, was also assessed in vivo. Ultimately, we showed the validity of two alternative pathways in allowing a more efficient regeneration stage of the CBB Cycle. These pathways could eventually be implemented into higher plants to allow more robust cycling and therefore higher crop yield.

Microbial communities cover the human body and form a biological suit that helps humans to perform various vital functions. The project aims to populate humans natural suit with gene-modified bacteria synthesizing radioprotective proteins. New microbiota will pave a way for further space exploration plans including human settlements on the Moon or an expedition to Mars. We will modify Human bacteria using silicon nanoparticles with absorbed genetic material. Inserted genes will motivate bacteria for secreting radioprotectors packed in Outer Membrane Vesicles (OMVs) capable of fusing with human cells. The bacterial communities developed within this project will be the first synthetic human microbiota engineered to perform specific functions in its natural epitopes.
https://teams.igem.org/4051	Environment	Mars holds great interest to humanity and commercial applications alike due to its suitability for potential habitation. One issue withstanding are the components of the planets soil that contains toxic levels of sodium perchlorate making growth of food impossible. Our team has devised a solution by engineering E.coli with genomic islands from A. suilum which breakdown the sodium perchlorate in the soil through the enzymes Perchlorate reductase and Chlorite dismutase. The bacteria is housed within a 3D printed, novel, spherical design allowing biofilm formation, bacterial proliferation, enzyme distribution and addition of a seed for bioremediating and cultivating the Martian soil. This design has been titled the Biofrag 2.0. The Biofrag can be used within specially contained Biofrag Isolation Units which allow for contained remediation of soil whilst preventing widespread contamination. Each box also allows for optimal conditions for growth of both flora and microbiome within the Biofrag.
https://teams.igem.org/4052	High School	The purpose of our project is to address the issue of effectively revealing signs of feline diabetes, as current solutions are often limited and time-consuming. Our primary goal was to produce a biosensor that creates a purple pigment in the presence of elevated levels of glucose which will act as an indication of feline diabetes. A reaction will occur between the glucose in a cat's urine and oxygen, catalyzed by glucose oxidase. This will produce hydrogen peroxide, which will react with a colorimetric assay to produce a color change. Through synthetic biology principles, we aim to apply our biosensor to provide cat owners with an early detection method for feline diabetes and other conditions.
https://teams.igem.org/4053	Diagnostics	As we have learnt from interviews, assays that can detect mutations accurately are valuable in the diagnosis of fast evolving infectious diseases and cancer. Furthermore, in pandemics such as COVID-19, rapid point-of-care detection is essential to isolate patients as fast as possible and minimize spreading of the disease. Hence, we have developed a sensitive and easy-to-use diagnostic kit that can accommodate direct patient samples without RNA extraction and deliver results in under 40 minutes. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) was utilised to amplify the target genes. After amplification, a novel CRISPR-Cas12a Lb-RVRR enzyme was employed to identify different mutations based on the fluorescence intensity. Alternatively, we developed a probe that was sensitive to point mutations, allowing us to distinguish between different genetic variants in COVID-19 and cancer. Thus, our project has provided with better methods to diagnose such diseases for a better future.
https://teams.igem.org/4054	Diagnostics	In summary, our project aims to quantitatively detect the bacterial pathogens in food by using the edited assembly-deficient phage to target and lyse the bacteria, and then release the exogenous protein LuxR; the released LuxR can then activate downstream cell-free gene circuit and generate visual signals. The CRISPR-Cas9 system is applied to disrupt gp24 gene, an essential gene for T4 phage assembly, with LuxR gene to produce LuxR as signalling molecules for downstream system activation and prevent phage assembly at the same time. The assembly-deficient phage cannot therefore replicate in the host cells more than one generation. The downstream circuit outputs binary signals indicating whether the concentration of bacteria exceeds the national standard or not: if the concentration of the target bacteria is higher than the standard, the system will output a visual signal, otherwise, the signal will not be displayed.

Our project is to operate the modified E.coli which can be induced by blue light to produce a layer combined calcium carbonate, pigment and adhesive directly at the damaged position of the fresco. After the combination of these three, a micron level colored calcium layer will be formed on the wall surface, so as to repair the damaged frescos.
https://teams.igem.org/4056	Environment	The increasing amount of antibiotics in the environment has led to a rising number of antibiotic resistant bacteria, putting human and animal health at risk. Antibiotic use in poultry farming remains high and leads to antibiotic pollution. The problem of AMR is now a serious threat to the achievement of many of the Sustainable Development Goals as indicated by the United Nations. Defending the One Health approach, we aim to design a bacterial mechanism, which can inactivate tetracyclines and macrolides in the surrounding environment, while containing a self-destruction mechanism, activated when it has fulfilled its role. For this purpose, we partnered with iGEM IISER-Tirupati, to share their kill switch based on the action of a modified bpDNase1. The bacterial cell death is regulated by the presence of antibiotics using TetR and MphR as antibiotic sensors. Our idea could be applied in chicken manure making the final product safe and antibiotic-free.

We have worked with professionals in the industry and experts in the fields of agriculture and genetic engineering in order to better understand how our research can be applied. We have also partnered with other iGEM teams to create a series of academic materials covering different facets of synthetic biology. We have partnered with teachers in order to gain feedback on this work, and to determine how this material could be effectively deployed in a classroom setting.
https://teams.igem.org/4059	Manufacturing	We want to contribute to the utilization of psilocybins absolute potential by reducing the costs of acquiring the substance for research projects. Psilocybin is currently undergoing clinical trials, to explore its potential as a treatment method for depression. However, it has shown itself to be a very difficult and expensive process to chemically synthesize psilocybin or purify it from the mushrooms. Despite recent improvements in heterologous production of psilocybin using either bacteria or yeast, current methods persist to be tedious and costly with a reduced yield. That is why we aim to construct an enhanced biosynthesis of psilocybin from tryptophan, by introducing all four different enzymes from the Funghi in Escherichia coli. After successfully producing psilocybin in E. coli, we hope to transfer this system to our ideal, non-pathogenic host organism, Rhodovulum sulfidophilum that only needs sunlight and seawater to grow, thereby making a sustainable and safe cell factory.
https://teams.igem.org/4060	Therapeutics	A fatal cardiovascular disease, Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) is a rising major health problem due to the potentially lethal complications such as pulmonary embolism. Since an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, our project Natto It Out aims to prevent DVT progression at its earliest onset via a fibrinolytic proteaseNattokinase. In this project, we engineered an E. coli, which is designed to be able to release the NK in the intestine, by inserting the Nattokinase DNA sequence from B. subtilis into pET21a plasmids. In addition, we integrated the BphP1-QPAS1 optogenetic system to manipulate Nattokinase production remotely, along with a detector that could instantly calculate the risks of DVT. To overcome biosafety concerns, we adapted the mazEF toxin-antitoxin system into our kill switch design to mediate cell death once they have been released into the environment.
https://teams.igem.org/4061	Food & Nutrition	Paralytic shellfish toxins (PST), such as Saxitoxin and Tetrodotoxin, are neurotoxins found in shellfish like clams, mussels, and oysters, that cause Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning (PSP) by blocking the sodium channels in neurons. Current methods to test for PSTs suffer from massive drawbacks in terms of ethics, complexity, accessibility, and cost. Hence, we are building a prokaryotic biosensor for the detection of a wide range of PSTs that is ethical, cheap, simple, and direct. The biosensor utilises the antagonistic interaction between Shellfish Toxins and Veratridine to induce significant ionic changes within the cell. An engineered Two Component System in the cells senses this change in intracellular ionic levels and modulates gene expression leading to expression of different reporter proteins. Red fluorescent colour is expected when the toxin is present while green when it is not. Small-scale testing laboratories and even shellfish farms could employ our kit for quality assurance of shellfish.
https://teams.igem.org/4062	New Application	iGEM teams use synthetic biology to solve thousands of problems around the world. From diagnostic tests for cancer to biosensors that detect water contamination, using bacteria and their environment to influence gene expression is commonplace in synthetic biology. However, there are few resources available to those wanting to learn the foundation of all synthetic biology: gene regulation. Especially in urban settings like Milwaukee, a reliable gene regulation curriculum is absent. Furthermore, the concepts integral to understanding gene regulation are intricate, complex, and incredibly difficult to communicate. A reliable, hands-on educational kit simplifies the learning process tremendously. Using the well-documented and understood regulatory components of the lac operon, WLC-Milwaukee created BlacOps, a laboratory kit that effectively teaches the principles of gene regulation.
https://teams.igem.org/4063	Village	Bacteriophages exist in both natural and artificial environments and are able to transfer DNA from one type of bacteria to another. Bacteria, such as E.coli, released from synthetic biology labs may be infected by certain bacteriophages and the antibiotic resistance transferred to other bacteria leading to biosafety issues. To better understand this problem, we will assess the potential risk of lateral transfer of E. coli plasmids by T4 bacteriophages under different conditions. We have shown that T4 can transfer plasmid DNA, which does increase the risk of lateral transfer. However, the number of E. coli phages present in our local environment appears to be quite low, reducing the risk. We added four new T4 early promoters to the registry to support our project. Additionally, our team focuses on providing students who have visual and motor challenges a way to measure liquids through 3-D printing.

To achieve this, we have continued our work on Synbiofoam, a firefighting foam composed of foaming and stabilizing agents like Ranaspumins (a series of proteins from a native frog) and surfactin and biofilm, both naturally produced by B. subtilis, and whose production will be regulated through a circuit intended to control the bacteriums own regulatory network. As we continue to validate and modify our project based on our stakeholders responses, we believe that our project will positively impact our society and environment.

In order to find the source of the disease, improve to the research community and strive for more personalized health care, we at iGEM Stockholm developed a semi-quantitative rapid test to detect potential dysbiosis that causes the skin diseases. This has been done by developing aptamers targeting teichoic acid that exists in all gram-positive bacteria, which constitutes nearly all bacteria of the skin microbiome. Moreover, other aptamers target C.acnes and S.aureus, which are known to cause skin problems.

Crops can be especially susceptible to fungus that infect the root system, like Rhizoctonia solani. Although R. solani threatens many major crops, there are no direct treatments against the pathogen, only management strategies. This project aims to genetically engineer Escherichia coli to produce antifungal compounds which alone, or together in synergy, are effective in inhibiting the growth of R. solani. To accomplish this goal, golden gate cloning was utilized to create several E. coli strains with different antifungal genes. These modified strains were then placed in an antifungal assay with R. solani to establish inhibitory and co-inhibitory effects. Future research would explore inserting these genes in bacteria that have symbiotic relationships with crops to protect against R. solani.

This project focuses on the HKT1 pathway and overexpresses the pathway in plants battling higher concentrations of salt, to adapt and over time and breed new generations of more-tolerant plants. HKT1-type transporters are key determinants of Na+ and K+ homeostasis under salt stress and they contribute to reducing Na+-specific toxicity in plants. We created four new parts using knowledge from previous literature in which the chassis, E. coli will act as a device to insert a sequence to overexpress the HKT1 gene in plants. The CrGPDH3 promoter gene from C. reinhardtii was found to be inducible under NaCl treatments from previous laboratory experiments, therefore, the project focused on combining the RIA1 section of the CrGPDH3 promoter to initiate overexpression for the HKT1 transporter.
https://teams.igem.org/4074	Therapeutics	Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is a rare metabolic disorder characterized by the inability to break down branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs). Untreated, accumulation of toxic byproducts results in irreversible neurological impairment and death. Besides liver transplantation, there is no curative treatment. Those unable to undergo such treatment must strictly control dietary protein intake to prevent metabolic decompensation. However, the gut represents a promising non-invasive intervention point, demonstrated by the amino acid enterorecirculation model. After consulting industry professionals engineering a probiotic treatment for phenylketonuria, a similar metabolic disorder, academic and medical experts, and stakeholders affected by MSUD, we designed a B. subtilis probiotic strain to more efficiently catabolize BCAAs in the gastrointestinal tract. Our approach focuses on overexpressing genes for BCAA importers and catabolic enzymes via a regulatory recombinase switch; and developing an ODE model of probiotic BCAA metabolism based on B. subtilis growth, gene expression, enzyme kinetics, and recombinase activity.

The Auviola project utilized an engineered Chromobacterium violaceum. To optimize and design the system, kinetic and genomic scale models were demonstrated in both the extraction process and the cyanide degradation afterward. The bioreactor was also designed as the pilot scale for implementing the engineered gold bioleaching process. In the future, this project has the potential to be implemented as a sustainable low-cost gold bioleaching system for the artisanal and small-scale gold miners to bring achievable and beneficial impacts. Moreover, we also contribute to educating the students for understanding and implementing synthetic biology.

Despite its nutritious and functional food qualities, the consumption of cotton seeds is severely hampered by the presence of a toxic terpenoid known as gossypol. The enzymatic method has proved to be effective for detoxifying gossypol as it is substrate-specific. To date, the degossypolyzation of CSM by enzymatic techniques remains largely unexplored. In the present study, we have computationally screened for enzymes displaying affinity towards gossypol. The top screened enzymes were cloned and expressed in Pichia pastoris and further provided with crude glycerol as a carbon source for cost-effectiveness. Subsequently, the expressed enzymes were verified for their in vitro degossypolyzation ability against CSM. Moreover, the process parameters of enzymatic degradation will be statistically optimized for the maximal reduction in gossypol content of CSM.
https://teams.igem.org/4078	Manufacturing	There is a growing demand to reduce production of chemicals via traditional manufacturing. Industries that would benefit from biomanufacturing of compounds via microorganisms include pharmaceuticals, cosmetics/fragrances, and other commercial industries. One molecule with potential applications in these fields is the monoterpenoid &#945;-terpineol. &#945;-Terpineol has been shown to have many medicinal and insecticidal properties. Here, we focused on biomanufacturing &#945;-terpineol as a potential mosquito repellant. Specifically, we aimed to produce &#945;-terpineol via de novo synthesis in Escherichia coli cells utilizing an inducible dual plasmid system. The engineered strain was produced by transforming one plasmid which contained the upstream enzymes of the mevalonate (MEV) pathway and a second plasmid which was constructed to contain the enzymes geranyl pyrophosphate synthase (GPPS) and &#945;-terpineol synthase (&#945;TS). These enzymes convert the end products of the MEV pathway to &#945;-terpineol. Preliminary results show that the system requires further optimization and troubleshooting to result in &#945;-terpineol production.
https://teams.igem.org/4079	WIKI	In Parkinsons disease (PD) patients, misfolded alpha-synuclein (aSyn) forms protein inclusions (Lewy bodies) inside neurons, causing neuronal degeneration and symptoms of the disease. Previous studies have shown that increasing the number of chaperon proteins inside the cells or boosting the levels of autophagy, reduces the amounts of misfolded aSyn inclusions. The goal of this project is to target these two processes specifically to the misfolded aSyn instead of indirectly tinkering with cell metabolism. Specifically, the chaperon HSP70 is fused to wild-type aSyn (WT-aSyn). This fusion protein will interact directly with misfolded aSyn converting it into the functional conformation. In the second design, a hydrophobic domain and the LC3-interacting region of SQSTM1 are fused to the WT-aSyn. This fusion protein will drive autophagic membranes to incorporate and degrade misfolded aSyn. Lewy bodies are simulated and monitored using a PD-associated aSyn mutant tagged with the green fluorescent protein.
https://teams.igem.org/4080	Foundational Advance	Indonesia is struggling to independently meet industrial enzyme demands despite efforts to develop cheaper technologies to produce them. Although various enzyme overexpression systems are available, the cost of purification remains a major obstacle. To help address this, we propose the Clean Harvest of Overexpressed Protein (CHOP) system. The system works by anchoring an enzyme of interest (EoI) onto the extracellular terminals of an outer membrane protein (OMP). As the cells grow, they will naturally shed their outer membrane as vesicles (OMV) containing OMP-EoI fusion. Due to OMVs being smaller than cells yet larger than free proteins, they can be separated from the bulk of protein impurities, simplifying the downstream processing. Once separated, the EoI may be released from the OMP by cleaving off a specific linker between the fusion with specific proteases. The development of overexpression systems that simplify downstream purification is expected to significantly reduce enzyme production costs.
https://teams.igem.org/4081	High School	2&#8242;-Fucosyllactose (2-FL), one of the most abundant oligosaccharides in human milk, has potential applications in foods due to its infant health benefits. Due to it is prohibitively expensive to obtain 2-FL directly from human milk, alternative microbial production of 2-FL is considered promising. Microbial production of 2-FL has been studied mostly in Escherichia coli. To avoid endotoxin contamination and bacteriophage infection in the fermentation process to produce 2-FL using E. coli, Jianhua aims to produce 2-FL by engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae which is generally recognized as safe and has been widely used in food industries. First, using FKP to produce intracellular GDP-l-fucose. Second, Lac12 transports lactose, a fucose acceptor in 2-FL production into cytosol of S. cerevisiae cells. Finally, FucT2, which catalyzes fucosylation of lactose into 2-FL using GDP-l-fucose needs to be introduced.
https://teams.igem.org/4082	Diagnostics	Chytridiomycosis is a fungal disease that has devastated amphibian populations, leading to substantial losses in biodiversity. Caused by the infection of the fungi Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) or Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Bsal), chytridiomycosis causes rapid decline and extinction of amphibian populations. Both species are responsible for fatal disease; however, Bd infects frogs and toads, while Bsal generally affects salamanders. Amphibians rarely display visible symptoms, limiting diagnosis of chytridiomycosis to post-mortem examination, which highlights the need for diagnostic devices. Current methods for identification of the pathogen are laboratory equipment-dependent, time-consuming, and expensive which contributes to the spread of infection. Thus, our team is developing a diagnostic device that allows for rapid detection of the two disease-causing fungi in a field setting. To bypass the time consuming DNA amplification step, we use electrokinetic concentration of the extracted DNA, followed by a CRISPR-Cas 12a complex binding to the Bd or Bsal target DNA for detection.
https://teams.igem.org/4083	Environment	Increasing demand for oil & gas production in modern days pushes for higher production and distribution rates. The occurrence of oil spills in such processes is not unusual and the vast majority are left unaccounted for. Existing treatment methods are only efficient for localized spills shortly after the accident, while in the long-term they are less cost-effective and hazardous to Kazakhstani endemic flora & fauna. We propose a solution to this problem by developing a novel agent for crude oil bioremediation - Remi, du et!. Specifically, we modify nonvirulent Pseudomonas putida using a dual-inducible system for overexpression of genes nadE and rhlA/B, coding for NAD synthetase and rhamnolipids, respectively. The metabolically-engineered bacteria demonstrate a high yield of rhamnolipids when grown as biofilms under electrofermentative conditions. Since produced rhamnolipids are biosurfactants that emulsify crude oil, the resulting product can be used directly for the treatment of oil spills in ecologically-sensitive areas.

https://teams.igem.org/4085	WIKI	2&#8242; -fucosyllactose (2&#8242; -FL), one of the simplest but most abundant oligosaccharides in human milk, has many benefits for the healthy development of newborns. However, the high-cost production and limited availability restrict its widespread use in infant nutrition and further research on its potential functions. This year, Ulink-SIP aims at producing 2-FL by engineered Escherichia coli. First, we co-expressed the genes for GDP-L-fucose biosynthesis and heterologous &#945;-1,2-fucosyltransferase in E.coli. Then, we deletion genes (wcaJ, nudD, and nudK) involved in the degradation of the precursors GDP-L-fucose and GDP-mannose to further boost the carbon flux from GDP-L-fucose toward 2&#8242;-FL synthesis. Finally, preliminary optimization of fermentation conditions was used to achieve a high yield. As a proof of concept, our preliminary 2-FL production demonstrated a superior production performance.
https://teams.igem.org/4086	WIKI	The goal of our project is to provide a novel drug delivery system by combining the principles of living therapeutics and N2B delivery. We demonstrate this concept on LEAP2, an endogenous antagonist of the ghrelin receptor GHS-R1a, found in the hypothalamus. The results of an existing mural model suggest that LEAP2 may be used to treat Class I and II obesity in humans. To achieve this, LEAP2 must be periodically supplied directly to the brain. For nasally administered proteins, such delivery is possible via the olfactory and trigeminal nerves, thus bypassing the BBB. We created DH5 alpha and BL21 strains of E.coli that secrete a fusion protein composed of LEAP2, LMWP (a CPP) and a Myc-tag. We're also investigating how CPP's affect membrane permeability to proteins from the "inside". We plan to test our system using an in vitro ALI Transwell system with an artificial mucosal layer.

https://teams.igem.org/4088	Diagnostics	Equine herpesvirus outbreaks lead to mass deaths and quarantines. Disease symptoms can be easily confused with other diseases. Current diagnosis methods - PCR-tests - are time-consuming. Therefore, we decided to create a test system based on CRISPR-Cas. It detects herpesvirus by its RNA. We use deadCas13 protein, connected by a linker with two halves of reporter protein - beta-lactamase. Two deadCas13 proteins are directed by gRNA to the RNA of the virus. When the distance between two Cas-proteins is correctly selected, two beta-lactamase proteins can fuse into a functional protein that destroys nitrocefin  the solution's color changes from yellow to red. To avoid false-positive results, we use two guide RNAs. With one guide, RNA reporter protein will not become functional. We are willing to create a system that will not require any special skills to use it. Horse owners will be able to detect herpesvirus using only saliva.
https://teams.igem.org/4089	Asia	Nucleic acid amplification tests like polymerase chain reaction have high sensitivity and are the standard test for the diagnosis of infections like Covid19. However, they require molecular biology laboratories and trained personnel. Therefore, they are not point of care (POC) diagnostics. Rapid antigen tests fix an antibody to a chromatic paper strip, detecting antigens binding to this antibody. However, since there is no amplification, sensitivity is low. Combining the principles of these methods, our kit works by binding a molecule of the infectious agent on a strip via antibody or DNA probe, then doing signal amplification on the bound molecule. This involves an innovative isothermal nucleic acid amplification at room temperature, not requiring sophisticated instruments. The nucleic acid amplification depends on a synthetic original enzyme that can cut one strand enabling strand displacement by DNA polymerase. This method may enable rapid diagnosis of diseases at POC and help control pandemics.

Our inhibitor aims to act against phospholipase A2, one of the main groups of enzymes present in the venom, responsible mainly for the necrosis that also has a synergyc effect with the other enzymes. The expectatives with our project is to provide to our community a faster and more accessible treatment, hence, reducing the sequels and death rate due to Bothrops ophidic accidents.

In our country, nearly 558 municipalities are dedicated to its production, and its use for the manufacture of tequila generates a net income of more than 1 billion USD every year, but its production faces an obstacle: the wilting of agave, which is caused by a diversity of fungi and leads to the eventual death of the plant. Current detection systems are either visual or laboratory examinations, but the process can take up to three weeks, and by that time the infection can be spread through the whole land. Our proposal, Diagnosgene, consists of a rapid, easy-to-use, early detection system which can be implemented on the field. The detection which occurs within a cell-free system, is accomplished by the usage of toehold switches, which are RNA tools that get specifically attached to a given complementary sequence.

In this project, we introduced a probiotic which was previously genetically edited by us to possess the ability to secret Xylanase and form a feed that can be applied in monogastrics, mainly poultrys daily meals. The product will be designed as a type of beverage to make up for the poultrys insufficiency of the xylan digestive enzymes In this case, poultry will be able to absorb more energy when given the same amount of feed, which will further ease the food resource shortage in the world.
https://teams.igem.org/4094	WIKI	Team UC Davis seeks to optimize mRNA delivery in vitro for the foundational advancement of mRNA vaccine technology, namely to reduce side effects caused by an innate immune response due to sudden influx of spike protein. We plan to insert an RNA secondary structure known as an Iron Response element (IRE) into the 5 UTR that reduces the sudden influx of spike protein by gradually releasing the available mRNA transcripts for translation. The protein known as an iron response binding protein (IRBP1/IRBP2) binds and blocks translation until an iron allosterically binds and IRBP/1IRBP2 unbinds to allow for translation. A working pipeline was created to automate the insertion process and structural stability by utilizing the RNA folding package, Vienna. To prove the mRNA/IREBP system constructs were expressed transiently in mammalian cell cultures and translation was monitored with destabilized YFP. The design is modular and able to integrate into any mRNA therapy.

Even though we encountered many difficulties in lab work, we finally obtained our engineered E. coli which could express the desired cellulase. We hope this silage additive could contribute the stockbreeding development and improve life quality in the future.

Recent studies show that L. casei's capabilities in medicine and food are highly restricted by their low transformation efficiency of foreign DNA, due to its restriction-modification system. Our purpose is to improve the transformation efficiency of foreign DNA in L. casei to maximize their benefits. In the laboratory, we constructed a plasmid containing CRISPR-Cas9 in E.coli, then transformed the plasmid into L.casei so that the target gene LSEI-2094 can be removed and the restriction-modification system can be silenced. Lastly, we confirmed the results through both sequencing and controlled experiments to verify the efficiency before and after the modification. Results show that the transformation efficiency has significantly increased post-modification, it is hopeful that this modified L. casei could be applicable in pharmaceutical and food.

REEs are essential in all fields of modern technology  from automobility to medical diagnostics. The current REE mining is energy-intense and relies on many synthesized chemicals. We developed a protein-based process to increase sustainability and selectivity of REE mining. The bacterial protein lanmodulin (LanM) was heterologously produced in E. coli and purified in a novel, chromatography-free one-step method. LanM was added to an ore leachate to form an REE-LanM complex. After isolation of this complex, REE ions were released by pH reduction. Upon removal of LanM, this biological chelator was regenerated and a highly pure REE solution was obtained. Our project is characterized by iterative process optimization tailoring the approach to industrial application. Overall, it was demonstrated that the protein LanM can replace current chemical chelating agents in REE mining.

We used PAGE and denaturing PAGE to validate the specific cleavage activity. We also confirmed that Cu2+ is significant in catalyzation, and that it is an efficient system in detecting the target gene. Lastly, gold nanoparticles functionalized with the complementary target DNA sequences to the cleaved DNA products were employed as a colorimetric approach to visualize the DNAzyme catalyzed cleavage reaction.

We will create an engineered bacterium that uses wastewater as a growth medium to produce and release auxin, an algal growth factor. When deployed in a co-culture system, the presence of these bacteria will allow microalgae to grow more efficiently on wastewater. Once sufficient algal biomass has been produced, the engineered bacteria can be triggered to move from an auxin-producing state to a phosphate-accumulating state, using a light-dependent genetic switch mechanism. This will lead to phosphate depletion in the medium and a transition of the microalgae from their active growth phase to a state of lipid accumulation (improved by phosphate starvation). Increased lipid accumulation can then be used to produce biodiesel. Our project could be the first step towards economically sustainable microalgal biofuel production to meet global energy demands.

However, the toxic compound furfural, commonly found in lignocellulosic waste, is greatly hampering the growth of A. niger, thereby limiting the applications of lignocellulosic waste in biorefineries. DTU Biobuilders is set to solve this problem. Using computational tools, we tuned synthetic transcription factors to detect furfural and subsequently activate the expression of heterologous furfural-degrading enzymes in A. niger. This could potentially improve A. niger growth in lignocellulosic waste, thereby unlocking the full potential of lignocellulosic waste as a sustainable carbon source in biorefineries.
https://teams.igem.org/4130	Food & Nutrition	The billion-dollar maple syrup industry produces syrup-based products with values 20 times that of crude oil. However, one in twenty gallons of syrup contains defects that make it unfit for human consumption. Defects include buddy syrup, which has a cabbage-like taste due to metabolic changes in the maple tree, and ropy syrup, which has a stringy texture due to bacterial contamination. These defects are only detected once the sap has been boiled into syrup, wasting valuable resources. Due to inefficient measurement standards, resources are also wasted when measuring glucose levels needed to produce ancillary products. In response, Team Saptasense has developed three sugarmaker-targeted tools to help alleviate financial and environmental costs of syrup and sap defects: a novel method for repurposing ropy syrup into dextran, a sensor kit that detects buddy sap before it is boiled into syrup, and a high-sensitivity glucometer that accurately shows producers precise syrup glucose levels.
https://teams.igem.org/4131	Food & Nutrition	Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death both globally and locally. To tackle CVDs, CCU_Taiwan proposes a PACOmega project combining strategies from two aspects. In the aspect of healthy life, we encouraged people to exercise by holding campus walking and pop-up activities. In the aspect of healthy eat, we collaborated with other iGEM teams to establish the cookbook to decrease the intake of bad oil. To increase the intake of good oil, we generated a new source of Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) supplement by synthetic biology. The EPA production was mediated by pfa genes from Moritella marina and Shewanella pneumatophori. We further applied Acc genes to increase the raw materials of EPA, and chemical cerulenin to inhibit the lipid products competing with EPA. Together, we believed that PACOmega project not only passively protect people from CVDs, but also actively help people to gain a healthy life.
https://teams.igem.org/4132	Manufacturing	Mars is an exciting frontier that beckons exploration. While space technology enables expeditions to the red planet, dust clouds generated upon landing complicate missions and damage equipment. To mitigate dust, we aim to genetically engineer Escherichia coli for use in biocementation, a process that uses urease enzymes to initiate calcium carbonate precipitation to bind sand and particles into cement. Studies indicate that precipitating silica during biosilicification creates silica spheres that stabilize enzyme activity and provide UV protection. We hypothesize that silicification will stabilize urease enzymes and enable biocementation on extraterrestrial surfaces. Therefore, we seek to genetically engineer E. coli to express silicatein genes from sea sponges that will enable silica precipitation. We also aim to improve expression of functional urease enzyme from Sporosarcina pasteurii to generate functional urease activity in E. coli. Producing silica-stabilized urease enzymes (Sili Sand) will yield a sustainable, lightweight, biological solution for dust mitigation on Mars.
https://teams.igem.org/4133	Foundational Advance	A previous Costa Rican iGEM team from 2019 proposed the use of Lactobacillus casei as a chassis for the delivery of their treatment; however, they faced a lot of difficulties during their journey because genetic parts, plasmids, and protocols used in L. casei were not previously characterized. Following this, we looked at the iGEM parts repository, and realized that over 130 iGEM teams have proposed probiotics as a chassis, but many teams came across problems when executing their assays with this probiotic. Given the lack of parts, plasmids and protocols, and the potential of this GRAS microorganism to be engineered and applied in many different industries, we decided to take a step back, and develop a toolbox for L. casei, composed of different genetic parts including inducible and constitutive promoters, RBSs, terminators, reporter proteins, a shuttle vector designed de novo and a killswitch system for biosafety.
https://teams.igem.org/4134	Climate Crisis	An important issue in the climate crisis is global warming caused by massive emissions of greenhouse gases. We noted that microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are a new type of renewable energy that converts the chemical energy of organic matter into electrical energy. It can turn waste organic matter into clean energy, reducing greenhouse gas emissions. But the main problem at present is the unsatisfactory power generation efficiency. Therefore, we designed a silver-binding protein and introduced it into Shewanella. Engineered bacteria can synthesize and enrich silver nanoparticles. Silver nanoparticles can promote electron transfer and bacterial aggregation, effectively improving power generation.
https://teams.igem.org/4135	Food & Nutrition	The CDC estimates 2.8 million drug-resistant infections resulting in 35,000 deaths yearly. Pseudomonads are amongst the most resistant to antimicrobials in plant systems like P. syringae. Drug-resistant microbes have sparked interest in bacteriophage use in plant infections such as P. syringae; a causative agent for multiple diseases. Bacteriophages are predators of bacteria, they have high-host specificity and ability to kill microbes efficiently. Application of phage on crops results in decreased viability as a result of variable environmental conditions including UV and pH levels.Our team isolated two novel P. syringae DC3000 phages from our local agricultural community. We propose modifying the phage capsids through novel methods of CRISPR and BRED to increase capsid rigidity through additions of spy tags on the capsid with spy catcher amino acids to increase capsid protein interactions; increasing protection against variable climates on the plant surface to increase phage viability.
https://teams.igem.org/4136	Environment	With uses ranging from agricultural to industrial, organophosphates are some of the most commonly-used pesticides in the world. However, when these pesticides are improperly managed, they accumulate in wastewater, which may cause harm to human health, wildlife, and the surrounding environment. Moreover, current pesticide degradation methodsFenton and Photo-Fenton treatmentsare costly and unsustainable. Our bioremediation project seeks to use biological processes as an efficient and economic solution for the degradation of organophosphates. Using organophosphate hydrolases (opH and opdB), we aim to genetically engineer two strains of cyanobacteria (PCC 6803 and PCC 7942) to degrade Fenitrothion and Malathion. In order to prevent biocontainment breaches, a controlled cell death system was incorporated into our project. The kill switch is activated in the presence of residual pesticides and their by-products, ensuring that the GMO remains confined to a controlled environment.
https://teams.igem.org/4137	High School	Bananas have teetered on the brink of destruction due to disease - amongst the deadliest pathogen to the Cavendish cultivar is Fusarium oxysporum cubense Tropical Race 4(Foc TR4), which causes Fusarium Wilt. Current solutions to Foc TR4 are insufficient to stop its global spread or to treat disease symptoms. To prevent devastation to the Cavendish banana, our project aims to engineer a B. subtilis biofungicidal rhizobacteria to provide persistent protection against Foc. By engineering SEC-mediated chitinase secretion, the bacteria would induce growth inhibition in Foc. We designed a malate-induced toxin-antitoxin biocontainment system that restricts the bacteria to the banana rhizosphere such that a protective barrier of bacteria is formed to ward off Foc. Beyond solving the specific crisis of bananas, our project serves to spearhead the application of genetic engineering to rhizobacteria as a means of buying time for the development of sustainable agricultural methods to save threatened crops.
https://teams.igem.org/4138	Environment	Phosphorous is an essential element of life. Regarding the decreasing rate of phosphate mining and the waste of phosphate in wastewater, there will soon not be enough to sustain a civilization of ten billion people. Up until now, there is no efficient solution to regain phosphate from wastewater. If humanity fails to recycle phosphate, we will have a wide range of challenges. One problem is the pollution of soils and water with high amounts of phosphate from agricultural and industrial waste. Furthermore, the need for phosphate fertilizers will only grow as the earths population grows. MEtaPhos aims to revolutionize the phosphate cycle by fusing a phosphate-binding protein with a molecular optogenetic switch. By blue light irradiation, we can control the binding and release of phosphate in a highly specific manner. Our goal is to recycle phosphate from wastewater and generate polyphosphate to be reused in the industry.
https://teams.igem.org/4139	Environment	Cyanobacteria, also called blue-green algae, are a group of photosynthetic prokaryotes that form blooms in bodies of water. In Alberta, many lakes are close to farms whose operations release nutrients such as phosphorus, which contribute to the proliferation of cyanobacteria. Overgrowth of harmful algal blooms (HAB) causes damage to aquatic ecosystems, primarily by oxygen consumption and cyanotoxin release during HAB decay. Microcystis aeruginosa (MC) produces the cyanotoxin microcystinLR (MCLR), which is toxic to animals if consumed. Chemical treatments, such as copper sulfate, cause off-target effects to lake organisms. Our objective is to utilize a CRISPR-Cas13a target-specific system contained in a phage-like particle to combat HAB. This system will control overgrowth of cyanoblooms without off-target effects. Furthermore, incorporating the microcystin-degrading enzyme mlrA in our genetic construct mitigates the dangers of MC-LR by peptide linearization. Overall, this provides a treatment method that tackles the harm due to cyanobacteria in aquatic ecosystems.
https://teams.igem.org/4140	WIKI	Phenylketonuria is a metabolic disorder that induces brain damage due to phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency. Herein, we are establishing a diagnostic and therapeutic platform for Phenylketonuria as a prototype for Inborn Errors of Metabolism. The diagnostic approach is achieved via Lateral Flow Assay which provides a cost-effective, accurate, and user-friendly test. We are introducing a novel consumption line in which aptamers-nanoparticles conjugates with pre-specified concentrations consume the normal level of phenylalanine in the sample. The designed aptamers are generated using our directed evolution software tool. Subsequently, the sample passes through the test line that contains a whole cell-based biosensor that releases beta-galactosidase enzyme, providing a semi-quantitative colorimetric signal. This approach uses a CRISPR-regulated therapeutic circuit to control the release of PAH. We introduce a novel Selective Endogenous eNcapsidation for cellular Delivery (SEND) of PAH. Furthermore, safety measures included incorporating anti-CRISPR proteins to control off-targeting actions of Cas proteins.
https://teams.igem.org/4141	Therapeutics	Glioblastoma multiforme is the most common malignant brain tumour. It is considered a rare disease and has the lowest survival rate among all types of cancer. The high recurrence rate and poor prognosis are cause for concern. Is it not tragic, the quality of life glioblastoma patients have! Due to the emerging need for better treatment, our team dedicated itself to finding a precise and effective treatment for GBM. "Theriac", our project, is a molecular tool that aims to target cancer cells with high accuracy, through the detection of two overexpressed microRNAs. The detection of GBM biomarkers leads to the release of two different therapeutic molecules (siRNAs) that will lead to the reduction of the tumour. For the release of siRNAs, we are utilising the Hybridization Chain Reaction (HCR) technique. Theriac is designed to reach glioblastoma cells and cancer stem cells located in brain areas that cannot be accessed surgically.

https://teams.igem.org/4143	Manufacturing	Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a promising alternative to small molecule antibiotics, providing a strategy to address antibiotic resistance. One current limitation to the use of AMPs is that they are difficult to produce by chemical means. Therefore, we have addressed multi-drug resistance by developing a novel, efficient, and scalable method to produce protein-based antibiotics using encapsulins. Our system uses pH sensitive protein nanocompartments to selectively sequester antimicrobial peptides to mitigate toxicity to their host -- E. coli. We generated this system by designing a plasmid construct where an AMP is fused to an encapsulin-specific targeting peptide. Following expression, we extracted and digested the fusion protein to yield a purified antimicrobial peptide. We conclude that this is an inexpensive and scalable method to manufacture antimicrobial peptides that have the potential to supplement or replace current antibiotics, thereby addressing antibiotic resistance.
https://teams.igem.org/4144	Therapeutics	Depression, a common but serious mental disorder, is characterized by constitutive sorrow, loss of interest, guilt and more. Traditionally, patients suffering from depression are treated with different kinds of antidepressants, which may cause side effects and economic and/or mental burden. So our team aims to engineer the probiotic Bifidobacterium longum, which has been demonstrated to reduce depression, to periodically generate a natural metabolite and antidepressant S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) in the gut. To enhance the antidepressant effect of Bifidobacterium longum, Sam2 and Pet8p, the synthetase and transporter of SAMe, respectively, were overexpressed. To mimic drug uptake behavior and regulate plasma concentration, the expression of Sam2 was controlled by an oscillator which is periodically activated. Meanwhile, to ensure safety, a temperature-sensitive redundant kill switch kills the engineered probiotic when it exits human digestive tract, and an AHL-induced kill switch allows the bacteria to be eliminated by AHL ingestion when no longer needed.

https://teams.igem.org/4146	Therapeutics	The scalp microenvironment suffers from a variety of irritations, for which hair loss become a common and distressing symptom. Most functional hair products don't stay on the scalp for more than 30 seconds. We might as well call them cleansing products. In addition, a growing number of people believe that scalp health is closely related to hair growth. Our new idea is to use probiotics to achieve continuous scalp care. E. coli Nissle 1917, engineered by BUCT, consumes aliphatic acids or fatty acids which are one of the main causes of microbial growth and low hair density&#65292;to improve scalp microenvironment. Not only can E. coli stay on the scalp well, but probiotics which synthesize hair growth factors can also promote hair growth. Perfume molecule 2-phenylethyl alcohol is also produced to improve the smell of sebaceous glands and make hair full of fragrance.
https://teams.igem.org/4147	Food & Nutrition	Chilli is responsible for substantial economic gains worldwide and is a key element in Mexican gastronomy. Unfortunately, this crop has reported losses of up to 100% due to wilting. This disease is caused by a phytopathogen complex consisting mainly of Phytophthora capsici and Fusarium oxysporum. Current treatments use different agrochemicals, which put environmental and human health at risk and promote pathogen resistance. We propose a biofungicide containing siRNAs designed to inhibit the production of essential proteins for these pathogens. The defensin DrsB1 with an added chitin binding domain and osmotin PcOSM which destabilize P. capsici and F. oxysporum membranes are also included. These antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and siRNAs will be expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and HT115, respectively. AMPs will be coexpressed with DsbA chaperone to enhance disulfide bond formation. Agrocapsi protects food accessibility and an icon of our identity.

https://teams.igem.org/4149	Foundational Advance	Acid stress conditions are frequently encountered during industrial fermentation as a consequence of the accumulation of acidic metabolites, which calls for more efficient and cost-effective acid-tolerant strains. However, bioleaching microbes have such superb acid resistance that they can thrive in the extremely acidic environment of bioleaching solution. Acidithiobacillus caldus shows the most outstanding ability to resist acid stress. Through a series of literature review and previous experiment, we studied cyclopropane fatty acid synthase (CFAs) gene, the core acid-resistant element of A. caldus, and designed a promoter modification strategy, which was successfully applied in E. coli to improve the acid resistance of chassis cells. In addition, our Hidden Markov Model (HMM) can help to identify &#963;38 dependent promoters in different strains.
https://teams.igem.org/4150	High School	Emerging pandemics like COVID-19 need instant effective vaccines. Currently, the most successful vaccines are equipped in liposome or adenovirus vectors, which are delivered intravenously into human body. Antigen proteins produced through human-self cells trigger immune responses. For immediate use, the protein target from a less-known pathogen to be determined may be physiologically toxic to human cells. Commensal bacteria are normal flora living in humans. What if the antigen gene being transferred into them? Could the antigen protein be produced and be effective to induce immune responses? In our project, we engineered a T7 bacteriophage with a model antigen (ovalbumin) gene. The isolated intestinal E. coli were tested susceptible to the phages and can produce the antigen proteins. We created a model of phage vector - commensal bacteria - antigen production. Based on clinical phage therapy procedure, we are planning to conduct animal studies to examine the effectiveness for phage vaccine.

For example, non-animal-derived antibodies have thus been developed to replace animal-derived antibodies. However, this replacement may lead to the enormous waste of hybridomas, the main manufacturers of animal-derived antibodies. Besides, there are still many problems relating to non-animal-derived antibodies. Therefore, CSMU_Taiwan devise a win-win solution based on optimizing the hybridoma technology. We hope to reduce animal use while simultaneously retaining the advantages of animal-derived antibodies.
https://teams.igem.org/4152	Diagnostics	As a broad spectrum protease, Proteinase K has extremely high enzyme activity and extensive substrate specificity, which is widely used in various fields. Proteinase K is used in nucleic acid extraction to degrade the protein and promote the release of nucleic acid. However, its easy self-degradation and poor stability at room temperature limit its large-scale application. Supported by extensive computer modeling, we applied a series of rational protein engineering strategies to rationally design Proteinase K to enhance its stability. A variety of software and modeling methods including autodock vina and gromacs were used to superimpose and screen multiple mutation points, experimental verification was carried out in the laboratory. Our project makes it possible to use and transport Proteinase K at room temperature, and greatly reduces the cost of using Proteinase K. We are actively seeking commercialization possibilities to expand the impact of our projects and bring benefits to more people.
https://teams.igem.org/4153	Village	The primary detection methods are effective but are expensive and require heavy machines with complex operations. Therefore, we, THINKER_CHINA, with biosensors as our core, are working on designing a better, cheaper, more efficient detection module and reporting module that can be market-oriented. Our biosensor is essentially based on the high specificity of E colis operons and the function of SRRz lysis gene. SRRz is a kind of gene extracted from phages, and the expression of which has the effect of lysing the bacterial cell wall. Bacterial endogenous ß-galactosidase can catalyze the chromogenic reaction of the colorless substrate x-gal. The chromogenic reaction demonstrates a clear pattern of different greyscale values, positively correlated with the intensity of SRRz gene expression. And this operon-induced expression is correlated with the intensity of the objective factors, so different concentrations of the factors result in different greyscale values.
https://teams.igem.org/4154	Therapeutics	Natural products (NPs) have always been a vital source of anticancer medicines. However, NPs exist in complex mixtures, and their modification is typically hindered by complicated chemical structures. The team SeCure aims to apply synthetic biology to the fungal biosynthesis of secalonic acids (SADs), leading to the controllable production of novel bioactive substances. We constructed an artificial biosynthetic pathway by modifying the natural biosynthesis of SAD via the replacement of a short-chain dehydrogenase gene with the gene from the biosynthetic pathway of neosartorin. The engineered pathway was expressed in the fungus Aspergillus oryzae. The isolated metabolites revealed high efficacy against colon cancer in vitro and in vivo. In silico modelling showed that their anticancer potency was linked to their ability to bind human topoisomerase I. As a result of this iGEM project, several team members received an entrepreneurial grant of HK$100,000 to develop this idea into a startup.
https://teams.igem.org/4155	High School	Our project aims to provide a new answer to the problem of zinc contamination with zinc sensors. The modified instrument can sense the concentration of zinc ions in a solution, becoming a sensor similar to a galvanic cell. Depending on the concentration of zinc ions in the solution, the current and voltage in the circuit are changed to measure the concentration of zinc ions in industrial wastewater. In this experiment, we use two kinds of macromolecules, one is riboflavin, and another one is porin. The zinc sensor employs the basic principles of a simple cell. Both the electrodes from the zinc sensor are carbon fiber felt electrodes with E.coli attached to the anode exclusively. The potassium iron cyanide receives electrons in the cathode. The ammeter in the external circuit of electrons measures the magnitude of current due to electrical potential.

Current treatments for colorectal cancer include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy etc. However, the biggest challenge of these therapies is the indiscriminate killing of normal cells. The environment in which tumor cells live is usually characterized by high lactate concentration, low pH and hypoxia. LZU-CHINA takes advantage of this characteristic by introducing three promoters into the probiotic, equipping the strain with an automated tumor targeting system. In order to make the system stable and enhance the specificity of the engineered microbe to kill tumor cells, we also added other genetic components including amplifying genetic logic gate, adhesion factor, killing factor and lysis factor. 2022 LZU-CHINA is dedicated to provide new approaches and ideas for cancer therapy by synthetic biology through gene circuit optimization and construction.

We are aimed to reverse the noninflammatory polarization of tumor associated macrophages with engineered bacteria that can clear away lactic acid from glycolytic metabolism. Engineered E. coli Nissle 1917 bacteria with acid/base inducible promoters are designed to live on lactate, carry monocarboxylate transporters, target cancerous cells and promote phagocytic activities of macrophages. Experimental protocols for determining activities of RNases in tumor and normal tissues and co-culture of cancer cells with bacteria are established. Mathematic models are developed for epidemiological questionnaire and the dynamics of glucose metabolism with chromatographic measurement. Metabolomic and proteomic changes are identified and imaged with mass spectrometry. A prototype portable photoacoustic device and software are developed for the detection of solid tumors. We have been dedicated to raising public awareness, providing educational and social services.

Cell-free biosensors allow targeting wider range of substances than living cells. This year, we aimed to implement the cell-free detection system in the real world. The main targeted stakeholder was women undergoing fertility treatment. Fertility treatment method with higher success rate is strongly desired particularly in Japan with declining birthrate and increasing late-life marriages. This issue is also expected to be serious in other developed countries. The primary goal was to detect two types of female hormones, progesterone and estrogen in the cell-free system. In addition, as for the outputs, we devised a small household sensing device, and a capsule treatment device designed to be driven in uterus. The function of the devices were investigated thorough dry lab modeling. The compatibility of the devised sensors for other substances was also investigated.
https://teams.igem.org/4159	Therapeutics	Chronic wounds are a "hidden epidemic" that place an undue strain on patients and the healthcare system. They often arise as a secondary complication of more persistent health problems. Biofilms are present around 80% of chronic wounds and contribute to their slowed healing. Our project, QBlock, is intended to limit biofilm formation by targeting bacterial communication molecules (i.e. AIPs) that contribute to biofilm formation in Staphylococcus epidermidis by impeding the bacterial communication via DARPins (designed Ankyrin Repeat Proteins), which are synthetic proteins mimicking antibodies. A DNA library of 42 DARPins was generated by altering and randomizing amino acid positions. AlphaFold2 predicted the structure of these DARPins, and the affinity of DARPins towards AIP was experimentally measured via ribosomal display. Control experiments employed a GFP-binding DARPin with a known sequence. Structural predictions and modeling not only confirmed a significant binding with AIP, but also highlighted the diversity and heterogeneity of DARPins.
https://teams.igem.org/4160	Therapeutics	Worldwide 400 million people suffer from autoimmune diseases, of which 1 million are affected by the inflammatory disorder ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV). Current therapies against AAV are based on unspecific immunosuppressive drugs causing burdensome side effects, high healthcare expenditures and workloads, while not excluding disease relapses. To overcome these shortcomings, we designed !MPACT: a Modular and Personalized Autoimmune Cell Therapy. The design was made together with relevant stakeholders, a proof-of-concept was developed in the laboratory, and a kinetic model was built. We engineered mammalian cells that detect the autoantibodies (ANCAs) and subsequently produce the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10, which results in suppression of the autoimmune response. The activity of !MPACT depends on the ANCA concentration, hence, it adjusts to the disease activity, leading to fewer side effects than current therapies, preventing relapses, and reducing healthcare expenditures and workloads. The modularity of the used technology offers great potential to treat many autoimmune diseases.

Antibiotics impose strong selective pressure on the bacteria and degrade host gut microbiome diversity upon treatment. Nanobody displayed on cell surfaces can inhibit the type III secretion system on shigella, thus inhibiting bacterial invasion without imposing strong selective pressure on the bacteria. Probiotics are chosen as hosts for the surface display because of their potential inhibition effects on the pathogenic bacteria and host-friendly characteristics.

However, as the most exterior health indicator, skin loses the care that it should have according to research indicating that over 40% of people have worsened skin health due to a work-life imbalance and a lack of skincare awareness during the pandemic. Our project Rester centers on Vitamin A, an effective skincare reagent but with possible side effects. Our modified cell factories featuring phase separation and enzyme anchoring contain the reaction route of beta-carotene, retinal, and retinol through consecutive enzymatic reactions with appropriate efficiency. It would underlie the production of Vitamin A derivatives that overcome the instability and hazard issues of typical Vitamin A forms in skincare products.

Many of them suffer from further aggravation or even death due to the untimely detection of liver disease. Bile acid, a very popular index to detect liver disease, is used as the substrate of our system. We choose Bss to remove the 3-sulphate sulfate groups of bile acids from the urina sanguinis. So, they can be identified by FXR and activate it. Then, the activated FXR will combine with RXR, driving the downstream ddRFP-A1 and ddRFP-B1 dimerize and emit fluorescence. Finally, we use cell-free system to quantitatively detect urine bile acid content to achieve efficient and home-based detection of liver-related diseases.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) brings about 65% of the dementia cases, it is predicted by DW to be a main cause of death by 2050, especially in the Middle East. Whereas the latter is expected to witness a dementia pandemic during the next decades. Unfortunately, most of the current medications only hinder the progression of the disease. In our project Zekra, we focus on eliminating the causes of the disease by degrading the silent-killer aggregations of tau and amyloid beta (A&#946;) proteins, these aggregates block the neurons communication and trigger neuroinflammation eventually leading to cell apoptosis. We decided to target both tau and amyloid plaques degradation with the help of two systems: one activates the proteasomal degradation cascade intracellularly while the other is a switchable protease system that degrades tau and A&#946; on site, extracellularly.

https://teams.igem.org/4167	High School	Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common chronic psychological disease, resulting in heavy family and social burdens. However, current diagnosis of MDD is mainly based on the patients' description of symptoms, assessment of mental status and evaluation of clinical behaviors, which increase the rate of misdiagnosis. Developing the biomarkers and effective diagnosis method of MDD remains a challenge. Here we report the development of a novel, inexpensive, and portable filter-paper-based biosensor, which can be used to diagnose MDD patients by detecting the abundance of specific microRNA in blood. This biosensor comprises nucleic-acid toehold switches designed to bind to the identified differentially expressed biomarker miRNAs in MDD, namely miR-34a-5p, miR-221-3p and let-7d-3p. Each toehold switch requires a biomarker miRNA-antimiRNA complex to trigger the expression of a marker protein, which could be easily measured. The developed switches may be embedded in a composite biosensor to yield a paper-based device for detecting MDD.

An unhealthy diet will affect the level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and triglyceride in the body, which will lead to the occurrence of a series of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) such as thrombosis. This year, the HZAU-China team hopes that the intestinal content of TMA (trimethylamine), the precursor of TMAO (trimethylamine oxide) and an important factor inducing thrombosis, can be efficiently reduced by using Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 from two aspects: inhibiting the production of TMA and degrading the TMA already existed, so as to reduce the possibility of thrombosis. At the same time, our engineered bacteria will also release some relief substances that are beneficial to vascular protection. The project aims to develop an edible probiotic powder and provide a new idea for cardiovascular disease treatment by intestinal drug therapy.
https://teams.igem.org/4170	Village	Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, affecting both the patients psychology and quality of life, as well as the sound operation of the healthcare systems. Poor lung cancer prognosis due to the delayed diagnosis in advanced stages inspired our team to design DIAS, a low-cost, non-invasive in vitro diagnostic (IVD) device for the early detection of Non-Small Cell lung Cancer. DIAS detection platform is based on the CRISPR/Cas13a system as a nucleic acid amplification (NAA)-free platform for the highly sensitive detection of specific miRNA biomarkers elevated in patients blood. To further enhance the systems sensitivity, we imitated the bioinspired confinement effect by performing the Cas13a detection assays in picoliter-scale microreactors generated via 3D-printed droplet microfluidics. During DIAS project conceptualization our team developed innovative synthetic biology-based methodologies, harnessed engineering tools and applied state-of-the-art technologies towards implementing a Point-of-care IVD device for the early detection of lung cancer.

To avoid high transportation risk caused by radiation, iGEM NCKU_Tainan provides MerSe as a state-of-art solution by synthesis biology to protect bacteria or cells from radiation exposure. Being able to produce selenomelanin using the 21st amino acid selenocysteine and melanin, Se coli shows superior radiation resistance. To further apply Se coli as a bio-factory, we produce gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) alongside selenomelanin. After UV exposure, Se coli shows a higher survival rate compared to both non-melanized and melanin-producing E. coli. We also develop a device called MerStage to mimic radiation exposure, cell aggregation, and 3D cell culture to evaluate the biological effects of bacteria. To integrate biomanufacturing, technology, and society approach into the deep future, we focus on real-life circumstances and build a comprehensive solution.

Currently, copper from agricultural, industrial and mining waste is released into the aquatic environment, posing a serious threat to the stability of ecosystems. The lack of effective early warning tools for copper contamination has resulted in many negative impacts. For this purpose, Escherichia coli BL21 was genetically modified to carry the promoters pcutR, OprF and ribB, the cell membrane permeability of the engineered strain was increased, and its riboflavin production was positively correlated with the copper ion concentration, and then the biosynthetic strain was used for Biosensors based on microbial fuel cells provide a better method for the detection of copper ion-contaminated water bodies.
https://teams.igem.org/4173	Therapeutics	Alopecia is a skin disorder occurs in a wide population, often causing damaging psychological consequences. The NJU-China iGEM team chose to focus on androgenetic alopecia (AGA), which exhibits the highest prevalence. Current drugs on the market for treating AGA produce unstable results and cause various side effects. Our team began with a comprehensive study of its molecular mechanism then selected several genetic targets. Our goal was to develop a drug with minimal side effects, stable results, and ease of use. On the one hand, we applied RNAi technique and mRNA embedding elements to regulate gene expression particularly. On the other hand, we used sEV (extracted by Tangential Flow Filtration and bind-elute size exclusion chromatography) and microneedles to carry and deliver siRNA and mRNA to follicle cells. Furthermore, apart from AGA, our research may also pave the way for an sEV-mediated systemic delivery platform of therapeutic cargo for other dermatologic diseases.
https://teams.igem.org/4174	Village	To address the broadest array of global problems, synthetic biology will need to move beyond the laboratory and into the field. However, multiple barriers impede the deployment of fieldable systems in soil, water, or living tissues. One initial barrier is selecting an optimal and safe chassis for a specific environment. While computational tools provide data-driven predictions to inform other aspects of the synthetic biology design process, mathematical models and associated software to assist with chassis selection for a specific environment are lacking. To meet this need, the W&M iGEM team designed a predictive model using multivariate regression and neural networks to help scientists with chassis selection for soil, water, air, and the gut microbiome. Based on input type, our software predicts the optimal chassis for a specific environment or the most favorable environment for a predetermined chassis, leading to safer, more effective, fieldable, and robust genetic circuits.
https://teams.igem.org/4175	Therapeutics	Massive cellular senescence is accompanied by the onset of various age-related diseases leading to irreversible aging. Previous studies have demonstrated that removal of senescent cells can reverse aging. Tissue fibrosis is a aging hallmark, characterized by senescent fibroblasts. Furthermore, based on single-cell data analysis and immunochemistry, DPP4 were highly expressed on the surface of aged fibroblasts rather than on young fibroblasts. To address the concerns and reverse senescence-associated phenotypes, we designed a novel and efficient system for removal of these senescent fibroblasts with the help of assembled DPP4-targeting CAR-T immunotherapy. Due to the side effects of CAR-T system, cytokine release syndrome (CRS), we have also designed a negative feedback circuit with detecting the concentration of IL-6, markers of CRS. With the constant function of our project, anti-aging CAR-T, the harmful senescent fibroblasts are eradicated without severe side effects and the grand vision of rejuvenating with one shot will be realized.
https://teams.igem.org/4176	Foundational Advance	CRISPR/Cas system has been successfully harnessed for programmable RNA-guided genome editing in many fields. But CRISPR-based genome engineering strategies have off-target cleaves, variable gRNA efficiency, protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) specificity and other problems. These hinder us obtaining strains that are accurately edited, prolonging the time of strain construction and screening, costing more manpower and materials. Here, we developed a CRISPR-based purification system strainer, which utilizes double stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) as a signal to start the transcription of gRNA targeting on the plasmid harboring inducible toxic gene SacB. Then, only the strain with DSBs and recombineering can survive in the media with sucrose, because SacB converts sucrose to levan that is toxic to E. coli, thereby improving the overall editing efficiency during the genome engineering process. We then applied strainer for an isopropanol high-producing strain construction efficiently. Strainer can be potentially used as an universal method for cell factory construction.
https://teams.igem.org/4177	Environment	Toxoptera aurantii, also known as tea aphid, is widely distributed in Jiangsu, Guangdong province and so on. In addition to harming tea trees and oil tea,it also do damage to citrus, litchi, etc. In our project, we will introduce the gene of the G protein-coupled receptor HarmOR10 from Helicoverpa armigera into yeast. Then we will use our engineered bacteria to detect benzaldehyde secreted by tea trees after Toxoptera aurantii infestation and release the sex pheromones of Toxoptera aurantii whose composition including nepetalactone and nepetalactol. We also hope that the nepetalactone and nepetalactol are in a ratio which is as close as possible to the ratio of the components of the tea aphid sex pheromone. This project is aimed at Interfering with the mating of Toxoptera aurantii and attracting natural enemies of Toxoptera aurantii, which will ultimately reduce the infestation of Toxoptera aurantii in tea plantations.

https://teams.igem.org/4179	Manufacturing	Angelica Gigas is a plant well known in Asia for its medicinal properties, which are attributed to decursin. Decursin was identified as a novel agent for the treatment of many medical conditions, as well as a promising candidate for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced alopecia (hair loss), one of the most distressing side effects for cancer patients. Nowadays, decursin is expensive and inaccessible due its low-yielding and polluting extraction, alongside the seasonal nature of the plant. To address this issue, we chose to bio-manufacture decursin in bacteria. We designed a synthetic circuit encoding for three enzymes that catalyze the two penultimate reactions in the anabolic pathway. This will make the production of decursin cheap and sustainable and enable therapeutic applications to be further explored. Finally, we engineered a biosensor that could quantify decursin. This can be used by future teams that investigate molecules that affect the Hippo signaling pathway.
https://teams.igem.org/4180	Village	Obesity is a severe threat to the world with the rocketing obese population. Our project aims to reduce obesity rates by identifying supplements that possess environmental-stress-related-phenotype-mitigating properties with a similar model as viability assay for cancer drug testing research using engineered yeast with overexpression SNF1(the homologous yeast gene of AMPK, a metabolism sensor gene in humans). We tested the effectiveness of our product with supplements from local products in Taiwan proven to have anti-obesity and metabolism-boosting properties such as green tea and brown algae, containing Catechins and Fucoxanthin respectively. With our design, possible synergistic effects between overexpression SNF1 and nutrient samples could mitigate the environmental-stress-related-phenotypes more significantly, allowing us to effectively test the possible environmental-stress-related-phenotype-mitigating properties of supplements.
https://teams.igem.org/4181	WIKI	In the era of mankind striding towards the deep space, we are exploring the intriguing combination of DNA data storage technology and the novel application scenario of interstellar communication with the help of synthetic biology. To achieve it, we will firstly establish an improved method derived from Yin-Yang Codec System to encode massive information that will be transported within bacterial genome. Secondly, spore display technology and bioengineering transformation system are employed to engineer spores from B.subtilis with Dsup proteins and melanin to establish an information container with stronger resistance to radiations, especially GCR which may break DNAs when exposed. Finally, information retrieval rate will be analyzed by specific algorithm after experiments simulating the cosmic environment on those information-stored spores for a substantive demonstration of our design.
https://teams.igem.org/4182	Environment	We provide an environmentally friendly bio-fertilizer, attempting to solve the problems caused by the widespread use of chemical herbicides by synthetic-biology. An engineered E. coli is constructed with the ability to produce a novel herbicide- aspartic acid and exopolysaccharides(EPS) under blue-light, and to controllably release them into soil triggered by heat, which will avoid excessive use and possible residue of herbicide, also promote water conservation and sand fixation by EPS. Our system consists of a precursor plasmid that converts the glucose to the key precursor GPP, and multiple functional plasmids with the ability to synthesize herbicide and EPS under the control of blue-light. Meanwhile, our engineered cells will release herbicide and EPS with the expression of a lysis gene under a higher temperature above 42oC. About 10% of the bacteria will escape the lysis procedure and recover, promoting a new round of controllable production and release of herbicide and EPS.
https://teams.igem.org/4183	High School	Lactose intolerance is a prevalent issue that cannot be overlooked. As much as 75% of the worlds human population is intolerant to ingested dietary lactose. We decided to use E. coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) as our chassis and make it synthesize &#946;-galactosidase (lacZ) with a secretory signal peptide, which can effectively prevent lactose uptake by EcN. Second, we plan to use enteric-coated pills to contain the freeze-dried bacteria for ingestion which helps the bacteria bypass the chemical barrier the gastric acid imposes and ensures safe transport to the intestines. Third, we aim to create a protective film using CAP (capsular polysaccharides surrounding) to ensure that the bacteria safely implant themself in the intestinal environment without damage. The CAP helps the bacteria adapt to a wider range of temperature and pH, shuts out harmful chemicals and toxins, as well as assisting them to stick to the intestinal walls.
https://teams.igem.org/4184	Village	"Early detection offers the best chances of cure". This statement is true for many diseases. However, early detection of disease is not always possible and is often limited by inadequate diagnostic methods and technologies.  We, the iGEM team Braunschweig, have set ourselves the goal of developing a system that can detect minute amounts of disease-relevant antigen using a self-amplifying system.  LionDetect consists of three components. The detection component which recognizes and binds antigens by using scFv fragments. This component forms an active protease, which activates the following amplification component and reporter component. As soon as the reporter component is activated, a signal is detectable by a FRET pair. In addition, a large part of our work is dedicated to raising awareness about esophageal cancer. Individuals suffering from this disease show symptoms at a late stage, which in many cases are not associated with esophageal cancer at first.
https://teams.igem.org/4185	Environment	Droughts and water shortages are becoming more frequent due to climate change. Accordingly, our team had to design a novel method of water desalination to solve the ongoing challenge of water scarcity, building on earlier efforts. Current desalination systems use fossil fuels, an expensive process that emits greenhouse gases. Our strategy is to create an energy-efficient solution. We accomplish this by genetically altering marine cyanobacteria to take up more salt. The NpHR pump is responsible for Cl- removal, and we went one step further by adding a pH-dependent antiporter in charge of Na+ absorption. The pump's activity is controlled by green light, and our strains are enclosed in beads to offer a biocontainment system. Relying on our models, we demonstrate that our modified cyanobacteria can desalinate with minimal energy use. Hence, industries and water management firms have shown great interest in the project, generating new prospects for water security.
https://teams.igem.org/4186	Manufacturing	Underlying mineral deposits, weathered debris, pathfinding elements such as iron or arsenic can serve as geochemical signals for the detection of gold deposits. The process of gold prospecting is time-consuming, costly and environmentally destructive. For instance, in low-income countries such as Ghana, open trenches are left by disappointed small-scale miners Our project seeks to reduce environmental degradation and time by engineering a number of E-Coli that separately detects the presence of Au and some selected pathfinder elements (As and Fe) that signal gold prospects in a location. These bacteria will be co-cultured to create a multifunctional biosensor. The engineered organisms are encapsulated in hydrogel spheres which will be placed in a stake which can driven into the soil up to 1-2m in depth to asses the presence of gold deposits. UV induced promoters which control lysozymes are incorporated in the biosensor to ensure bio-safety.
https://teams.igem.org/4187	Climate Crisis	StarchLight aims at upgrading brewers spent grain, a largely available waste produced by the beer brewing industry, into a power source. The innovative microbial fuel cell goal is to both store energy and to produce electricity by using spent grain as its sole power source. Eventually, StarchLight wants to provide brewers a solution to reduce their carbon footprint while getting rid of the unwanted waste they generate. The StarchLight device relies on two bacterial strains: Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Shewanella oneidensis (S.oneidensis). To use spent grain as a power source, we designed a system based around the genetic engineering of E.coli: it degrades the starch in spent grain into lactate, stores it intracellularly as polylactate, and delivers lactate on-demand to S.oneidensis. S. oneidensis can then use the lactate to produce electricity by means of chain electron transfers in its inner membrane.
https://teams.igem.org/4188	Manufacturing	Monoterpenoids are versatile biomolecules with broad applications in healthcare, agriculture, and consumer products. However, large-scale applications remain rare, as traditional production methods rely on extraction from plants and chemical synthesis. This makes monoterpenoid production expensive and unsustainable. Microbial production of monoterpenoids is a promising alternative, but poor precursor availability, complicated expression of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYPs), and product toxicity limit their potential. MonChassis is overcoming current limitations by increasing precursor availability in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Yarrowia lipolytica by metabolic engineering, compartmentalization, and creating a cell-free, electrically-driven CYP system to circumvent product toxicity. With this, we established an adaptable platform for monoterpenoid production, allowing further deployment of monoterpenoids in unexplored areas. As a proof-of-concept , we produced verbenone, used to fight bark beetle invasion in forests locally, and globally. Thereby, MonChassis not only establishes a flexible production method for monoterpenoids without using plants but also contributes to the conservation of forests.
https://teams.igem.org/4189	Environment	The pollution of our oceans and seas has intensified upon the excessive use of plastic in our daily lives and industrial and commercial activities. The Mediterranean is one of the world's most polluted seas, mainly because its almost entirely enclosed by land. Its surface waters contain 84,800 microplastics per km2, which increases yearly, endangering the marine ecosystem. Our project, of global and local scope, aims to degrade the most abundant microplastics in this sea, namely polyethene, polystyrene, and polypropylene. It is about engineering a "plasticosome", a large bacterial extracellular multienzyme complex which degrades plastic. The particularity of this complex will be its specificity to recognise plastic through plastic adherent peptides that we have tested and specific VHH antibodies that we have found. We are also committed to raise public awareness on the issues surrounding the widespread use of plastics and plastic waste management while considering health, social and environmental challenges.
https://teams.igem.org/4190	Therapeutics	Diabetes Mellitus affects roughly 1 in 10 people globally and is the worlds seventh leading cause of death. However, 50 to 85% of all chronic complications are preventable by treatment and medication. Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists, such as Exendin-4, are one of the leading forms of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2D) treatments but are exceedingly expensive. Our initial studies used E. coli as an experimental model for Exendin-4 production; successes in those experiments led to homologous integration of Exendin-4 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae). As S. cerevisiae is Generally Regarded As Safe (GRAS) by the U.S. FDA, we hypothesize that Helo, once bio-encapsulated, can be administered as an oral T2D therapeutic. Our goal is for Helo to become an affordable T2D medication that can be propagated in as little as one square meter of space and distributed globally for communities and pharmacies to produce.

Open-air stone cultural relics, exposed outdoors for a long time, are susceptible to weathering damage. Nevertheless, parts of Lingyin Temple, a temple built from stone more than 1,000 years ago, are still intact due to the presence of natural calcium oxalate protective film. Inspired by this instance, CAU_China plan to use Bacteria-Induced Mineral Precipitation (BIMP) to replicate this protective film, by engineering Pseudomonas fluorescens to make it produce oxalic acid and consequently form a dense calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) protective film with the assistance of EPS. The realization of this technique will be a historical advance in the protection of stone relics, and will be the well-being of all cultural heritage stakeholders, present and future.
https://teams.igem.org/4193	WIKI	Nowadays, strain quality has become a major factor limiting the yield of fermentation industry. The engineering bacteria degenerate into wild-type due to mutation or some unknown endogenous regulation. They have more growth advantages than the production engineering bacteria and gradually occupy resources to become the dominant species. The production genes introduced into the engineering bacteria are copied and lost in the process of DNA replication during cell proliferation. At the same time, some products accumulate in the engineering bacteria, which has a negative feedback regulation effect on the production of enzymes. Moreover, the extraction process of the products by breaking the engineering bacteria is very complicated. We plan to design a software and hardware platform that automatically regulates the production and screening of strains to extract product simply to ensure high-quality strains and improve the fermentation yield.

Our project intends to research cultured meat, to provide a new technology for the development of food safety, food hygiene, and standardized food production. Therefore, our design includes producing scaffold materials and cultivating muscle cells. Firstly, to reduce the influence of metabolic disturbance, E.coli with the autonomous dynamic regulation function was constructed to produce PHFA and provide raw materials for the scaffold system. Besides, to meet up with the challenge of the high-cost 3D-print scaffold can't be industrialized, the method of cell culture by microspheres is proposed, which greatly promotes the process of industrial large-scale production. As a result, our project will improve the human nutritional diet, reduces global carbon emissions, and also be a firm source of intergalactic colonialization.
https://teams.igem.org/4195	Food & Nutrition	Shrimp is a delicious seafood favored around the world. However, the threat of acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND) has caused a devastating impact on the shrimp aquaculture industry. AHPND is caused by Vibrio parahaemolyticus carrying pVA1 plasmid. The conventional approaches for preventing and curing AHPND either have limited success, or are unsustainable in the long-term. Also, a rapid detection method is in urgent need. Therefore, XMU-China offers OMEGA. It includes detection, treatment and prevention of AHPND. First, Recombinase Polymerase Amplification technology and cell-free system are employed to detect toxin genes in the water sample. Then engineered outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are applied to target and deliver plasmids encoding endolysin into the pathogen, treating the disease. For prevention, OMVs with surface displayed receptors are further used to competitively bind to the PirA/PirB, preventing cell damage. CRISPR/Cas system is further utilized to destroy pirA/pirB gene, achieving the virulence loss of Vibrio parahaemolyticus.

Today, the number of detected allergens is still limited, resulting in undiagnosed allergies. Our project proposes an innovative approach to detect Immunoglobulins E (IgE) in the patients blood and so, the predisposition to any allergy. This method is based on the specific aggregation of engineered Escherichia coli strains in presence of IgE. We produced the strains, modeled interactions and used state-of-the-art technologies for high-throughput screening. While there is still room for optimization, the method is a major step towards detection of any allergy and the production of custom-made treatments. We identified that patients and their relatives seldomly know what allergies are about. So, we engaged in a deep educational effort including a series of videos named Cracking Allergies, as it is what we firmly intend to do!

By introducing double plasmids into EcN, ChuA(heme transporter), HrtR(Lactococcus heme reactive transcription inhibitor), promoter HrtO and pigment genes were introduced into engineering probiotics. By taking probiotics to act on the intestines, when there is a small amount of intestinal bleeding, ChuA will transport the heme in the intestines to E. coli and combine with hrtr to affect the transcription and expression of the hrto promoter, and express the pigment gene . Finally, detect whether there is pigment to determine whether there is trace bleeding.
https://teams.igem.org/4200	Food & Nutrition	Vibriosis is a bacterial disease primarily observed in marine, estuarine, and occasionally, freshwater fish. It is caused by the bacteria of the genus Vibrio and is a significant reason for mortality in pisciculture operations. Among this species, Vibrio parahaemolyticus is one of the most prevalent pathogens. The problem remains substantial despite the pre-existing solutions like antibiotics, vaccines, and over-the-counter medicines. For this reason, we intend to design a sustainable alternative to them by synthesising an antimicrobial peptide that will bind to the Multivalent Adhesion Molecule 7 (MAM7)a surface protein present on the bacteria. MAM7 is responsible for bacterial adhesion to the host's epithelial cells, triggering the infection. Hence, by inhibiting adhesion, the infection will be prevented in its primary stage, consequently rendering the bacteria harmless to the fish. Our peptide would be synthesised by our chassisBL21, and delivered using chitosan nanoparticles.

In the experiment, it was introduced into Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the auditory module was constructed. We transformed the designed plasmid into Escherichia coli for amplification and culture, and then transferred into yeast for yeast transformation by plasmid extraction. Yeast DNA was extracted for PCR verification, followed by electrophoresis verification. Finally, the transformers were prepared and frozen in glycerol tubes. By studying this life phenomenon, we conducted the first round of research for the project of sensing cancer, and preliminary exploration for the subsequent research of sound transduction in microorganisms.

These two systems will be assembled by mixing purified LysPBC5 and Cas12b to form an efficient B. cereus test kit. To lower the cost of protein purification, we employed Pro-QC and crystal violet inducible protein expression system by reducing incomplete transcripts and the cost of inducer. Our design of the test kit could also guide the development of methods to detect other pathogens in the future.

As plant infections can rarely be visualized at early phases of plant-pathogen encounter, we sought to devise a bioassay kit that could identify an infection before phenotypic symptoms arise. For this purpose we developed a low-cost cell-free system to be used on-site, based on exchangeable toehold switches that respond to pathogen-specific gene sequences. As a demonstration, we built a novel toehold switch for detecting barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV), and compiled a library of alternative switches towards other pathogens to showcase system modularity. Reporter plasmids harboring the BYDV toehold switch were successfully constructed, and the reporter protein expression without the toehold was shown to work in a cell-free system. Although the function of the toehold-reporter combinations could not be verified, several iterations of system testing allowed us to pinpoint critical issues for the next steps of the assay development.

The current detection methods are laborious and require expensive chromatography and mass spectrometry equipment. This why in our project we aimed to develop an E.coli biosensor for a cheaper and easier detection of Anatoxin-a.

Then by engineering Escherichia coli to produce zosteric acid, an antifoulant compound that will prevent mussels attachment to surfaces. We successfully created plasmids expressing enzymes for zosteric acid production. They are now ready for testing and optimization. We also cloned several constructs to overexpress FitD. In our experiments with the mussels, we demonstrated that our engineered bacteria can indeed kill the mussels and we identified the most potent construct.

We demonstrated our biosensors target could be extended to fenitrothion, a second pesticide, with only minor changes. To enhance pyrethroid breakdown, we engineered a whole cell catalyst utilising a carboxylesterase from Bacillus velezensis. To improve activity and improve membrane insertion, we linked the carboxylesterase to a modified anchor protein isolated from Pseudomonas syringae. To explore growth-production trade-offs we developed an ordinary differential equation model of microbial gene expression and growth. Working under guidance from farmers and other stakeholders, we developed a spatial model to enable the optimisation of potential deployment strategies in the field.

The excellent properties of bacterial cellulose (BC) make it to be qualified as a high-quality tissue engineering scaffold. However, cellulose is non-degradable in vivo, which is a knotty problem that restricts its application at present. BCAID provides a solution in synthetic biology for the real application of BC tissue engineering scaffolds in human body, which is of great significance for repairing skin tissue wounds.

A major source of yield loss are fungal pathogens, constituting 75% of all plant diseases. Current solutions are falling short, with farmers relying on unselective spraying of fungicides due to delayed emergence of visible symptoms, often missing the early stages of infection when treatment is most effective. We propose Sporadicate, a broad-spectrum biofungicide based on Bacillus subtilis spores that eliminates the time-lag between diagnosis and treatment. Our bacterial spores are engineered to display chitinase enzymes on the surface, which degrade the cell wall of pathogenic fungi. This generates a biomarker that can be detected via a modified receptor  enabling spores to selectively germinate into vegetative cells exhibiting biocontrol properties. Given the innate durable properties of spores, our system would be robust, easily storable, widely applicable, and cost-effective.

Inorganic phosphate accumulation in water causes the formation of harmful algal blooms that produce cyanotoxins, leading to aquatic ecosystem deterioration. Our team aims to develop a universal monitoring and phytoremediation approach for eutrophic waters. The monitoring system will evaluate the ecological status of the water body and, wherever it indicates critical levels of eutrophication, a constructed floating wetland (CFW) will be implemented. The CFW will be made of biodegradable mycelium carrying genetically engineered plants. Once plant roots detect cyanotoxins via a novel synthetic riboswitch, they will overexpress PHT1 transporters that will enhance phosphate uptake. Plant shoots and leaves will stand over the CFW and will be eventually harvested and converted into fertilizer.

Patients with PA develop autoantibodies against Intrinsic Factor (IF) or IF-producing parietal cells.. Both of these types result in malabsorption of dietary B12 and result in B12 deficiency in the long term. Currently, high dosage B12 is administered to patients intravenously, intramuscularly and to a lesser extent orally, to circumvent malabsorption. Our solution aims to treat PA with a protein therapeutic consisting of an engineered IF which has phenotype-improving mutations in the autoantibody-binding epitope. Successful mutants were generated using site-directed mutagenesis and were surface displayed in mammalian cells to validate the autoantibody and B12 binding. In the future, we are aiming to offer our treatment in the form of pills which include IF bound to B12 for optimised absorption of vitamin B12 and thus, increasing the quality of life for the patients.

https://teams.igem.org/4216	Village	Language originating from the field of electronics is often employed in synthetic biology to describe genetic logic circuits, meanwhile, the real intersection of electronics with genetics remains largely unexplored. Our iGEM team is developing a toolkit of genetic parts with the concomitant open-source hardware to enable synthetic biologists to interface bacterial gene expression with electronics. Our toolkit incorporates a multitude of genetic parts from previous research in electro-microbiology that have been standardised to allow for a wide variety of applications. We are conversely researching new means of bioelectronic control using hyperpolarization of bacterial membranes for gene induction. Our toolkit will open doors for foundational research in gene expression and control while finding applications in manufacturing, robotics, arts and new media.
https://teams.igem.org/4217	Environment	Manganese above World Health Organization limits is associated with neurologic dysfunction and Parkinsons-like disease. Despite the increase in manganese discharges from industrial runoffs and the resulting increase in manganese contamination of water sources, applications for the detection and bioremediation of manganese are not widely available, cost-effective, or easy to maintain. We are developing an E.coli expressed biosensor for the detection of manganese contamination in water samples. The sensor consists of a manganese-responsive promoter and riboswitch driving expression of a superfolder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP). The sensor is currently capable of detecting manganese down to 1mM, and efforts are underway to increase its sensitivity. Once the system is optimized, we plan to replace sfGFP with phytochelatin as a means of chelating manganese from drinking water. It is our hope that our system will provide a cost-effective and fieldable alternative to existing means of manganese detection and removal.
https://teams.igem.org/4218	High School	Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are the commonest hematologic malignancies in the elderly. Now, the accurate diagnosis of MDS still heavily rely on the experienced hematologists morphological evaluation of peripheral blood and bone marrow cells. Therefore, it is urgent to develop more effective detection methods for MDS diagnosis. Aberrant splicing is strongly associated with MDS. Many RNA splicing-related genes have been found to mutate in around 50% of MDS patients, suggesting analysis of RNA splicing status should be used for diagnosis of MDS. It is reported that exons of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 7 (MAP3K7) and zinc finger protein 91 (ZFN91) were skipped in MDS patients. This inspired us of constructing sensors fused the skipping exons into the plasmids containing reporter, which monitors the alteration of RNA splicing in cells. Our project provides a simple and effective method for early diagnosis and prediction of prognosis in MDS in the future.
https://teams.igem.org/4219	Foundational Advance	The use of RNA as a therapeutic tool is a new frontier of disease treatment, but for it to be safe, therapeutic mRNA translation must be limited to a specific cell type. Commonly, delivery vehicles are used to target cells according to cellular membrane characteristics, but such methods have many limitations, including insufficient specificity. A switch module on the 5 UTR of the mRNA that senses and responds to a specific endogenous RNA trigger in the target cell, can be used in parallel to enhance specificity. To date, such a switch module has been used successfully in prokaryotes, including by many IGEM teams, but not in eukaryotes, and tools to design them efficiently are lacking. We are creating an innovative, user-friendly, generic software tool for designing switch modules in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes using new algorithms and models which will assist in generating efficient, selectively translated mRNA molecules.
https://teams.igem.org/4220	WIKI	RSPOs (R-spondins) belong to a family of secreted proteins that was the leading cause of various cancers. In iGEM2022, NEU_CHINA team focused on developing a novel cancer targeted-therapy against all RSPOs. We originally designed and characterized a chimeric protein RTAC (RSPO-Targeting Anti-cancer Chimeric protein) through protein engineering. RTAC showed satisfactory anti-cancer effect through inhibition of RSPO-mediated Wnt/&#946;-catenin signaling activation. For further improvement, a S.Cerevisiae-based probiotic was engineered, named as R-yeast, to deliver RTAC to RSPO-hyperactivated colorectal cancer locally. The mating pathway of R-yeast was reprogrammed to specifically sense the tumor environment-specific molecules, thus expressing RTAC in a self-tunable manner. Meanwhile, a unique copper-dependent kill switch was implanted to avoid R-yeast from causing potential environmental hazard. Collectively, we have presented the proof-of-concept of a novel anti-pan-RSPO protein and a probiotic with self-controllable machineries for cancer targeted treatment. Our work thus promises great value in synthetic biological research and translational medicine.
https://teams.igem.org/4221	High School	Hydrophobins are small surface-active amphiphilic proteins that contain both hydrophobic and hydrophilic areas on their surface. They can self-assemble to form a stable film at the interface of both polar and non-polar solution phases. Thanks to high surface activity and amphiphilicity, Hydrophobins have broad application prospects as surfactants in interface engineering, emulsifiers in food processing, bioimmobilization agents in nanotechnology, and powerful protein purification tags in biotechnology. Our project features BslA, a bacterial-origin hydrophobin with great potential and wide application in synthetic biology. BslA is much easier to produce compared to their fungal-origin cousins, which overcomes the limitations of their industrial use. We hope to unleash the potential of BslA and solve some of the major concerns of the synbio community and humanity as a whole. To this end, Our team designed three BslA fusion proteins that target three problems: protein purification, antibiotic abuse, and plastic pollution.

https://teams.igem.org/4223	Diagnostics	Since the discovery of penicillin by Fleming in 1929, antibiotic research has developed rapidly and the large-scale use of antibiotics has brought about serious problems of microbial resistance. Combined with human activities, the cross-species and cross-habitat spread of drug-resistant microorganisms and antibiotic-resistant genes occurred at the"Human-marine animal-environment" interface. Antibiotics and their metabolites were enriched in the environment, spread to human by marine animals and animal products, produced drug-resistant microorganisms and caused the spread of drug-resistant genes,which has been a serious impact on human health. At present, there is no rapid detection instrument in the field of marine environmental monitoring to characterize microbial resistance in seawater. Based on the combination of CRISPR/CAS system and CSM6 protein, we identify mutagenic genes with single-base precision,detect specific drug-resistant genes in marine microorganisms and develop a platform for rapid detection of drug resistance in marine microorganisms.
https://teams.igem.org/4224	High School	Lactose intolerance indicates intestinal discomfort caused by decreased beta-galactosidase to digest lactose. Since lactase hydrolyses lactose into glucose and galactose, when the expression of lactase declines due to genetic disorder or natural ageing, the amount of lactose people can tolerate will decrease. It is a worldwide health problem that about 70% of the world population suffered from lactose intolerance. Notably, the incidence is particularly high in Asia because the downward trend of expressing lactase is strengthened by diets rarely containing lactose. In the dairy industry, Aspergillus oryzae is one of the most widely used fungal sources of beta-galactosidase (lacA) to produce lactose-free products for people with lactose intolerance. To allow people with lactose intolerance to enjoy dairy products, our project aims to express lacA heterologously in Pichia pastoris, quantify the enzymatic property of lacA, and optimise the culture conditions of recombined Pichia pastors.
https://teams.igem.org/4225	Food & Nutrition	Fresh seafood products are highly susceptible to spoilage, so it is important to monitor their quality throughout storage and delivery. We aim to create a colorimetric biosensor that detects bioamine levels in raw fish, as high levels of bioamines signify the degradation of meat quality and cause bioamine poisoning. Our circuit detects the bioamine levels by converting them into H2O2 with rat diamine oxidase. H2O2 subsequently oxidizes the transcription factor OxyR, activating the katG promoter, which drives the expression of a red output. Essentially, the system turns green if the fish is safe to consume and red when it is spoiled. We use an E. coli-based cell-free system as the detection mechanism in our biosensor and a swab test will be done for extracting the final sample by users. Compared to current products, our biosensor will be a more ready-to-use, intuitive, and robust indicator of fresh fish quality.

https://teams.igem.org/4227	Therapeutics	Oral problems are widespread among people of different ages. Most oral problems can be preventable and treated in their early stages, especially for the universal tooth decay deduced by Streptococcus mutans. This project is seeking a low-cost and convenient way to prevent oral diseases by developing oral probiotics based on GRAS strain-Bacillus subtilis. With introduction of quorum sensing system from S. mutans, the switch of our designed genetic circuits would be triggered by sensing competence-stimulating peptide (CSP, quorum sensing signaling molecule with concentration positively correlated with the number of S. mutans).Our Healthy Teeth Legion project designed multiple genetic circuits to achieve the purpose of detecting oral hygiene and preventing dental caries, as well as achieving convenient feedback of test results. For safety reasons, termination switch has been added accordingly. With combination of scientific research, computer modeling and extensive experimental data,more reliable and convenient Healthy Teeth Legion would be developed.
https://teams.igem.org/4228	Manufacturing	Bromelain is a plant protease which has a variety of properties, including anti-cancer activity, anti-inflammatory effect, antimicrobial effect, antibiotic potentiation, skin protection, postsurgery recovery and so on. It has a wide range of applications in the medical and food fields. Even though bromelain has great application potential, the traditional production process has issues of inefficiency, unstable source and low enzyme activity. Bplant replaced the traditional technique by synthetic biology and improved both enzymatic activity and stability by directed evolution. In the filed of fodder processing, bromelain can transform protein in feed into polypeptides and small peptides that are easy for animals to digest and absorb. It brings a variety of benefits like improving feed conversion efficiency, enhancing animal disease resistance and reducing the use of antibiotics as antibiotic substitute. In this application scenario, we hope to use Bacillus subtilis as bromelain production plant for safety consideration.
https://teams.igem.org/4229	Foundational Advance	Despite their small size, bacteria have sophisticated and dynamic internal organization, featuring distinct microenvironments optimized for a given task, such as carboxysomes that perform CO2 fixation. We aimed to engineer and compare different compartmentalization systems (rigid shells and liquid droplets) for their ability to localize enzymes and promote metabolic processes due to reduced formation of toxic side-products and more efficient interplay between pathway components thanks to physical proximity. Using computational structural biology, we predicted sites at which the incorporation of a non-canonical amino acid (ncAA) could influence pore size. To facilitate the use of ncAAs for future iGEM teams, we developed INCLUSIVE, a database collecting the important information from the literature. Furthermore, we investigated the impact of genome reduction on compartment formation and metabolic pathway output. In conclusion, our project lays the foundations for using compartmentalization as a tool to exploit the full power of bacterial cells.

https://teams.igem.org/4231	Therapeutics	Lipid nanoparticle (LNP) is a novel pharmaceutical drug delivery system and a novel pharmaceutical formulation. But this promising drug delivery system has no effect on many cerebral diseases due to the difficulty in drug delivery across the bloodbrain barrier (BBB). In our project, we developed Bor-NP, a novel nanoparticle modified by borneol, which has been proved with the ability to enhance other drugs transport across the BBB. At the same time, we tried to establish a system which can mass-produce this kind of Bor-NP. We took advantage of Yarrowia lipolytica to boost the borneol production, and then conjugate these borneol to the succinimide group of N-hydroxy succinimidepoly(ethyleneglycol)poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (NHS-PEG-PLGA) to produce the Bor-NP. In a conclusion, our project focused on producing nanoparticles to get through the BBB and establishing an effective bio-manufacturing system to produce this kind of nanoparticle to lower the cost and achieve better therapeutic effect.
https://teams.igem.org/4232	Manufacturing	The production of chemical products by synthetic biology has become more and more advantageous than traditional chemical synthesis. Many enzymes used in biosynthsis need to be isolated from oxygen&#65292;while microbial respiration cannot produces energy without oxygen. At present, physical means are mainly used to infuse nitrogen to create a hypoxic environment, which cannot meet all application scenarios. Therefore, this year, BIT-China team was committed to creating an intracellular hypoxic environment at normal metabolic levels of microorganisms, using Escherichia coli to express functional elements for introducing synthesis modules to promote product efficiency. In addition, we also built an easy-to-use toolbox for BP neural network prediction to facilitate future practitioners to model.

Current biosecurity and prevention strategies (e.g. intravenous vaccination) are insufficient and logistical nightmares, resulting in deaths of millions of poultry worldwide. With Nanobuddy we propose a novel solution by engineering Lactobacillus reuteri, a native species in the lung and intestinal microbiome of chickens, to secrete broadly neutralizing nanobodies against bird flu. These nanobodies bind to a conserved region of the viruss hemagglutinin receptor, blocking it from entering cells. We researched several facets of our project: We investigated L. reuteris ability to secrete nanobodies and explored via lung-microbiomics L. reuteris presence in Dutch chickens. We explored the efficacy of the anti-avian influenza nanobodies and proposed an in-silico nanobody design workflow. Additionally, we developed a temperature sensitive biosafety module and performed extensive human practice to inform our final product. Nanobuddy, administered as a convenient spray, might revolutionize the fight against avian influenza.
https://teams.igem.org/4234	Foundational Advance	Treatment of glioma, which affects ~20,000 Americans annually, is limited by the lack of a scalable, physiologically relevant model for testing therapeutics. Duke iGEM is developing NODES, a high-throughput organoid-based drug screening platform to characterize treatment efficacy in the common IDH1/2-mutant glioma variant. Our platform measures cellular levels of D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2HG), an oncometabolite associated with pathway dysregulation, therapeutic resistance, and cancer progression. After identifying a D-2HG biosensor in Phase 1, we constructed a fluorescence-based reporter system in Phase 2. We validated the systems operational characteristics, including input-output dose response and D-2HG measurement accuracy. To explore the socioethical implications of our work, we extended our Phase 1 stakeholder analyses to review how sexual and racial representation in sample cell lines impact research. Through its physiologically relevant and dynamically measurable design, NODES has the potential to accurately characterize drug responses, offering new hope to glioma patients.
https://teams.igem.org/4235	Therapeutics	Protein S deficiency is a condition that leads to the formation of fatal blood-clots, contributing to widespread disorders including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, which kill ~900,000 Americans annually. Treatments for these disorders are limited to blood thinners with multiple side-effects. Our project, PROS, proposes the first injectable delivery of a recombinant human protein S therapy. Intravenously administered protein S can help treat protein S deficiency, and other disorders including TBI and severe COVID-19. In order to accomplish this, our team optimized PCR reactions, LIC reactions, and protein S expression in a prokaryotic system. We also streamlined the diagnostic procedure for protein S deficiency, establishing an algorithm which cuts the cost of testing by >40%. Overall, we were successful in creating an accessible and inclusive platform that can be further built upon to manufacture and deliver our PROS injectable as a therapeutic for protein S deficiency and related disorders.

Currently no sufficient treatment exists, especially in China, due to lack of effective and affordable drugs. This year, team iBowu-China learned about a plant-based substance, Astragalin, with the potential to be an effective cure. Astragalin is a natural flavonoid compound existing in medicinal plants. The traditional extraction doesn't lead to high enough product quantity and limited its large scale usage with economical availability. We study the bio-synthesis pathway of manufacturing Astragalin using engineered E. coli, expressing a series of plant-originated enzymes in the strains to generate Astragalin from a widely available substrate Naringenin. Experimentally we characterized the production of the enzymes, verified the production of Astragalin and attempted to optimize the production conditions for higher yields. We also conducted creative Education and Science Communication activities to raise social awareness of the Alzheimer's Disease and synthetic biology.

Our goal is to bring out an iGEM project from idea to industrialization, and finally change the world. After a thorough market and industry analysis, we noticed that the tide of biomanufacturing is just forming. Traditional development of a new synthetic biology product is time-consuming. However, to fit the fast-changing need of consumers, a fast R&D pipeline is required. To address this problem, we developed a CRISPR-based genetic manipulating toolkit for a fast-growing non-model organism, Vibrio natriegens. With these enabling technologies, we presented our first product, (-)-alpha-bisabolol, and achieved a yield significantly higher than E.coli. Beside (-)-alpha-bisabolol, a further business plan for food and cosmetics products is made and is coming true. ONCE iGEMers, more than an iGEM team. Together, we believe iGEMers ARE changing the world.
https://teams.igem.org/4238	Foundational Advance	Biosafety and security is the key to the new generation of synthetic biology. Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) have shown us much potential for solving global issues. Yet, the release of GMOs in the natural environment has been a huge safety concern, inhibiting the implementation into the wider society. Also, to encourage innovation, It is crucial to protect the intellectual property, in particular the gene sequence of GMOs, and GMOs themselves, from malicious interest and dual-use. This year, we present OPTOPASS, an optogenetic passcode system for microorganisms. In this system, S.cerevisiae produces the target substances only when exposed to the correct color of light in the correct order. However, when the light is applied in the wrong order or the culture is left under the sunlight, a kill switch is activated. Using our unique approach combining Light and Order, OPTOPASS proposes greater safety and security for the future of synthetic biology.
https://teams.igem.org/4239	Food & Nutrition	Food security is an immense challenge nowadays, particularly as crops are further endangered each year by new bacterial phytopathogens. The current tools to study pathogens are not efficient. Our project, FIAT LUX, based on an improved version of the luxCDABE operon ilux, aims at simplifying the use of luminescence as a reporter gene, notably for in vivo infection studies. It enables the tracking of luminescent bacterial spread in tissues, without having to sample or kill the host. Our team has focused the proof of concept on the soft rot disease in potatoes, caused by Dickeya. FIAT LUX is a promising tool to better understand this infection, helping to combat it and would contribute towards building more sustainable agricultural practices. After iGEM, we will extend the use of FIAT LUX to as many host-pathogen relationships as possible, and it may also be useful in the future to study beneficial symbiotic interactions.
https://teams.igem.org/4240	Software & AI	Usually, a complete metabolic pathway contains multiple nodes and multi-step reactions. Sometimes there is no readily suitable enzyme in the database for the catalysis of the reaction, which brings some difficulties to the study. Although some pathway design software, such as PathPred, can predict the entire metabolic pathway, it is still inevitable that intermediate reactions will be disconnected. Therefore, Modified Enzyme Interface (MEI) is designed to provide enzyme candidates to catalyze unknown reactions. With the premise of single step reaction, MEI screened out the potential enzymes by using a structure comparison algorithm. On this basis, users can select the enzyme for further modification, which is more likely to obtain efficient enzymes that can catalyze the target reaction. With MEI, we hope to help synthetic biologists shorten the experimental time and find the desired enzyme more quickly.
https://teams.igem.org/4241	Foundational Advance	Antimicrobial resistance is a global phenomenon arising from the indiscriminate use of antibiotics. To combat this problem, the Antimicrobial Peptide Cecropin B (CecB), a highly-effective, broad-spectrum antibiotic alternative is expressed in transgenic Chlorella autotrophica, a well-studied and highly-productive protein expressing microalgal chassis. It is expressed with a secretion signal peptide for extraction; and SUMO-tag for in-vitro cleavage using SUMO-protease. To validate efficacy, the isolated CecB is tested against common aquatic pathogens. The in-vitro cleavage system, barring the signal peptide, is also expressed using a bacterial chassis. This is to test the design and quantify the differences between microalgal and bacterial synthetic capabilities. To modify the system for industrial use, the signal peptide is removed and the SUMO-protease is additionally inserted, under a nitrogen-starvation inducible promoter, to cleave SUMO in-vivo and generate active AMPs. The microalgae are then freeze-dried, preserving active AMPs internally, which can then be used as supplemental feed.
https://teams.igem.org/4242	Therapeutics	In nature, microbes can exist as either planktonic or biofilm. Once pathogens biofilm is formed in human body, it will be rather hard to eradicate. The second messenger c-di-GMP is a positive regulator of biofilm formation, and c-di-GMP signaling is regarded as a potential target for the development of antipathogenic compounds. However, it has not been possible to monitor c-di-GMP levels in real time in many bacteria, which limits to effectively screen c-di-GMP-targeted antipathogenic compounds. To overcome this limitation, we will construct a c-di-GMP biosensor that is readily adaptable for gauging c-di-GMP levels in different bacteria. To demonstrate the application of the c-di-GMP biosensor, we will use it as a tool to screen agents that can induce Escherichia coli and Shewanella oneidensis biofilm dispersal by decreasing its c-di-GMP levels.

Currently employed screening methods, suffer from low detection rates and result in frequent false positives, leading to missed diagnoses or unnecessary follow-up treatments. We created Colourectal, an easy-to-use living diagnostic tool. We engineered the probiotic strain Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 to bind to tumour cells, detect two distinct cancer biomarkers, and secrete a coloured protein in the stool. We modelled and constructed a threshold-based circuit that detects the lactate biomarker, resulting in expression of a signal protein at significantly elevated lactate levels. The second biomarker, matrix metalloproteinase 9, activates the colour of our signal protein. Additionally, we have implemented biosafety circuits to limit viability of E. coli Nissle 1917 to the colon, by creating a dependence on temperature and mucin, and introduced an inducible kill-switch. Finally, we have modelled the potential persistence of our living diagnostic in the gut.

Our project uses padlock probes with rolling circle amplification to quantify microRNAs via fluorescence. Furthermore, we developed ProbeBuilder, a padlock probe generating software based on microRNA input, and Micro-Q, a portable fluorescent quantifier that allows for point-of-care screening for CAD. Current microRNA research in CAD is limited, which led us to offer CADlock as a tool for researchers to add miRNA characterization.

Lost nets are estimated to constitute at least 46% of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch and they can injure or kill around 650.000 animals each year. Therefore, a more environmentally friendly approach is urgent and paramount to ensure the stability of the industry and the environment it affects. By using spider silk, which has strength and flexibility comparable to nylon, and combining it with mussel foot protein, we aim to create fibres that can be twinned into biodegradable fishing nets.

https://teams.igem.org/4248	High School	This research aims to find an alternative solution to bacterial inhibition. Currently, antibiotics are popular choices due to their effectiveness against microorganism infection, while their abuse leads to bacterial resistance issues thus posing a huge threat to global health. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are alkaline polypeptides that can inhibit bacterial activity without causing bacterial resistance. For this issue, we developed five types of AMPs based on the following functional genes: Hydramacin-1, Spheniscin-2, Sparamosin26-54, LL-37, and fusion. The target gene was integrated into plasmid pET28a(+), expressing AMPs in E.coli BL21(DE3) competent cells. Besides the development of bacterial inhibition functions, the fusion AMP has antifungal abilities. Because the aquariums regularly replace a lot of water, we hope that the AMPs created can shed light on a more convenient method of fish tank cleaning to save water resources. Key Words: AMPs, gene

https://teams.igem.org/4257	Manufacturing	Low oxidation state phosphite, the dominant form of phosphorus on terrestrial planets, posed a formidable challenge on future interstellar migration. Involved in every aspect of life, phosphate rather phosphite is indispensable in the progress of human civilization. Thus, manufacture phosphate form phosphite is key to future success. Herein, by coupling phosphite dehydrogenase (PD) and polyphosphate kinase (PPK), we proposed a strategy that can spur E. coli to continuously produce phosphate from phosphite. In our engineered metabolic pathway, polyphosphate that derived from intracellular ATP is the crucial intermediate. Given that one phosphoric acid radical of ATP is deprived by PPK for polyphosphate synthesis, regeneration of ATP necessitated the oxidation of more phosphite by PD, thus achieving a high phosphate yield. In addition, to achieve the production trial in the context of terrestrial planets, we developed solar-energy driven algae processing hardware aiming at providing oxygen and nutrients for the engineered chassis.

Many bacteria already produce natural pigments in a wide variety of colors that could be used in the dyeing process. We combined a naturally occurring pigment with a cellulose binding domain to allow for increased pigment retention in cotton fabrics. This process included creating multiple constructs to find optimal protein orientation.

Our team developed a microbial factory to produce these nanoparticles by overexpressing the genes napA, copA, cueO, and melA in Escherichia coli BL21. These strains supernatants were used to reduce silver and gold ions and form bimetallic nanoparticles. The nanoparticles were analyzed using spectrophotometry and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). We employed a statistical model called Box-Behnken Design to optimize absorbance at 800 nm. The produced nanoparticles had an urchin-like shape and diameter of 50-100 nm, which is ideal for PTT, and were able to convert 800 nm light from a laser into heat.

First, contributing to quality regulations with an electrochemical biosensor capable of quantifying the amount of EDCs in crop irrigation water, comprised by Human Estrogen Receptor Alpha protein for a biological recognition, gold nanoparticles and a piezoelectric for signal transduction to be shown on the developed software. Then, solving the problem with our degradation system consisting of various types of immobilized recombinant laccases encased by zeolite, which oxidize EDCs and degrade them into less toxic photosensitive compounds. Our third project addresses the antibiotic resistance concern due to their use as selection markers. Isoeugenol monooxygenase as an alternative selection marker for Escherichia coli strains was proposed, implementing isoeugenol as an inhibitory growth substance.
https://teams.igem.org/4261	High School	Schistosomiasis cases number over 200 million annually, with another 700 million living in endemic areas. The disease persists despite 40 years of available treatments because current methods are reactionary, inaccessible to affected communities, and slowly becoming ineffective. SchistoGONE introduces a novel, environmental approach to permanently ending schistosomiasis by exploiting the sporocyst stage of schistosoma residing in biomphalaria glabrata. SchistsoGONE starts with the biosynthesis of plant-based, anti-schistosomal compound sanguinarine using a 7 plasmid e.coli and W303 s.cerevisiae combinationan optimized biosynthesis pathway and insurance that environmental containment breach releases only benign substrates. Modified microorganisms are contained in specially designed plates situated by bodies of water that allow easy access for biomphalaria glabrata snails, naturally attracted to yeast. The resultant consumption of sanguinarine by the sole intermediary host of schistosoma eradicates residing sporocysts. SchistoGONE can save the lives of nearly a billion and improve countless more by eradicating schistosomiasis at its source.
https://teams.igem.org/4262	Village	Lymantria dispar dispar, commonly known as spongy moths, is a species of moth of Eurasian descent. They are an invasive species in the United States, harming forests and local farms in the midwest and mostly the northeast by defoliating the trees they inhabit. S. cerevisiae, or brewers yeast, were genetically modified to produce the spongy moth pheromone Disparlure, cis-7,8-Epoxy-2-methyloctadecane, through a reductase and desaturase found in the spongy moth genome. A yeast strain that produces this pheromone could be used as a component of an improved spongy moth trap, which we call M.O.T.H.Y (Moth outsmarting through helpful yeast). This could benefit the conservation of local forests and farms, and the general research methodology could be applied to more pheromone-producing invasive species across the globe.

However, after being stained with sweat or exposed to direct sunlight, it may turn fragile and dull. During the dying process, lots of energy is consumed and many pollutants are produced, which is extremely harmful to the environment. As a result, our team produce special dyes, lycopene and patchoulol, with synthetic biology, which providing the silk with colors and antibacterial properties. These two terpenoids can be produce in vivo using pichia pastoris. We do promoter screening to select the best modified promoter and do epPCR to mutate the key enzyme PTS to improve its efficiency. We also build up an optogenetic system to achieve an elaborate regulation on the production of lycopene and patchoulol. Besides, a quick and accurate visualization method is presented to screen out the target strains.

https://teams.igem.org/4265	Software & AI	The arms race between prokaryotes and viruses drives the evolution of various defense systems, like CRSIPR-Cas system and RM system, the genes of which account for a large proportion of the genome. Studies show that these defense genes tend to cluster, forming the so-called defense islands. Inside the defense island exist many currently unknown genes which might turn up to be novel defense genes However, the huge amount of data and skills of multiple bioinformatic tools required can be quite unfriendly to researchers new to the fields, and the rapidly progress made in the fields makes it hard for the existing databases to catch up. Therefore, our project LOUPE focuses mainly on the discovery of the currently unknown defense genes in prokaryotes by exploiting the idea of defense islands. It consists of an online database coupled with a local prediction and evaluation platform of defense genes with optimized protocol.

Due to limited lab access during the pandemic, it has been challenging to maintain live cells that require operations around the clock. Sogang_Korea aims to build SynBioBot, a robotic system capable of remote and automated cell culture processes as well as synthetic biology experiments. A 6-axis robotic arm was used to perform autonomous cell culture work, which included cell seeding, media transfer, incubator storage, and cell passage. Along with system programming for precise equipment positioning and control, we designed the mechanical interfaces, allowing the robot arm to use various lab tools (e.g., pipettes) designed for human hands without modification. SynBioBot has further carried out genetic modification protocols like lentiviral transduction in mammalian cells.

https://teams.igem.org/4268	Foundational Advance	Cyanobacteria are fast-emerging as effective chassis for the sustainable synthesis of organic compounds. They are currently being used to produce plastics, proteins, biofuels, and more. Cyanophages are cyanobacteria-infecting viruses that regulate cyanobacterial populations in nature. This makes them a promising vehicle for cyanobacterial engineering. To aid scientists and iGEM teams who work with cyanobacteria, this project aims to create a cyanophage toolkit for their use. Our project will create a ghost phage that can recognize and bind marine cyanobacteria. A minimal set of cyanophage genes will be assembled into a phagemid vector that can replicate in E. coli and produce the structural proteins of the phage. To allow our phage to be utilized to immobilize modified cyanobacteria, a biotin-tagged variant of the capsid will be created. Further development of the phage toolkit will enable it to be used as a DNA delivery vehicle in cyanobacterial engineering.
https://teams.igem.org/4269	Environment	Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is a common water contaminant. Detection of this chemical requires liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry, which is not easily accessible due to the high cost and extensive training needed. Therefore, efforts to develop a more accessible detection method are crucial. The UChicago iGEM 2022 team has begun developing a bacterial biosensor using a T7 polymerase to amplify a fluorescent signal upon PFOA detection. A promoter found in bacterial species Rhodococcus jostii, known as prmA, responds to the presence of PFOA in the environment. Previous work by USAFA iGEM 2019 showed that driving red fluorescent protein expression using only prmA yielded low RFP expression. Therefore, our designed system uses prmA to drive expression of a T7 polymerase. By placing a T7 promoter upstream of a green fluorescent protein gene, our design aims to amplify GFP to visible levels, allowing for easy, inexpensive water testing in the field.
https://teams.igem.org/4270	High School	Patchoulol is one of the main active components of Pogostemon cablin, which is often used to defend against phytopathogenic microbes and combat human diseases. Patchoulol can be obtained by natural extraction, chemical synthesis, and synthetic biology engineering. However, the natural extraction is often low-efficiency, and the chemical synthesis is often costly and inefficient, and may not yield enantiomerically pure patchoulol. We engineered high level patchoulol production in yeast by overexpression of farnesyl diphosphate synthase(FPS, ERG20) and patchoulol synthase (PTS) either driven by strong promoter or light-induced promoter HIGH CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE173 (HCF173). The strategy increased the synthesis of patchoulol, which may also provide the foundations to generat higher levels of other terpenes for research, industrial production or therapeutic applications.
https://teams.igem.org/4271	High School	In various water bodies, the overabundance of nutrients from agricultural chemicals, including fertilizers and biocides, resulted in the process of eutrophication. The increase of phosphate and nitrogen amounts leads to algal bloom followed by the decline in sustainability of lives in the water bodies. The physical and chemical solutions that currently exist are limited to certain conditions and could potentially disturb the ecosystem. Our project presents a new method to solve the issue of eutrophication from its roots. By engineering bacteria that overexpress organophosphorus hydrolase (OPH) and antisense PhoU mRNA (AsPhoU), we can hydrolyze organic phosphates into inorganic phosphate (Pi) for detoxification, enhance the efficacy of Pi transport, and fix the excess of Pi into polyphosphate (polyP), respectively. The implementation of a filtering device containing the engineered bacteria with biosensors for the detection of polyphosphate accumulation could reduce phosphate levels in water bodies to ultimately prevent the cycle of eutrophication.

Mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) are natural products produced by various marine organisms such as cyanobacteria and algae, able to absorb UV radiation. However, the low rate of MAA production limits the potential of commercializing MAAs as sunscreen ingredient. This year, LINKS_China engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae to produce three MAAsshinorine, porphyra-334 and palythineand another UV-absorbing molecule, gadusol. We incorporated enzymes from Nostoc punctiforme, Nostoc linckia and Actinosynnema mirum to structure the optimal pathway, and introduced the xylose metabolism pathway to increase yield. These yeast products has successfully absorbed UV radiation, covering most UVA and UVB rays. For skin repairing, we introduced superoxide dismutase and catalase to remove reactive oxidative species produced in the skin.

In nature, 2-PE is mainly extracted from rose, jasmine, tomato, and buckwheat plants. However, the concentration of 2-PE in plants is deficient and susceptible to natural factors, such as weather and plant diseases, resulting in the cost of extracting 2-PE up to 3500-6000 USD/kg. Cheap 2-PE can be prepared by chemical synthesis, but the process of producing benzene ethanol by chemical synthesis is complicated. Therefore, we constructed an engineered strain utilizing synthetic biology, so that it can synthesize natural, green, and sustainable 2-PE to meet the needs of the food and cosmetics industry.

To help relieve depression, our team developed a probiotic to regulate depression, based on the gut-brain axis. Since it has been previously proven that 5-HTP can increase the concentration of serotine in the brain to improve mood, and GABA can block certain nerve cells to inhibit anxiety and stress, we overexpressed the TPH1 gene into E.coli Nissle 1917(EcN) to catalyze the production of tryptophan which consequently catalyzes the biopterin-dependent monooxygenation of tryptophan to 5-HTP. Meanwhile, we overexpressed the GadB gene in EcN to convert the glutamate to GABA using pyridoxal phosphate (the active form of vitamin B6) as a cofactor. To prevent genetically modified contamination, our team developed a suicide system for the strain. This probiotic has the potential to establish a more peaceful society with higher productivity.

https://teams.igem.org/4303	Foundational Advance	The 5' untranslated regions of the mRNA upstream of the coding sequence are retained post-mRNA splicing and can form secondary structures that can further form stem-loops, pseudoknots, and other motifs, which can influence translation, transcription, frequency of translation initiation, elongation speed, mRNA half-life and folding of nascent proteins. In the iGEM Part Registry, we have the BioBrick constructs of promoters, ribosome binding sites, protein-coding sequences, terminators, but not the 5'UTR. We are attempting to optimize the 5UTR sequences and make them available as a BioBrick sequence to enhance the translation initiation further. We are using E. coli as a chassis with marker proteins and correlating their expression with OSTIR predictions, structural predictions of NUPACK and a neural network to construct a set of UTR sequences which would be tested in the wet lab. Finally, these sequences could be used further understand gene expression and potentially fine tune biotechnology processes.
https://teams.igem.org/4304	High School	Helicobacter pylori is an anaerobic helicobacter parasitic in the human stomach, which was first isolated from the body of gastric ulcer patients by Marshall. It has been listed as a clear carcinogen. The detection of Helicobacter pylori has become an important physical examination item for the prevention of gastric cancer. The design idea of this project is to construct Helicobacter pylori 16s and cagA sequence vectors and transfer them into Escherichia coli to simulate Helicobacter pylori. Then, by constructing Cas12a and sgRNA vectors, isothermal amplification technology is used to identify the simulated Escherichia coli. This project will build a fast and convenient detection method for Helicobacter pylori, Shigella, and Salmonella based on CRISPR, help people to detect Helicobacter pylori, Shigella, and Salmonella conveniently and efficiently, and contribute to the prevention of gastric cancer. Key Words: Helicobacter pylori, CRISPR, gastric cancer
https://teams.igem.org/4305	High School	Due to the rapid pace of data production, the demand for data storage is increasing. Considering the limitations of current mediums, an alternative method for data storage has been proposed: storing data in DNA which is more cost and space efficient. Binary data is encoded into nucleotide bases. However, DNA, when exposed to stress factors deforms, leading to lost or altered data in DNA; thus, methods to ensure the stability of DNA are critical to implementing DNA data storage. We hypothesized that forming Transcription Factor A Mitochondria (TFAM)-DNA complex in an aqueous solution supports DNA stability during data storage and retrieval. TFAM preserves DNA inside the mitochondria, acting as an adequate stabilizer. The TFAM-DNA complex was created with replicated human lung cDNA and purified TFAM protein. This complex was able to maintain stability in conditions with various stress factors, suggesting that DNA can be a viable method to store data.

https://teams.igem.org/4307	WIKI	Reproductive health has become a hotspot of concern since recent years have witnessed a continuous decline in fertility rates in China. Among all physiological factors, low sperm quality is considered as the major cause. Currently, sperm quality can be examined through hospital appointments&#65292;which are time-consuming and may place psychological burden on patients, adding additional challenge to tackling the issue of reproductive health. Therefore, our team has proposed a novel diagnostic method to test sperm quality for household use. Our chip-based product is designed to measure sperm motility and fertility simultaneously, and present results in a visual way. We believe our home-use sperm quality test chip could contribute to self-examination and large-scale preliminary disease screening of sperm quality, increasing the medical attendance rate of reproductive diseases. Perhaps the hardest part of solving reproductive health dilemma is to confront it directly. We hope our product will be the first step.

We used bioinformatics to screen out a lncRNA molecule that is highly correlated with the occurrence and development of more than 20 kinds of cancers and then designed a point-of-care matching detection platform system for it. The platform system is easy to operate and does not require expensive instruments to quantitatively detect the expression of lncRNA in human blood. It provides a very meaningful indicator for predicting the risk of cancer.
https://teams.igem.org/4309	Environment	Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a class of semi-volatile organic compound that is abundant in the environment. Ligninolytic enzymes such as laccases and lignin peroxidases are potential biological pathways for bioremediation of PAHs. However, there are few studies on the heterologous expression of ligninolytic enzymes in Escherichia coli to degrade PAHs. The present study investigated the oxidation of PAHs using laccase CotA from Bacillus subtilis and lignin peroxidase LipH8 from Phanerochaete chrysosporium. It was observed that recombinant CotA and LipH8 had significant oxidation effects on PAHs. Moreover, combined ligninolytic enzymes are a better candidate for the remediation of PAHs than a single ligninolytic enzyme. An arabinose-regulated suicide switch was built to induce suicide once the engineered bacteria were released from the environment for biosafety. Our work will allow the design of biocatalysts for ligninolytic enzyme engineering and provide new insight into the remediation of PAHs by combined ligninolytic enzymes.
https://teams.igem.org/4310	Environment	Our project develops an intrinsic biosensor to detect the leakage of genetically modified microalgae from wastewater treatment process. The manipulated microalgae is assumed to be co-cultured with microbes due to many benefits. Once the purified water is released to the outer environment, the signal communication from microbes to microalgae through quorum sensing will be disconnected. The microalgae perceive this disconnection and can inform this by its fluorescence. This project will enable the application of gene modification into wastewater treatment by guaranteeing biosafety. In addition, focusing on co-culture, we made a bioreactor to purify wastewater and collect microalgae pellets for extraction of biomass, which will provide the net cost reduction of wastewater treatment.

These bacteria block water uptake from the plants xylem, causing the plant to die. Chemical pesticides are currently used, but there are detrimental effects to the environment and consumers. We aim to contribute to SDGs 15th goal of life on land by decreasing the usage of pesticides by providing a substitute: Modified Bombolitin Antimicrobial Peptide. The modified bombolitin peptide, with attached amino acids to increase hydrophobicity, is expressed through competent Escherichia coli cells. Gene cloning and overexpression of bombolitin was done. To test the efficiency of plant protection, in-vitro testing of the peptide on Ralstonia bacteria is applied. Additionally, peptides with similar properties to the bombolitin are also identified through biopanning, allowing for future improvements. By expressing modified bombolitin, we wish to find a possible alternative to certain pesticides.

The project transforms a green microalgae in order to create a new food source, rich in iron to fight malnutrition problems like anemia. Biologically, our project consists of overexpressing THB1 in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. This protein binds to iron molecules and increases the irons bioavailability. To control and improve THB1 expression, our team worked on the development of insulator sequences compatible with the MoClo kit, the cloning tool we used for Chlamydomonas. These sequences isolate genes from their genomic context. Our THB1 transgene therefore includes an inducible promoter, the gypsy insulator sequence from Drosophila as well as the associated protein Su(Hw) essential to the insulator mechanism. Finally, the production of the GMO uses bioreactors as an alternative to polluting and soil-destroying methods of agriculture.
https://teams.igem.org/4317	High School	Oil spills have always been one of mankinds most environmentally damaging acts since the 19th century. However, traditional biodegradable oil absorbents are hardly ideal due to their low cost-efficiency and poor oil adsorption capacity. One promising alternative material is brown rot fungi-decomposed pine trees, which has extremely high hydrophobicity and oleophilicity due to its high lignin content. However, the decomposition process takes up to 10 years in nature, making the mass production of the material impractical. To tackle this problem, we used E. Coli and Bacillus Subtilis to mass produce 4 types of cellulose-degrading enzymes. Treating pine tree powder with these genetically modified organisms secreting enzymes of interest resulted in an increase of lignin content from 25~30% to 39~47% while also showing significant improvement in oil adsorption. Our novel approach speeded up the decomposition process to 12 weeks, providing the potential for mass production of promising alternative oil absorbent material.
https://teams.igem.org/4318	Software & AI	The single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology provides a powerful tool for dissecting heterogenous tumor tissue at single cell resolution. However, it still remains challenging to reconstruct cell differentiation dynamics on the expression spectrum. Here, we develop a new method combining lineage clustering and generalized additive model (GAM). Validating this method on hematopoietic cell lineage and real hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) samples, we find our method have a greater potential to build differentiation pseudotime with a higher resolution. We also find that enrichment of specific lineage and differential expression patterns are associated with worse clinical outcomes. Combining theses together, we believe our method could provide better a tool for studying heterogenous biopsies such as tumor.

https://teams.igem.org/4320	Therapeutics	Oral mucositis (OM) is a common complication of cancer therapies characterized by the breakdown of epithelial cells in the oral cavity, resulting in inflammation-promoting reactive oxygen species (ROS) and DNA damage. This leads to the death of surrounding oral epithelial cells, which leaves the mucosal tissue susceptible to infection and ulceration. Current therapeutics focus on improving oral hygiene and treating pain. However, GSHield aims to reduce surrounding non-cancerous cell death and provide a protective barrier between the oral cavity and irritants. We aim to produce a bacterial cellulose patch functionalized with yeast engineered to increase extracellular production of glutathione, an antioxidant that quenches ROS. ADP1 and GSH1, which are involved in export and synthesis will be overexpressed, while genes encoding for degradation will be knocked out. Our system will be able to sense and respond to environmental signals using the CCP1 promoter, which is responsive to oxidative stress.
https://teams.igem.org/4321	Food & Nutrition	In 2020, Canada produced over 679,000 tonnes of greenhouse produce, with a farmgate value of 1.8 billion CAD. In Ontario, Leamington alone is home to more greenhouse acreage than the entire United States. However, many factors influence yield of these crops, and growers can experience massive yield losses due to insect damage. To meet the demand for innovative strategies to control insect pests, we engineered Bacillus subtilis to inducibly express insect Cytotoxic (Cyt) proteins through an IPTG responsive promoter, Pgrac. When off, the modified B. subtilis behaves normally and may have a positive effect on plant growth. When on, the bacterial biofilm produces Cyt proteins, creating a pesticide barrier to any Dipteran insect larvae that may be present in the soil. This powerful bioinsecticide designed by iGEM Guelph will place a new tool in the hands of growers to combat harmful greenhouse insect pathogens.

This was inspired by the need for synthetic biology to reach the public in an accessible and aesthetic way. MicroMurals provides an avenue to initiate discussions about synthetic biology with those at all levels of expertise, interest, and familiarity. Our team implemented an inducible hydrogel bio-ink system with biofilm-forming curli fibers fused to the chromoproteins aeBlue, asPink, and amajLime to create microbial paints. Hydrogels were harvested from E. coli and can be functionalized using VOC-uptaking cyclodextrin nanofibers or carbon-fixing microbes. We built a 3D bioprinter to print these hydrogels, as well as a handheld bioprinter for greater accessibility. Computer modeling was conducted for protein expression, protein folding, bioprinter extrusion, and bioreactor cell growth. Educational outreach events were held for multiple age groups, and BioArt exhibits were hosted on our campus to engage undergraduate students.
https://teams.igem.org/4323	Environment	This year the Prairie iGEM team, hosted here at the University of Manitoba, aims to develop a novel solution to control the invasive populations of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha). The invasive zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) pose threats to many water bodies in North America and create a burden for local communities. Zebra mussels can clog up a pipeline supplying water to communities, damage infrastructure, and disrupt ecosystems. We aim to build a proof-of-concept for a smart bio-based device that can lay dormant and express molluscicide to specifically target zebra mussels. Our project is comprised of two parts. Firstly, we explored the iGEM registry for methods to sense zebra. Secondly, we optimize the expression and secretion of certain molluscicides in our model chassis. Finally, we combined the two parts to get a final bio-based device that can express and secrete molluscicide only in the presence of zebra mussels.
https://teams.igem.org/4324	Asia	A large amount of bio-waste is burnt or deposited in landfill, releasing harmful greenhouse gases. Much of agricultural bio-waste contains plant dry matter, or lignocellulose, approximately half of which is glucose and 18-30% is xylose. Synthetic biologists can engineer E. coli to grow on lignocellulosic biomass and produce clean bio-energy. However, carbon catabolite repression and diauxic growth controls the order in which different carbon sources are metabolised, and so E. coli preferentially utilises glucose over xylose, meaning xylose content in lignocellulose is not utilised to its full potential. We have increased the xylose uptake of E. coli by inducing a yeast-derived XR-XDH pathway in E. coli to provide an alternative route for catabolising xylose to xylulose-5-phosphate (X5P). We also induced phosphoketolase to alleviate the flux of X5P through glycolysis. We envision our improved E. coli strain to serve as a chassis organism that optimises the efficiency of sustainable bio-energy production.

To improve the production of acarbose, our project intends to develop a generalized modeling software, by adding constraints to the genome-wide metabolic model of actinomycetes and combining deep learning to predict model parameters, it provides a feasible solution for the reconstruction of Deep Learning-based Enzyme-Constrained Genome-scale Metabolic model (DL-ecGEM) for actinomycetes. The model can also be used for simulation experiments. Through that, some hotspot identification tools can be used to find directional transformation plans for cells. Combined with the transformation recommendations given by the software, the deep learning network will be updated and can re-predict the parameters in the model. Thus, the phenotypic changes in acarbose production can be observed through simulation. At the same time, the model parameters can be optimized based on experimental data to make the model more accurate.
https://teams.igem.org/4329	Village	Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) threats the food safety especially for home storage. The enterotoxins can be generated by S. aureus quorum sensing (QS) system related to several genes named accessory gene regulator (Agr). Only AgrC and AgrB encode channel proteins which can react with autoinducing peptide (AIP). To block the QS channels, we utilized protein proximity labeling technology by fusing TurboID with N-AgrD and AIP. The fused proteins will bring TurboID to the quorum sensing channels AGRC and AGRB which will further be blocked by protein biotinylation on multiple lysine residues. The automatic biotinylation happens when the engineered Escherichia coli itself can produce more biotin through its own metabolic pathways. We therefore increased the expression of dethiobiotin synthetase and biotin synthase and, at the same time, knock-out of biotin consumption gene named bifunctional ligase/repressor BirA by CRISPR-Cas9. Thus, purified TurboID-AIP can be used for protecting food and our health.

We believe that Chitosan oligosaccharide can do something valuable. After reading some articles, we decided to investigate the topic about converting into chitosan oligosaccharide since chitosan is insoluble in water, but chitosan oligosaccharide is soluble in water, and it maintain the value that chitosan brings. Shells will be converted into chitosan oligosaccharide. Our experiment will mainly focus on the last part of the progress. We use cell surface display to make our experiment result better. The work which changes chitosan to chitosan oligosaccharide works more efficient when it takes place on the cells surface. Chitosan oligosaccharide has a lot of values which is good for either human or animals and even plants. It can antioxidant, anti-tumor, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, make animal bones stronger and help the growth of roots.

The excessive consumption of alcohol can cause damage to health, and coupled with the fact that companies do not provide them with certain safety measures, the health of these people is not guaranteed. Escherichia Nissle 1917 (EcN) has been widely demonstrated to be a safe oral probiotic. In this study, we genetically modified EcN expressing the ethanol dehydrogenase gene, acetaldehyde dehydrogenase gene, NAD synthase gene, and NADH oxidase gene. By expressing the NAD synthase and NADH oxidase genes, the efficiency of ethanol dehydrogenase and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase was increased, and thus the rate of alcohol decomposition was increased. Finally, we constructed an intestinal probiotic with high efficiency in alcohol catabolism to help alcoholic beverage workers to protect their health.

https://teams.igem.org/4334	High School	In recent years, breast cancer has seen a surge in cases globally and is the second leading cause of cancer deaths among women. Current screening methods, including mammograms and MRIs, can be uncomfortable and costly, discouraging many women from regular screening. However, early detection can greatly increase survival rates, calling for the need for a better screening method. We thus propose a convenient and minimally-invasive testing kit for breast cancer. Our initial research revealed that Mucin 1 is overexpressed in patients, so we initially planned to detect its concentrations through a lateral flow assay (LFA). However, we switched to Aptamer FRET this year upon learning that LFAs are less accurate than expected. Due to a higher range of error than expected and a risk of false positives, we concluded that this method is best used to detect other diseases where any concentration of biomarker indicates that a patient requires treatment.

We tried out 7 different pressure conditions to culture C. reinhardtii, and detect their lipid production, growth path and differential gene expression to locate target genes that can be knocked out to form a mutant bank. We construct CRISPR off-target model and Genome-scale Metabolic models to stimulate and direct experiment designs.

The aim of project is to create a multi-functional dressing using the microneedle system (MN) and synthetic peptides composed by antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) to achieve rapid and effective detection and sterilization of S. aureus. Additionally, AMP can reduce the possibility of multi-drug resistance. For specificity, linker cleaved by V8 protease turn the antimicrobial peptide complex (AMPC) into AMPs. The MN is made of hyaluronic acid methacrylate (HAMA) and gelatin as the specific triggered coating and drug carrier, respectively.

In collaboration with Alianza Cacao, our team is developing a cadmium detection system to provide on-site detection of areas with high amounts of cadmium in the soil. We are also working on developing a plasmid construct with a MerR protein that blocks the promoter region of the RFP gene. This MerR protein can be inhibited in the presence of cadmium, allowing the amount of cadmium in the soil to be relatively determined by the amount of RFP protein produced. Once high levels of cadmium are detected in the soil, the next step will be using hyperaccumulating plants along with modified rhizobacteria to bioremediate cadmium in the soil.

While hydroponics can be used to increase food supply, the yield of such a system is relatively low. One of the reasons is that the nutrition solution needs to be discarded regularly, to prevent pH changes. Here, we engineered E. coli to include a genetic pH Shooting (GPS) system which can neutralize the solution from time to time. To further increase the yield, we also created the hormone binding systems (HBDs), as some plant hormones like abscisic acid (ABA) are known to slow down plant growth. We here engineered E. coli to produce hormone binding proteins, T2R4 and PYL8, to inhibit ABA. By using HBD and GPS, we hope to establish a sustainable hydroponic agriculture system in the near future.

Our solution is to use an engineered phage therapy that directly targets the infectant, after detection with a phage reporter assay. Phages are advantageous because they are bacteria specific, a phage can be used to target a specific bacteria. Once a blood sample is obtained, our library of engineered phage will carry a fluorescent gene that will result in fluorescent bacteria once the phage inserts in its DNA. Phage types that lead to fluorescence will be administered to the patient in the phage therapy step. Additionally, interactive exhibits were held at local museums to engage the community on synthetic biology and how it could be used to address sepsis.

ARROWE specifically focuses on detecting eDNA from Pseudogymnoascus destructans, a fungus that causes White Nose Syndrome in bats. This system works via homologous recombination, which occurs when P. destructans eDNA is detected, producing a fluorescent signal and yielding resistance to azidothymidine. We also constructed and tested ADP1 strains engineered to detect the nptII and blaTEM-1 antibiotic resistance genes to demonstrate other applications of our approach and characterize parameters affecting DNA detection. We hope ARROWE will draw attention to ADP1s potential and serve as a model for future ADP1-centric projects.

Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) are essential omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, which have irreplaceable effects on human health. Therefore, if eggs are rich in DHA and EPA, they can be incorporated into the daily diet of humans. Currently, only DHA eggs are available on the market, and it is obtained by feeding flaxseed into the feed of laying hens, which has the disadvantage of low content and high cost. Here, we hope to construct an engineered Yarrowia lipolytica strain that can produce DHA and EPA. In addition, the ratio of DHA/EPA in eggs can be changed to meet the needs of various groups of people, so as to achieve low-cost input and efficient output.

We tackled this problem by delivering siRNAs packed in liposomes via the nose-to-brain route. Our team has designed a therapeutic platform where siRNA against a specific viral encephalitis can be produced easily in E.coli and packed into the corresponding optimal formulation of liposomes. This optimal formulation is obtained with our microfluidics liposome generator in the future. Therefore, not only can we circumvent the blood brain barrier and transport therapeutics more effectively to the brain, but we also have created a platform technology to develop therapeutics against many different types of viral encephalitis. As it is one of the deadliest types of brain inflammation, and moreover no vaccine exists against it, we designed our siRNAs to work against the herpes simplex encephalitis.

However, screening and therapy still require invasive methods and lack specificity. Biosensors have been developed before but the tunability is mostly low, despite being fundamental for a broad application. The safety of biosensors also remains a hurdle to entering the clinics. Therefore, our goal is to develop a dose-dependent biosensor using NarX-NarL two-component nitrate sensing system and a naringenin responsive promotor in E. coli as a proof-of-concept. Temperature-sensitive riboswitches and a type II toxin-antitoxin system are used to establish biocontainment. To support and guide biosensor development, modeling is done to predict the threshold needed. The final goal is to combine these two genetic circuits in Lactobacillus spp., which is part of the gut microbiome, and to replace fluorescence with drug allowing therapy with fewer side effects.

In British Columbia, 40 million acres of forest have been recently ravaged, leading to a huge economic impact. This infestation is migrating to the east, which increasingly hurts more forests in Canada as well as affecting biodiversity. Our goal is to biologically produce (-)-trans-verbenol (the mating pheromone of the MPB) in an engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain. This allows for an exclusively acellular delivery of the pheromone in the environment, making our solution safe and respectful towards bioethical standards. Ultimately, one could produce, extract and purify the pheromone for use in monitoring and prevention. Our project adds to the limited tool set used against MPB and is a versatile tool for the synthesis of other insect pheromones. This could represent a huge step forward in the fight against ravaging species.

After meeting with representatives from the Queens Office of Indigenous Initiatives and the Chief of Tyendinaga, we learned that there isnt a reliable drinking water diagnostic that could be used by communities. LAMPogen aims to develop a point of care water pathogen detection and filtration device. We used an emerging nucleic acid amplification technique called Loop Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) to detect conserved 16s rRNA regions within pathogenic E. coli, Salmonella, Shigella and Campylobacter. We have optimized the reaction through the re-engineering the polymerase responsible for LAMP via mutagenesis and protien fusion.

Currently, there are limited approaches to preventing CVD caused by high cholesterol. To address this, we designed and validated a novel three-step metabolic pathway to metabolize cholesterol into coprostanol, a sterol that cannot be absorbed in the gut. We subsequently integrated this pathway in B. subtilis, to engineer a cholesterol-lowering probiotic able to prevent intestinal cholesterol absorption. The pathway consists of ismA, a hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase from the bacterium, E. coprostanoligenes, and two repurposed sterol-metabolizing enzymes from humans. We tested the functionality of this pathway through in vitro enzymatic assays and confirmed coprostanol formation. Altogether, we engineered and validated the necessary components for a cholesterol to coprostanol-converting B. subtilis probiotic bacterium as a novel cholesterol lowering probiotic aimed at preventing CVD.

According to the World Health Organization, the world has about 1,5 billion infected people. These neglected diseases severely affect children and adolescents from vulnerable social groups in Brazil. The current strategy to control infections is administering anthelmintic drugs to at-risk populations, especially school-age children. Although this recommendation efficiently reduces cases, it can lead to increased resistance of parasites to current therapeutic options. Additionally, the diseases leave behind intestinal damage that can intensify malnutrition scenarios. So, we propose a new treatment: ProChi, which consists of genetically engineered Lactobacillus acidophilus that produces and secretes chitinase, an enzyme that cleaves chitin - a polysaccharide in the cuticles and eggs of nematodes. Therefore, it can kill these parasites and promote a quicker reconstitution of the intestinal tissue, contributing to the re-establishment of the nutritional absorption compromised by the disease.

PCC 6803 with a cyclical bioluminescent pathway elucidated from fungi, which has previously only been expressed in eukaryotes. Our genetic circuit was designed based on the analysis of genomic differences and field observations of different species of luminous fungi. With these fungal genes we will create a scalable, versatile, and carbon-negative lighting source. We engineered E. Coli with a codon optimized version of this pathway as a stepping-stone for expression and characterization of the system in Synechocystis. This proof-of-concept study will open the doors for an adaptable and efficient way of growing light.
https://teams.igem.org/4351	High School	Diabetes affects millions of people across the globe. Current treatments for Type I diabetes are routine insulin injections or islet cell transplants. Our proposed project, Dia-Beatable, utilizes self-amplifying messenger RNA (sa-mRNA) to produce insulin. The self-replicating nature will allow for fewer injections over longer periods of time. The proposed RNA construct would be self-regulating as we have incorporated an insulin-binding RNA aptamer as a control mechanism. This creates a negative feedback loop where the RNA aptamer acts a switch that terminates the translation process when insulin levels are high. Dia-Beatable also has potential uses in veterinary care and could be used to treat diabetes in pets as well. We hope that with our proposed treatment, patients and caregivers can minimize the strenuous maintenance process required when dealing with Type I diabetes.

https://teams.igem.org/4354	Environment	Our project aims to modify Bacillus subtilis by building a molecular switch in Bacillus subtilis which expresses a large number of nitrogen-related enzymes under blue light irradiation to control the total nitrogen content in water with synthetic biological way. We hope it can decompose nitrogen-containing organic matter and avoid eutrophication of water bodies. On the other hand ,we design the suicide mechanism under green light irradiation causing the death of the strain which could significantly reduce the cost of biosafety disposal. By monitoring and analysis of temperature, dissolved oxygen, nitrogen salt concentration and other indicators in the water body with biosensors and mathematical modeling, we hope to make a photo-regulated bacterium preparation that is green and environmentally friendly with less repeated addition, a strong sewage treatment effect and adjustment of its concentration in real time.

https://teams.igem.org/4357	Environment	With the continual release of vast amounts of carbon dioxide, the water on Earth, particularly saltwater, faces acidification. Fortunately, we found the magical inward H+ pump, the Xenorhodopsin, expressed on the membrane of some archaea in some literatures. In our project, a genetically engineered E. coli, the AcidOceanus, is planned to be constructed and applied to absorb H+ in the water body. Integrating the Xenorhodopsin gene, AcidOceanus produce Xenorhodopsin and constantly transport H+ from water into intracellular space under light conditions. Furthermore, as an approach to recycle H+, we are about to coordinate will some companies to design a device where E. coli release the H+ in dark condition. Our project is devoted to providing a feasible direction, for water acidification in a small range of areas and at the same time educating the public, especially teens, to realize its hazards to marine life and the urgency to resolve it.
https://teams.igem.org/4358	Therapeutics	An excessive blood sugar concentration in patients suffering from diabetes mellitus (DM) inhibits the healing of skin wounds. When it becomes severe, ordinary wounds can lead to amputations. This year, NCHU_Taichung aims to develop a wound repair-promoting dressing for DM patients with an intrinsic compound, pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ). To increase the yield of PQQ, a well-known probiotic was used, <i> Bacillus subtilis </i> natto, as our host and redesigned the PQQ plasmid shown in 2021 NCHU_Taichung. A xylose-dependent promoter was implemented to regulate the biosynthesis rate. The fermentation product using glucose-induced keratinocyte to evaluate the effect of PQQ. The results of wound healing assay in HaCaT cells indicated when supplement with PQQ can accelerate the cell migration within 24 hours observation compare with untreated group, which provide a concrete evidence to increase DM patients injury recovery and has its high-potential to become a commercial product in a low-cost.
https://teams.igem.org/4359	Therapeutics	Poor specificity is a fundamental issue with contemporary cancer drug therapy, necessitating improved alternatives. We have conceptualized and developed Duonco, a dual nanovesicle drug delivery system to address breast cancer, a growing concern in our community. Duonco targets HER2 and CX3CR1, two cell surface markers over-expressed in HER2+ breast cancer. We bioengineered E. coli to produce two distinct outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) populations, to selectively deliver chemotherapeutic prodrugs and their cognate enzymes, respectively, into tumour cells. This system is developed such that it functions analogous to an AND gate, where the drug is only activated in cells that overexpress both markers, and remains inactivated or undelivered in normal cells. Using hypervesiculating strains of E. coli, we have generated OMVs expressing anti-HER2 or anti-CX3CR1 affinity proteins on their surface and characterized them. We propose that such an adaptable system has immense potential for cell-specific targeting as well as in personalized medicine.

https://teams.igem.org/4361	Diagnostics	The occurrence of drink spiking with so-called rape drugs has been increasing over the past years, reaching new heights in the past year. Most cases involve the drug gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB). To protect people from drink spiking, we need a sensor that can detect GHB rapidly, continuously, in-situ, and accurately. With such a device, it will be possible to detect GHB in a spiked drink and alert users to prevent them from drinking it. We have designed a new kind of sensor for the detection of GHB in drinks by combining the specificity of biomolecules with the reliability of electronics. The sensor is integrated in a cup you can drink from, with a compartment in the bottom that holds the electrode and the electronic hardware. Our research involved the assembly of a working prototype from existing parts, as well as engineering new parts to improve the sensor.

The project of iGEM Tianjin2022 aims to explore more possibilities of DNA storage technology. Through reasonable and unique coding algorithm, we transformed the data to be stored, such as images, music and texts, into DNA sequences that satisfy the editing needs. And then our multiplex information editing system(Micro nuwa) which contains base editor and ultra -long gRNA arrays, rewrites the data pre-stored in DNA. Ultimately, We successfully transformed one image into another image and transformed one piece of music into another piece of music. Micro nuwa serves as a powerful tool efficiently modifying the information stored in DNA.

https://teams.igem.org/4364	Environment	Latest research shows increased levels of 14 commonly used antibiotics in rivers across 72 countries on six continents. This finding is supported by reports from Patancheru (India) that indicate levels of the antibiotic ciprofloxacin a million times higher than usually found in treated urban sewage. In Europe, sediments from the Sava river reveal antibiotic levels 1,000 times higher than normally expected. The first step of our project is to potentially find an enzyme that degrades multiple kinds of antibiotics found in water sources. To do this we talked with field professionals as well as did our own research, in order to find applicable antibiotics which could become water pollutants, leading to high levels of antibiotic resistance. After selecting the best enzymes for our purpose, our second step will be expressing them in laboratory Escherichia coli cells, in order to modify them via directed evolution for optimal activity in wastewater environments.
https://teams.igem.org/4365	Therapeutics	Chronic wounds are wounds that cannot progress through the normal stages of healing. They represent a growing problem, especially amongst aging populations and affect millions of patients each year. Chronic wounds are susceptible to bacterial infections and treatment relies heavily on antibiotics. Because of this, antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains are on the rise, increasing patient morbidity and mortality. To combat resistant bacteria-infections, we have adopted phage therapy. Our team has developed a bioresponsive hydrogel wound dressing for the treatment of chronic wounds. The bioresponsive hydrogel releases bacteriophages upon stimulation of the gel by proteases produced by the infected wound. Moreover, we have created new genetic parts and screened signal peptides to transform yeast into an efficient biofactory for the secretion of human growth factors. Using the same principles as in our bioresponsive phage-hydrogel, the secreted growth factors are released and can help chronic wounds to overcome inflammation and aid in healing.
https://teams.igem.org/4366	Environment	Wisconsin Lutheran College is located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin but is within only a few miles of abundant farmland. Agriculture is one of the biggest industries in the state and these products go all over the world. One important component in agricultural success is soil composition. It is essential to have the appropriate nutrients in the soil for crops to grow and provide a maximal return. Our team has engineered Escherichia coli to sense specific soil nutrients and provide a colorimetric readout of concentration. Our goal is to be able to measure the concentration of phosphate, nitrate, nitrite, and copper using nutrient-specific promoters controlling the expression of Beta-lactamase. While the nitrate and nitrite sensors did not work well, the phosphate and copper sensors have provided promising results. We aim to design a kit using these sensors to help farmers measure nutrients in the soil simply, affordably, and accurately.
https://teams.igem.org/4367	Diagnostics	The parasitic worm disease Schistosomiasis currently affects 240 million people worldwide and causes tens of thousands deaths every year. The current methods of treatment and diagnostics are insufficient. Therefore we wanted to develop a point of care test for DNA detection, enabling fast diagnosis and more accurate treatment of infected individuals. We have designed two separate systems. The first one is a cell free system that uses a fusion of dCas9 and split TEV protease. When bound to the target sequence it activates and induces alpha-complementation that forms the tetramer beta-galactosidase, which produces a blue pigment for a visual readout. The second method uses DNA-binding zinc fingers bound to the membrane of a yeast cell. Upon binding to the target sequence, production of the purple pigment violacein is induced as well as production of mating factor alpha. This induces the same genes in nearby cells, thereby amplifying the visible readout.
https://teams.igem.org/4368	Environment	From the StarchSTEM team of the University of Malaga we have always been very aware of the growing problem of vegetal wastes, not only in our country but also in all around the world. Due to this urgency to propose a solution to this adversity, our project has emerged which, thanks to synthetic biology, we have been able to carry it out. Thus, we have designed a specific protocol for obtaining plasmids containing the genes necessary for cellulose degradation and starch synthesis, as well as their corresponding fluorescent markers. The different cassettes have been integrated using the BioBrick Assemby method. The performance of the enzymes has been verified by colorimetric and enzymatic methods. With all this, we have come with the creation of bacterias capable of degrading plant residues and transforming them into starch have been obtained.
https://teams.igem.org/4369	Manufacturing	The short lifetime of equipment and dependance on insecure and costly supply routes not only cause safety issues for researchers on remote expeditions, but are also accountable for high amounts of CO2-emissions. By combining the opportunities of 3D-printing with a newly designed bioink, consisting of nitrogen-fixing Azotobacter vinelandii, we aim to provide an independent and sustainable solution for manufacturing in remote places such as space. Through overexpression of the hydrogel-forming polymer alginate and introduction of a cellulose synthesizing system, our setup provides workers and researchers with a modifiable system to manufacture small tools and consumables of various qualities on demand. By connecting the cellulose synthetase to an optogenetically inducable system, any products can be independently hardened upon exposure to blue light, enabling the opportunity to react to diverse circumstances. This way, CosMIC provides a solution for science to expand further into the yet unknown areas of our universe.
https://teams.igem.org/4370	Climate Crisis	The carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) is the most common greenhouse gas that overheats our planet. Here we present the proof of concept for making prolific producers of antibiotics autotrophic chassis by implementing the Calvin cycle in <i>Streptomyces</i>. To turn these bacteria into autotrophs, we cloned GC-rich sequences encoding RubisCO (Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate Carboxylase Oxygenase) and PRK (Phosphoribulokinase), key genes for the Calvin cycle. We have developed new genetic tools for the integration of these genes into the <i>Streptomyces</i> genome. Furthermore, to obtain antibiotic production in the minimal medium and implement the Calvin cycle, we engineered genetic tools via the CRISPR-dCas9 system to switch off the expression of genes of interest. Finally, we compared various <i>Streptomyces</i> strains, their phenotypic characteristics, and genomes to determine the best chassis for this project and generate a STREPTObook. The CO2CURE project will enable faster, more affordable, and sustainable bioproduction of antibiotics and many other useful derivatives.
https://teams.igem.org/4371	Environment	We observed the damage of river ecosystems caused by algae bloom in Republic of Korea this year, and community members suffered from algae bloom, with the odor of rivers and microcystin detected in tap water and various crops. Therefore, we have devised ABC biofilter, which solves this problem while also considering bio safety. Because anammox bacteria are difficult to cultivate, we produce enzymes necessary for the anammox process through cell free system, produce the biofilter with that enzymes which convert NO2- and NH4+ into N2 and prevent eutrophication which is the main cause of algae bloom. Also, we use cell free system to produce Superoxide dismutase (SOD) which produce H2O2 that remove green algae. Through this, we will prevent the algae bloom and remove green algae to maintain a healthy ecosystem of rivers and help people around the world from being harmed by algae bloom.
https://teams.igem.org/4372	Environment	The growing presence of antibiotic resistance that spreads through manure (via cow dung) in agricultural fields is a pertinent issue in India. Tetracycline is one such heavily used antibiotic. Oxytetracycline is, in fact, called the gold standard treatment in veterinary practice. Thus, to degrade residual antibiotics at their source i.e in cow dung, we use small laccase from Streptomyces coelicolor. By overexpressing it using a double promoter system, OmpA signal peptides and site directed mutagenesis, we developed Tetonin-a small laccase with a greater efficiency of degrading tetracycline in the cow dung. With Tetonin, agricultural stakeholders now have a way to reduce the presence of residual antibiotics in the cow dung that is eventually used as manure.
https://teams.igem.org/4373	Conservation	More than 70% of crop species are pollinated by bees. However, beekeepers in Europe and other regions worldwide have been reporting severe colony losses over the past decades. Pesticides are suspected to be one of the main contributors. One example is glyphosate which has several sublethal effects on honey bees including weakening the immune system and a decrease in brood survival. For Beecilli, we designed a probiotic that heterogeneously expresses glyphosate-degrading enzymes. These proteins act on the C-P or C-N bonds of glyphosate breaking it down. By incorporating the foreign DNA into the chromosomal DNA, we provide a stable construct that does not require a constant selection pressure and thus simplifies potential real-life applications.

The pandemic and all the social and environmental changes we are living in; droughts, wildfires, pollution, power shortage, lack of resources, and the need for more eco-friendly spaces have made us think. Our project's objective is to use plants as CO2 sensors. This requires the identification of promoter sequences highly and specifically induced by high CO2 concentrations. To develop our project first we study the different expression levels of several Arabidopsis thaliana CO2 inducible promoters under ambient and elevated CO2 conditions. As a proof of concept, we use the GFP reporter gene to measure the transcription level of each promoter using Nicotiana benthamiana transitory transformation.
https://teams.igem.org/4182	Environment	We provide an environmentally friendly bio-fertilizer, attempting to solve the problems caused by the widespread use of chemical herbicides by synthetic-biology. An engineered E. coli is constructed with the ability to produce a novel herbicide- aspartic acid and exopolysaccharides(EPS) under blue-light, and to controllably release them into soil triggered by heat, which will avoid excessive use and possible residue of herbicide, also promote water conservation and sand fixation by EPS. Our system consists of a precursor plasmid that converts the glucose to the key precursor GPP, and multiple functional plasmids with the ability to synthesize herbicide and EPS under the control of blue-light. Meanwhile, our engineered cells will release herbicide and EPS with the expression of a lysis gene under a higher temperature above 42oC. About 10% of the bacteria will escape the lysis procedure and recover, promoting a new round of controllable production and release of herbicide and EPS.
https://teams.igem.org/4183	High School	Lactose intolerance is a prevalent issue that cannot be overlooked. As much as 75% of the worlds human population is intolerant to ingested dietary lactose. We decided to use E. coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) as our chassis and make it synthesize &#946;-galactosidase (lacZ) with a secretory signal peptide, which can effectively prevent lactose uptake by EcN. Second, we plan to use enteric-coated pills to contain the freeze-dried bacteria for ingestion which helps the bacteria bypass the chemical barrier the gastric acid imposes and ensures safe transport to the intestines. Third, we aim to create a protective film using CAP (capsular polysaccharides surrounding) to ensure that the bacteria safely implant themself in the intestinal environment without damage. The CAP helps the bacteria adapt to a wider range of temperature and pH, shuts out harmful chemicals and toxins, as well as assisting them to stick to the intestinal walls.

The process of gold prospecting is time-consuming, costly and environmentally destructive. For instance, in low-income countries such as Ghana, open trenches are left by disappointed small-scale miners Our project seeks to reduce environmental degradation and time by engineering a number of E-Coli that separately detects the presence of Au and some selected pathfinder elements (As and Fe) that signal gold prospects in a location. These bacteria will be co-cultured to create a multifunctional biosensor. The engineered organisms are encapsulated in hydrogel spheres which will be placed in a stake which can driven into the soil up to 1-2m in depth to asses the presence of gold deposits. UV induced promoters which control lysozymes are incorporated in the biosensor to ensure bio-safety.
https://teams.igem.org/4188	Manufacturing	Monoterpenoids are versatile biomolecules with broad applications in healthcare, agriculture, and consumer products. However, large-scale applications remain rare, as traditional production methods rely on extraction from plants and chemical synthesis. This makes monoterpenoid production expensive and unsustainable. Microbial production of monoterpenoids is a promising alternative, but poor precursor availability, complicated expression of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYPs), and product toxicity limit their potential. MonChassis is overcoming current limitations by increasing precursor availability in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Yarrowia lipolytica by metabolic engineering, compartmentalization, and creating a cell-free, electrically-driven CYP system to circumvent product toxicity. With this, we established an adaptable platform for monoterpenoid production, allowing further deployment of monoterpenoids in unexplored areas. As a proof-of-concept , we produced verbenone, used to fight bark beetle invasion in forests locally, and globally. Thereby, MonChassis not only establishes a flexible production method for monoterpenoids without using plants but also contributes to the conservation of forests.
https://teams.igem.org/4190	Therapeutics	Diabetes Mellitus affects roughly 1 in 10 people globally and is the worlds seventh leading cause of death. However, 50 to 85% of all chronic complications are preventable by treatment and medication. Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists, such as Exendin-4, are one of the leading forms of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2D) treatments but are exceedingly expensive. Our initial studies used E. coli as an experimental model for Exendin-4 production; successes in those experiments led to homologous integration of Exendin-4 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae). As S. cerevisiae is Generally Regarded As Safe (GRAS) by the U.S. FDA, we hypothesize that Helo, once bio-encapsulated, can be administered as an oral T2D therapeutic. Our goal is for Helo to become an affordable T2D medication that can be propagated in as little as one square meter of space and distributed globally for communities and pharmacies to produce.

Open-air stone cultural relics, exposed outdoors for a long time, are susceptible to weathering damage. Nevertheless, parts of Lingyin Temple, a temple built from stone more than 1,000 years ago, are still intact due to the presence of natural calcium oxalate protective film. Inspired by this instance, CAU_China plan to use Bacteria-Induced Mineral Precipitation (BIMP) to replicate this protective film, by engineering Pseudomonas fluorescens to make it produce oxalic acid and consequently form a dense calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) protective film with the assistance of EPS. The realization of this technique will be a historical advance in the protection of stone relics, and will be the well-being of all cultural heritage stakeholders, present and future.
https://teams.igem.org/4200	Food & Nutrition	Vibriosis is a bacterial disease primarily observed in marine, estuarine, and occasionally, freshwater fish. It is caused by the bacteria of the genus Vibrio and is a significant reason for mortality in pisciculture operations. Among this species, Vibrio parahaemolyticus is one of the most prevalent pathogens. The problem remains substantial despite the pre-existing solutions like antibiotics, vaccines, and over-the-counter medicines. For this reason, we intend to design a sustainable alternative to them by synthesising an antimicrobial peptide that will bind to the Multivalent Adhesion Molecule 7 (MAM7)a surface protein present on the bacteria. MAM7 is responsible for bacterial adhesion to the host's epithelial cells, triggering the infection. Hence, by inhibiting adhesion, the infection will be prevented in its primary stage, consequently rendering the bacteria harmless to the fish. Our peptide would be synthesised by our chassisBL21, and delivered using chitosan nanoparticles.

Unfortunately, Paclitaxel is difficult to obtain and produce, with one dose requiring the harvest of six old-growth Pacific Yew trees. The development of complete and semi-complete chemical syntheses have improved extraction efforts, but production is still inefficient and expensive. The CU-Boulder iGEM Team is engineering a system in soybeans to produce Paclitaxel to increase the accessibility of this essential chemotherapeutic while decreasing the environmental impact of producing Paclitaxel. The paclitaxel precursor taxadiene can be synthesized in soybeans by genetically integrating enzymes that are naturally found in the Yew Tree. Soybeans can be easily farmed and are the most common genetically modified crop in the world.

Among all the damage factors, tiny cracks have received a lot of attention and are difficult to be restored by existing technologies. In order to overcome the challenges in restoring tiny cracks, ZJU-China is dedicated to developing technologies for the integrated conservation of stone artifacts based on engineered Bacillus subtilis induced biomineralization. Extracellular calcium carbonate precipitates are brought in for filling the tiny cracks of stone artifacts, with an extracellular scaffold system to further improve the physicochemical properties of the materials. We have also added a quorum sensing module and a biosafety module to make our materials environmentally friendly and efficient. Hopefully, Story Light will be a new technology for the integrated conservation of stone artifacts!

But the mechanism is not fully understood BJWZ-China is trying to be the first to explore a similar sensory system in microbes. We set out to exploit the "NAN-IAV pattern" of ion channels that make up auditory mechanotransduction in Drosophila. In the experiment, it was introduced into Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the auditory module was constructed. We transformed the designed plasmid into Escherichia coli for amplification and culture, and then transferred into yeast for yeast transformation by plasmid extraction. Yeast DNA was extracted for PCR verification, followed by electrophoresis verification. Finally, the transformers were prepared and frozen in glycerol tubes. By studying this life phenomenon, we conducted the first round of research for the project of sensing cancer, and preliminary exploration for the subsequent research of sound transduction in microorganisms.
https://teams.igem.org/4204	High School	The aim of our project is to develop a kit that can detect the presence of a common bacterial pathogen B. cereus, which is present in improperly stored leftover food and could cause digestive disease. Current detection methods including PCR-based tests are expensive and require specialized laboratory equipment. Here, we aim to develop an alternative detection method based on a B. cereus-specific endolysin (LysPBC5), ATP sensor, and the one-HOur Low-cost Multipurpose highly Efficient System (HOLMES). These two systems will be assembled by mixing purified LysPBC5 and Cas12b to form an efficient B. cereus test kit. To lower the cost of protein purification, we employed Pro-QC and crystal violet inducible protein expression system by reducing incomplete transcripts and the cost of inducer. Our design of the test kit could also guide the development of methods to detect other pathogens in the future.
https://teams.igem.org/4205	Therapeutics	Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with an estimated incidence of 1 percent worldwide, and no current medication proved effective for its treatment. Emerging evidence has indicated that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a key role in the development of ASD. Our project, Engine of Starlight, aims at alleviating mitochondrial dysfunction to treat ASD and comprises three systems that go from assessment to treatment. The first is a biosensor sensitive to lactic acid levels for mitochondrial dysfunction detection, while the other two are probiotics engineered to alleviate mitochondrial dysfunction by increasing NAD+ expression and preventing heavy metal accumulation in cells. We have successfully verified their function and further developed the delivery technique for intestinal colonization. Meanwhile, engineering iteration is conducted in interaction with our human practices, and we were also able to promote the implementation of the project with the support of hardware and software.

We will focus on the synthesis of acetic acid in particular.
https://teams.igem.org/4207	Food & Nutrition	Plant diseases are an increasing threat to global food security. As plant infections can rarely be visualized at early phases of plant-pathogen encounter, we sought to devise a bioassay kit that could identify an infection before phenotypic symptoms arise. For this purpose we developed a low-cost cell-free system to be used on-site, based on exchangeable toehold switches that respond to pathogen-specific gene sequences. As a demonstration, we built a novel toehold switch for detecting barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV), and compiled a library of alternative switches towards other pathogens to showcase system modularity. Reporter plasmids harboring the BYDV toehold switch were successfully constructed, and the reporter protein expression without the toehold was shown to work in a cell-free system. Although the function of the toehold-reporter combinations could not be verified, several iterations of system testing allowed us to pinpoint critical issues for the next steps of the assay development.
https://teams.igem.org/4208	Environment	Anatoxin-a is a cyanobacterial toxin which can be found in freshwater sources when numbers of cyanobacteria increase. Ingestion of the toxin may lead to death by suffocation by overstimulating the muscles responsible for breathing. Mainly dogs and farm animals consuming the contaminated water are affected. The current detection methods are laborious and require expensive chromatography and mass spectrometry equipment. This why in our project we aimed to develop an E.coli biosensor for a cheaper and easier detection of Anatoxin-a. We created a hybrid chemoreceptor which upon binding of the ligand induces the expression of GFP in the engineered E.coli. A plate reader can then be used to detect this signal.
https://teams.igem.org/4209	Environment	Quagga mussel (Dreissena bugensis) is an invasive species unintentionally introduced in Switzerland in 2014. Its damages include pipes clogging, inducing millions of Swiss francs of costs in Switzerland, and altering the local ecosystems of Swiss lakes. Our project aims to stop the spread of this species in two ways: by overexpressing the FitD toxin which has molluscicide and insecticides properties, naturally produced by Pseudomonas protegens. Then by engineering Escherichia coli to produce zosteric acid, an antifoulant compound that will prevent mussels attachment to surfaces. We successfully created plasmids expressing enzymes for zosteric acid production. They are now ready for testing and optimization. We also cloned several constructs to overexpress FitD. In our experiments with the mussels, we demonstrated that our engineered bacteria can indeed kill the mussels and we identified the most potent construct. Our results promise an efficient and ecological way to address the quagga mussels invasion.

However, they are toxic to bees and run-off from fields poisons fish and aquatic invertebrates. Here we report the successful development of a cheap in-field biosensor for lambda-cyhalothrin based on aptamer technology which produces an easy-to-read colour change. We demonstrated our biosensors target could be extended to fenitrothion, a second pesticide, with only minor changes. To enhance pyrethroid breakdown, we engineered a whole cell catalyst utilising a carboxylesterase from Bacillus velezensis. To improve activity and improve membrane insertion, we linked the carboxylesterase to a modified anchor protein isolated from Pseudomonas syringae. To explore growth-production trade-offs we developed an ordinary differential equation model of microbial gene expression and growth. Working under guidance from farmers and other stakeholders, we developed a spatial model to enable the optimisation of potential deployment strategies in the field.
https://teams.igem.org/4211	Manufacturing	Skin tissue defects caused by various wound factors are very common clinically. Relying on the epithelium and basal tissue of their own wound margins, severe wounds and chronic wounds such as extensive burns and venous ulcers are difficult to heal. Tissue engineering scaffolds have great advantages in repairing skin wounds. The excellent properties of bacterial cellulose (BC) make it to be qualified as a high-quality tissue engineering scaffold. However, cellulose is non-degradable in vivo, which is a knotty problem that restricts its application at present. BCAID provides a solution in synthetic biology for the real application of BC tissue engineering scaffolds in human body, which is of great significance for repairing skin tissue wounds. BCAID is divided into basic BC production module, healing promoting module, blue-light activated BC degradation module and red-light activated engineered fibroblast(BJ) suicide module. The four modules constitute the whole BCAID with complete functions and excellent characteristics.
https://teams.igem.org/4212	Europe	Over the next 35 years, the worlds growing population will demand more food than has ever been produced in human history. A major source of yield loss are fungal pathogens, constituting 75% of all plant diseases. Current solutions are falling short, with farmers relying on unselective spraying of fungicides due to delayed emergence of visible symptoms, often missing the early stages of infection when treatment is most effective. We propose Sporadicate, a broad-spectrum biofungicide based on Bacillus subtilis spores that eliminates the time-lag between diagnosis and treatment. Our bacterial spores are engineered to display chitinase enzymes on the surface, which degrade the cell wall of pathogenic fungi. This generates a biomarker that can be detected via a modified receptor  enabling spores to selectively germinate into vegetative cells exhibiting biocontrol properties. Given the innate durable properties of spores, our system would be robust, easily storable, widely applicable, and cost-effective.
https://teams.igem.org/4213	Environment	The Thessalian plain was one of the most fertile valleys of ancient Greece. Today, its intensive exploitation has led to the eutrophication of both Lake Karla and the Pinios River. Inorganic phosphate accumulation in water causes the formation of harmful algal blooms that produce cyanotoxins, leading to aquatic ecosystem deterioration. Our team aims to develop a universal monitoring and phytoremediation approach for eutrophic waters. The monitoring system will evaluate the ecological status of the water body and, wherever it indicates critical levels of eutrophication, a constructed floating wetland (CFW) will be implemented. The CFW will be made of biodegradable mycelium carrying genetically engineered plants. Once plant roots detect cyanotoxins via a novel synthetic riboswitch, they will overexpress PHT1 transporters that will enhance phosphate uptake. Plant shoots and leaves will stand over the CFW and will be eventually harvested and converted into fertilizer.

Both of these types result in malabsorption of dietary B12 and result in B12 deficiency in the long term. Currently, high dosage B12 is administered to patients intravenously, intramuscularly and to a lesser extent orally, to circumvent malabsorption. Our solution aims to treat PA with a protein therapeutic consisting of an engineered IF which has phenotype-improving mutations in the autoantibody-binding epitope. Successful mutants were generated using site-directed mutagenesis and were surface displayed in mammalian cells to validate the autoantibody and B12 binding. In the future, we are aiming to offer our treatment in the form of pills which include IF bound to B12 for optimised absorption of vitamin B12 and thus, increasing the quality of life for the patients.

https://teams.igem.org/4216	Village	Language originating from the field of electronics is often employed in synthetic biology to describe genetic logic circuits, meanwhile, the real intersection of electronics with genetics remains largely unexplored. Our iGEM team is developing a toolkit of genetic parts with the concomitant open-source hardware to enable synthetic biologists to interface bacterial gene expression with electronics. Our toolkit incorporates a multitude of genetic parts from previous research in electro-microbiology that have been standardised to allow for a wide variety of applications. We are conversely researching new means of bioelectronic control using hyperpolarization of bacterial membranes for gene induction. Our toolkit will open doors for foundational research in gene expression and control while finding applications in manufacturing, robotics, arts and new media.
https://teams.igem.org/4217	Environment	Manganese above World Health Organization limits is associated with neurologic dysfunction and Parkinsons-like disease. Despite the increase in manganese discharges from industrial runoffs and the resulting increase in manganese contamination of water sources, applications for the detection and bioremediation of manganese are not widely available, cost-effective, or easy to maintain. We are developing an E.coli expressed biosensor for the detection of manganese contamination in water samples. The sensor consists of a manganese-responsive promoter and riboswitch driving expression of a superfolder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP). The sensor is currently capable of detecting manganese down to 1mM, and efforts are underway to increase its sensitivity. Once the system is optimized, we plan to replace sfGFP with phytochelatin as a means of chelating manganese from drinking water. It is our hope that our system will provide a cost-effective and fieldable alternative to existing means of manganese detection and removal.
https://teams.igem.org/4218	High School	Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are the commonest hematologic malignancies in the elderly. Now, the accurate diagnosis of MDS still heavily rely on the experienced hematologists morphological evaluation of peripheral blood and bone marrow cells. Therefore, it is urgent to develop more effective detection methods for MDS diagnosis. Aberrant splicing is strongly associated with MDS. Many RNA splicing-related genes have been found to mutate in around 50% of MDS patients, suggesting analysis of RNA splicing status should be used for diagnosis of MDS. It is reported that exons of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 7 (MAP3K7) and zinc finger protein 91 (ZFN91) were skipped in MDS patients. This inspired us of constructing sensors fused the skipping exons into the plasmids containing reporter, which monitors the alteration of RNA splicing in cells. Our project provides a simple and effective method for early diagnosis and prediction of prognosis in MDS in the future.
https://teams.igem.org/4219	Foundational Advance	The use of RNA as a therapeutic tool is a new frontier of disease treatment, but for it to be safe, therapeutic mRNA translation must be limited to a specific cell type. Commonly, delivery vehicles are used to target cells according to cellular membrane characteristics, but such methods have many limitations, including insufficient specificity. A switch module on the 5 UTR of the mRNA that senses and responds to a specific endogenous RNA trigger in the target cell, can be used in parallel to enhance specificity. To date, such a switch module has been used successfully in prokaryotes, including by many IGEM teams, but not in eukaryotes, and tools to design them efficiently are lacking. We are creating an innovative, user-friendly, generic software tool for designing switch modules in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes using new algorithms and models which will assist in generating efficient, selectively translated mRNA molecules.
https://teams.igem.org/4220	WIKI	RSPOs (R-spondins) belong to a family of secreted proteins that was the leading cause of various cancers. In iGEM2022, NEU_CHINA team focused on developing a novel cancer targeted-therapy against all RSPOs. We originally designed and characterized a chimeric protein RTAC (RSPO-Targeting Anti-cancer Chimeric protein) through protein engineering. RTAC showed satisfactory anti-cancer effect through inhibition of RSPO-mediated Wnt/&#946;-catenin signaling activation. For further improvement, a S.Cerevisiae-based probiotic was engineered, named as R-yeast, to deliver RTAC to RSPO-hyperactivated colorectal cancer locally. The mating pathway of R-yeast was reprogrammed to specifically sense the tumor environment-specific molecules, thus expressing RTAC in a self-tunable manner. Meanwhile, a unique copper-dependent kill switch was implanted to avoid R-yeast from causing potential environmental hazard. Collectively, we have presented the proof-of-concept of a novel anti-pan-RSPO protein and a probiotic with self-controllable machineries for cancer targeted treatment. Our work thus promises great value in synthetic biological research and translational medicine.
https://teams.igem.org/4221	High School	Hydrophobins are small surface-active amphiphilic proteins that contain both hydrophobic and hydrophilic areas on their surface. They can self-assemble to form a stable film at the interface of both polar and non-polar solution phases. Thanks to high surface activity and amphiphilicity, Hydrophobins have broad application prospects as surfactants in interface engineering, emulsifiers in food processing, bioimmobilization agents in nanotechnology, and powerful protein purification tags in biotechnology. Our project features BslA, a bacterial-origin hydrophobin with great potential and wide application in synthetic biology. BslA is much easier to produce compared to their fungal-origin cousins, which overcomes the limitations of their industrial use. We hope to unleash the potential of BslA and solve some of the major concerns of the synbio community and humanity as a whole. To this end, Our team designed three BslA fusion proteins that target three problems: protein purification, antibiotic abuse, and plastic pollution.

https://teams.igem.org/4223	Diagnostics	Since the discovery of penicillin by Fleming in 1929, antibiotic research has developed rapidly and the large-scale use of antibiotics has brought about serious problems of microbial resistance. Combined with human activities, the cross-species and cross-habitat spread of drug-resistant microorganisms and antibiotic-resistant genes occurred at the"Human-marine animal-environment" interface. Antibiotics and their metabolites were enriched in the environment, spread to human by marine animals and animal products, produced drug-resistant microorganisms and caused the spread of drug-resistant genes,which has been a serious impact on human health. At present, there is no rapid detection instrument in the field of marine environmental monitoring to characterize microbial resistance in seawater. Based on the combination of CRISPR/CAS system and CSM6 protein, we identify mutagenic genes with single-base precision,detect specific drug-resistant genes in marine microorganisms and develop a platform for rapid detection of drug resistance in marine microorganisms.
https://teams.igem.org/4224	High School	Lactose intolerance indicates intestinal discomfort caused by decreased beta-galactosidase to digest lactose. Since lactase hydrolyses lactose into glucose and galactose, when the expression of lactase declines due to genetic disorder or natural ageing, the amount of lactose people can tolerate will decrease. It is a worldwide health problem that about 70% of the world population suffered from lactose intolerance. Notably, the incidence is particularly high in Asia because the downward trend of expressing lactase is strengthened by diets rarely containing lactose. In the dairy industry, Aspergillus oryzae is one of the most widely used fungal sources of beta-galactosidase (lacA) to produce lactose-free products for people with lactose intolerance. To allow people with lactose intolerance to enjoy dairy products, our project aims to express lacA heterologously in Pichia pastoris, quantify the enzymatic property of lacA, and optimise the culture conditions of recombined Pichia pastors.
https://teams.igem.org/4225	Food & Nutrition	Fresh seafood products are highly susceptible to spoilage, so it is important to monitor their quality throughout storage and delivery. We aim to create a colorimetric biosensor that detects bioamine levels in raw fish, as high levels of bioamines signify the degradation of meat quality and cause bioamine poisoning. Our circuit detects the bioamine levels by converting them into H2O2 with rat diamine oxidase. H2O2 subsequently oxidizes the transcription factor OxyR, activating the katG promoter, which drives the expression of a red output. Essentially, the system turns green if the fish is safe to consume and red when it is spoiled. We use an E. coli-based cell-free system as the detection mechanism in our biosensor and a swab test will be done for extracting the final sample by users. Compared to current products, our biosensor will be a more ready-to-use, intuitive, and robust indicator of fresh fish quality.

In other IGEM team projects, the kill switch is often used to ensure the biosafety of the project.

https://teams.igem.org/4227	Therapeutics	Oral problems are widespread among people of different ages. Most oral problems can be preventable and treated in their early stages, especially for the universal tooth decay deduced by Streptococcus mutans. This project is seeking a low-cost and convenient way to prevent oral diseases by developing oral probiotics based on GRAS strain-Bacillus subtilis. With introduction of quorum sensing system from S. mutans, the switch of our designed genetic circuits would be triggered by sensing competence-stimulating peptide (CSP, quorum sensing signaling molecule with concentration positively correlated with the number of S. mutans).Our Healthy Teeth Legion project designed multiple genetic circuits to achieve the purpose of detecting oral hygiene and preventing dental caries, as well as achieving convenient feedback of test results. For safety reasons, termination switch has been added accordingly. With combination of scientific research, computer modeling and extensive experimental data,more reliable and convenient Healthy Teeth Legion would be developed.
https://teams.igem.org/4229	Foundational Advance	Despite their small size, bacteria have sophisticated and dynamic internal organization, featuring distinct microenvironments optimized for a given task, such as carboxysomes that perform CO2 fixation. We aimed to engineer and compare different compartmentalization systems (rigid shells and liquid droplets) for their ability to localize enzymes and promote metabolic processes due to reduced formation of toxic side-products and more efficient interplay between pathway components thanks to physical proximity. Using computational structural biology, we predicted sites at which the incorporation of a non-canonical amino acid (ncAA) could influence pore size. To facilitate the use of ncAAs for future iGEM teams, we developed INCLUSIVE, a database collecting the important information from the literature. Furthermore, we investigated the impact of genome reduction on compartment formation and metabolic pathway output. In conclusion, our project lays the foundations for using compartmentalization as a tool to exploit the full power of bacterial cells.

https://teams.igem.org/4231	Therapeutics	Lipid nanoparticle (LNP) is a novel pharmaceutical drug delivery system and a novel pharmaceutical formulation. But this promising drug delivery system has no effect on many cerebral diseases due to the difficulty in drug delivery across the bloodbrain barrier (BBB). In our project, we developed Bor-NP, a novel nanoparticle modified by borneol, which has been proved with the ability to enhance other drugs transport across the BBB. At the same time, we tried to establish a system which can mass-produce this kind of Bor-NP. We took advantage of Yarrowia lipolytica to boost the borneol production, and then conjugate these borneol to the succinimide group of N-hydroxy succinimidepoly(ethyleneglycol)poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (NHS-PEG-PLGA) to produce the Bor-NP. In a conclusion, our project focused on producing nanoparticles to get through the BBB and establishing an effective bio-manufacturing system to produce this kind of nanoparticle to lower the cost and achieve better therapeutic effect.

Many enzymes used in biosynthsis need to be isolated from oxygen&#65292;while microbial respiration cannot produces energy without oxygen. At present, physical means are mainly used to infuse nitrogen to create a hypoxic environment, which cannot meet all application scenarios. Therefore, this year, BIT-China team was committed to creating an intracellular hypoxic environment at normal metabolic levels of microorganisms, using Escherichia coli to express functional elements for introducing synthesis modules to promote product efficiency. In addition, we also built an easy-to-use toolbox for BP neural network prediction to facilitate future practitioners to model.
https://teams.igem.org/4233	Therapeutics	The highly pathogenic avian influenza virus sweeps through the world. Current biosecurity and prevention strategies (e.g. intravenous vaccination) are insufficient and logistical nightmares, resulting in deaths of millions of poultry worldwide. With Nanobuddy we propose a novel solution by engineering Lactobacillus reuteri, a native species in the lung and intestinal microbiome of chickens, to secrete broadly neutralizing nanobodies against bird flu. These nanobodies bind to a conserved region of the viruss hemagglutinin receptor, blocking it from entering cells. We researched several facets of our project: We investigated L. reuteris ability to secrete nanobodies and explored via lung-microbiomics L. reuteris presence in Dutch chickens. We explored the efficacy of the anti-avian influenza nanobodies and proposed an in-silico nanobody design workflow. Additionally, we developed a temperature sensitive biosafety module and performed extensive human practice to inform our final product. Nanobuddy, administered as a convenient spray, might revolutionize the fight against avian influenza.
https://teams.igem.org/4238	Foundational Advance	Biosafety and security is the key to the new generation of synthetic biology. Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) have shown us much potential for solving global issues. Yet, the release of GMOs in the natural environment has been a huge safety concern, inhibiting the implementation into the wider society. Also, to encourage innovation, It is crucial to protect the intellectual property, in particular the gene sequence of GMOs, and GMOs themselves, from malicious interest and dual-use. This year, we present OPTOPASS, an optogenetic passcode system for microorganisms. In this system, S.cerevisiae produces the target substances only when exposed to the correct color of light in the correct order. However, when the light is applied in the wrong order or the culture is left under the sunlight, a kill switch is activated. Using our unique approach combining Light and Order, OPTOPASS proposes greater safety and security for the future of synthetic biology.
https://teams.igem.org/4239	Food & Nutrition	Food security is an immense challenge nowadays, particularly as crops are further endangered each year by new bacterial phytopathogens. The current tools to study pathogens are not efficient. Our project, FIAT LUX, based on an improved version of the luxCDABE operon ilux, aims at simplifying the use of luminescence as a reporter gene, notably for in vivo infection studies. It enables the tracking of luminescent bacterial spread in tissues, without having to sample or kill the host. Our team has focused the proof of concept on the soft rot disease in potatoes, caused by Dickeya. FIAT LUX is a promising tool to better understand this infection, helping to combat it and would contribute towards building more sustainable agricultural practices. After iGEM, we will extend the use of FIAT LUX to as many host-pathogen relationships as possible, and it may also be useful in the future to study beneficial symbiotic interactions.
https://teams.igem.org/4240	Software & AI	Usually, a complete metabolic pathway contains multiple nodes and multi-step reactions. Sometimes there is no readily suitable enzyme in the database for the catalysis of the reaction, which brings some difficulties to the study. Although some pathway design software, such as PathPred, can predict the entire metabolic pathway, it is still inevitable that intermediate reactions will be disconnected. Therefore, Modified Enzyme Interface (MEI) is designed to provide enzyme candidates to catalyze unknown reactions. With the premise of single step reaction, MEI screened out the potential enzymes by using a structure comparison algorithm. On this basis, users can select the enzyme for further modification, which is more likely to obtain efficient enzymes that can catalyze the target reaction. With MEI, we hope to help synthetic biologists shorten the experimental time and find the desired enzyme more quickly.
https://teams.igem.org/4241	Foundational Advance	Antimicrobial resistance is a global phenomenon arising from the indiscriminate use of antibiotics. To combat this problem, the Antimicrobial Peptide Cecropin B (CecB), a highly-effective, broad-spectrum antibiotic alternative is expressed in transgenic Chlorella autotrophica, a well-studied and highly-productive protein expressing microalgal chassis. It is expressed with a secretion signal peptide for extraction; and SUMO-tag for in-vitro cleavage using SUMO-protease. To validate efficacy, the isolated CecB is tested against common aquatic pathogens. The in-vitro cleavage system, barring the signal peptide, is also expressed using a bacterial chassis. This is to test the design and quantify the differences between microalgal and bacterial synthetic capabilities. To modify the system for industrial use, the signal peptide is removed and the SUMO-protease is additionally inserted, under a nitrogen-starvation inducible promoter, to cleave SUMO in-vivo and generate active AMPs. The microalgae are then freeze-dried, preserving active AMPs internally, which can then be used as supplemental feed.
https://teams.igem.org/4242	Therapeutics	In nature, microbes can exist as either planktonic or biofilm. Once pathogens biofilm is formed in human body, it will be rather hard to eradicate. The second messenger c-di-GMP is a positive regulator of biofilm formation, and c-di-GMP signaling is regarded as a potential target for the development of antipathogenic compounds. However, it has not been possible to monitor c-di-GMP levels in real time in many bacteria, which limits to effectively screen c-di-GMP-targeted antipathogenic compounds. To overcome this limitation, we will construct a c-di-GMP biosensor that is readily adaptable for gauging c-di-GMP levels in different bacteria. To demonstrate the application of the c-di-GMP biosensor, we will use it as a tool to screen agents that can induce Escherichia coli and Shewanella oneidensis biofilm dispersal by decreasing its c-di-GMP levels.

https://teams.igem.org/4248	High School	This research aims to find an alternative solution to bacterial inhibition. Currently, antibiotics are popular choices due to their effectiveness against microorganism infection, while their abuse leads to bacterial resistance issues thus posing a huge threat to global health. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are alkaline polypeptides that can inhibit bacterial activity without causing bacterial resistance. For this issue, we developed five types of AMPs based on the following functional genes: Hydramacin-1, Spheniscin-2, Sparamosin26-54, LL-37, and fusion. The target gene was integrated into plasmid pET28a(+), expressing AMPs in E.coli BL21(DE3) competent cells. Besides the development of bacterial inhibition functions, the fusion AMP has antifungal abilities. Because the aquariums regularly replace a lot of water, we hope that the AMPs created can shed light on a more convenient method of fish tank cleaning to save water resources. Key Words: AMPs, gene

Finding an effective way to scavenge free radicals is thought to be one of food and cosmetic industries. Ergothioneine (EGT), a natural antioxidant, which is commonly found in mushrooms, has fairly powerful properties. However, human body cannot synthesize it, as a result, there is a huge market demand for the production of Ergothioneine. Our main goal is to achieve higher production of EGT. We engineered s yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a chassis for the production of EGT. We applied CRISPR-Cas9 technology to integrate two genes into the yeast genome, and succeeded in constructing EGT biosynthesis pathway in S.cerevisiae. Additionally, the production can be further improved after optimizing the media with proper concentration of amino acids, which is the precursor of EGT. This work offers a more sustainable, low cost and efficient approach for the industrial production of EGT.

Our project focuses on three native genetic parts related to phosphorus metabolism in E.coli genome. Pst complex, which generally express during phosphorus starvation, is used to absorb phosphate efficiently. Phosphate in cytoplasm of E.coli can polymerize to create poly-phosphate(polyP) as the storage form. This process is conducted by mutated PPK protein. YjbB complex, which generally conducts phosphate release, is regulated for phosphate recycling.The framework of these parts is conducted by a thermal-sensitive repressor called cI857.

https://teams.igem.org/4257	Manufacturing	Low oxidation state phosphite, the dominant form of phosphorus on terrestrial planets, posed a formidable challenge on future interstellar migration. Involved in every aspect of life, phosphate rather phosphite is indispensable in the progress of human civilization. Thus, manufacture phosphate form phosphite is key to future success. Herein, by coupling phosphite dehydrogenase (PD) and polyphosphate kinase (PPK), we proposed a strategy that can spur E. coli to continuously produce phosphate from phosphite. In our engineered metabolic pathway, polyphosphate that derived from intracellular ATP is the crucial intermediate. Given that one phosphoric acid radical of ATP is deprived by PPK for polyphosphate synthesis, regeneration of ATP necessitated the oxidation of more phosphite by PD, thus achieving a high phosphate yield. In addition, to achieve the production trial in the context of terrestrial planets, we developed solar-energy driven algae processing hardware aiming at providing oxygen and nutrients for the engineered chassis.

Currently most textile dyeing relies on the use of azo dyes. These dyes can be carcinogenic, photosynthesis reducing agents, and contain heavy metals. They are also highly stable which makes them long lasting in an aquatic ecosystem. We want to replace this with a non-toxic, protein based dye that will denature in an aquatic environment. Many bacteria already produce natural pigments in a wide variety of colors that could be used in the dyeing process. We combined a naturally occurring pigment with a cellulose binding domain to allow for increased pigment retention in cotton fabrics. This process included creating multiple constructs to find optimal protein orientation. Our product will be able to replace the harmful synthetic dyes by offering a sustainable, environmentally safe alternative.

Biological production of nanoparticles for PTT is superior to other synthesis methods. Our team developed a microbial factory to produce these nanoparticles by overexpressing the genes napA, copA, cueO, and melA in Escherichia coli BL21. These strains supernatants were used to reduce silver and gold ions and form bimetallic nanoparticles. The nanoparticles were analyzed using spectrophotometry and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). We employed a statistical model called Box-Behnken Design to optimize absorbance at 800 nm.

The disease persists despite 40 years of available treatments because current methods are reactionary, inaccessible to affected communities, and slowly becoming ineffective. SchistoGONE introduces a novel, environmental approach to permanently ending schistosomiasis by exploiting the sporocyst stage of schistosoma residing in biomphalaria glabrata. SchistsoGONE starts with the biosynthesis of plant-based, anti-schistosomal compound sanguinarine using a 7 plasmid e.coli and W303 s.cerevisiae combinationan optimized biosynthesis pathway and insurance that environmental containment breach releases only benign substrates. Modified microorganisms are contained in specially designed plates situated by bodies of water that allow easy access for biomphalaria glabrata snails, naturally attracted to yeast. The resultant consumption of sanguinarine by the sole intermediary host of schistosoma eradicates residing sporocysts. SchistoGONE can save the lives of nearly a billion and improve countless more by eradicating schistosomiasis at its source.

The UChicago iGEM 2022 team has begun developing a bacterial biosensor using a T7 polymerase to amplify a fluorescent signal upon PFOA detection. A promoter found in bacterial species Rhodococcus jostii, known as prmA, responds to the presence of PFOA in the environment. Previous work by USAFA iGEM 2019 showed that driving red fluorescent protein expression using only prmA yielded low RFP expression. Therefore, our designed system uses prmA to drive expression of a T7 polymerase. By placing a T7 promoter upstream of a green fluorescent protein gene, our design aims to amplify GFP to visible levels, allowing for easy, inexpensive water testing in the field.

Patchoulol can be obtained by natural extraction, chemical synthesis, and synthetic biology engineering. However, the natural extraction is often low-efficiency, and the chemical synthesis is often costly and inefficient, and may not yield enantiomerically pure patchoulol. We engineered high level patchoulol production in yeast by overexpression of farnesyl diphosphate synthase(FPS, ERG20) and patchoulol synthase (PTS) either driven by strong promoter or light-induced promoter HIGH CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE173 (HCF173). The strategy increased the synthesis of patchoulol, which may also provide the foundations to generat higher levels of other terpenes for research, industrial production or therapeutic applications.
https://teams.igem.org/4271	High School	In various water bodies, the overabundance of nutrients from agricultural chemicals, including fertilizers and biocides, resulted in the process of eutrophication. The increase of phosphate and nitrogen amounts leads to algal bloom followed by the decline in sustainability of lives in the water bodies. The physical and chemical solutions that currently exist are limited to certain conditions and could potentially disturb the ecosystem. Our project presents a new method to solve the issue of eutrophication from its roots. By engineering bacteria that overexpress organophosphorus hydrolase (OPH) and antisense PhoU mRNA (AsPhoU), we can hydrolyze organic phosphates into inorganic phosphate (Pi) for detoxification, enhance the efficacy of Pi transport, and fix the excess of Pi into polyphosphate (polyP), respectively. The implementation of a filtering device containing the engineered bacteria with biosensors for the detection of polyphosphate accumulation could reduce phosphate levels in water bodies to ultimately prevent the cycle of eutrophication.

This kind of protein has the advantages of diverse intrinsic mechanisms, broad-spectrum, ease of use, and is genetically encodable. Therefore, it not only improves gene editing safety by reducing off-target effects but also has great potential for development and use in the field of synthetic biology. Our software constructs a prediction model based on the Random Forest algorithm by computing, extracting, and integrating features in the protein itself as well as in the genomic sequence to find the most likely candidates from the input complete genome, hoping to provide biology researchers and synthetic biologists with an integrated and convenient Anti-CRISPR protein mining tool.

Mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) are natural products produced by various marine organisms such as cyanobacteria and algae, able to absorb UV radiation. However, the low rate of MAA production limits the potential of commercializing MAAs as sunscreen ingredient. This year, LINKS_China engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae to produce three MAAsshinorine, porphyra-334 and palythineand another UV-absorbing molecule, gadusol. We incorporated enzymes from Nostoc punctiforme, Nostoc linckia and Actinosynnema mirum to structure the optimal pathway, and introduced the xylose metabolism pathway to increase yield. These yeast products has successfully absorbed UV radiation, covering most UVA and UVB rays. For skin repairing, we introduced superoxide dismutase and catalase to remove reactive oxidative species produced in the skin. UV-PRISMA, our MAA-based sunscreen product, will bring a healthier, gentler, and more environmentally friendly way of UV protection.

Our goal is to strengthen the MCFAs synthesis pathway and optimize T7 initiation by over-expressing key enzymes in the reverse fatty acid &#946;-oxidation cycle in E. coli to increase the production of MCFAs. We constructed the pET28a-EGFP plasmid with a fluorescent protein. In order to find the mutation that works the best, we designed point mutations C1, C2, C3, and C4 on the T7 promoter, and constructed these four T7 promoter mutants on plasmids. We found out that the C1 mutation was the strongest promoter, which hooked up the selected mutations to the four enzymes that build the medium-chain fatty acids. This mutated promoter was then applied to the four enzymes used in our pathway to increase the amount of medium-chain fatty acids production. Key Words: MCFAs, &#946;-oxidation cycle

This year, we developed a comprehensive solution, which was integrated from three strategies functioning on prevention, detection and treatment of R.solani respectively. To prevent the infection of R.solani, we cut off the water and air transmission routes of R.solani, by using biocontrol fungi - Trichoderma atroviride. For the early detection of rice sheath blight, we developed LAMP and E-nose detection systems. And we also developed stabilized RNAi effector molecules binding with nanomaterials to specifically inhibit and kill R.solani. In brief, we hope to build an efficient and comprehensive system, thereby contributing our strength to the prevention and control of rice sheath blight.

It's estimated that &#8764;2% of the population are affected by chronic wounds in the United States alone. We aim to produce wound-healing "plasters" with particularly high biocompatibility for poorly healing open wounds from synthetically produced spider threads. To accomplish this, we produce spidroins (spider silk proteins) with modified Escherichia coli. After protein purification, the threads would be spun to bundle them. The tissue would be applied directly to the previously cleaned and disinfected affected area. Promotion of wound healing in the inflammation, granulation and regeneration phases would be achieved by incorporating the moist wound environment through the patch as part of a synthetic skin.

By imitating a single-layered perceptron, an input pattern is converted into an intermediate signal in a weighted manner. Then, using an activation function, it is classified to a specific class. Our system is built on a population scale to avoid the metabolic burden of a single-cell system by taking advantage of the natural ways bacteria communicate, i.e., exploiting bacterial quorum sensing signals, Acyl-Homoserine-Lactones, in E.Coli consortia. Ribosome Binding Site variants are used as plug-and-play devices to tune the weights, and a steep genetic activation function is built to engineer a living binary classifier.

Common wheat (Triticum aestivum) is a crop that is both severely affected by heat and vital for global nutrition; therefore, producing heat-tolerant wheat varieties would be an essential step toward global food security. Synaestivum aims to reach this objective through the heat-inducible expression of enzymes that offset metabolic stress under heat conditions, prevent protein misfolding, and increase yield through an optimized photosynthetic rate. As a proof of concept, we optimized the isolation of wheat protoplasts to validate the expression of this genetic system. As complementary efforts to validate our design and implementation, we built a hardware device that detects activation of our constructs for implementation in the field, and utilized bioinformatic analyses to confirm that the gene pathways in our design are significantly overexpressed in heat conditions.
https://teams.igem.org/4297	High School	2-phenylethanol (2-PE) is a fatty alcohol with the aroma of rose, which is considered as an essential flavoring ingredient in the food and cosmetic industry because of its mild and elegant smell. In nature, 2-PE is mainly extracted from rose, jasmine, tomato, and buckwheat plants. However, the concentration of 2-PE in plants is deficient and susceptible to natural factors, such as weather and plant diseases, resulting in the cost of extracting 2-PE up to 3500-6000 USD/kg. Cheap 2-PE can be prepared by chemical synthesis, but the process of producing benzene ethanol by chemical synthesis is complicated. Therefore, we constructed an engineered strain utilizing synthetic biology, so that it can synthesize natural, green, and sustainable 2-PE to meet the needs of the food and cosmetics industry. We hope our obtained 2-pE can be developed to trend-leading and unique 2-PE products according to different people and scenarios.

Among many solutions against this crisis, EPI (Efflux Pump Inhibiter) is a potentially efficient kind of medicine in response to drug resistance generated by efflux pumps, the most important mechanism of antibiotic resistance. However, most of current EPI have several disadvantages: Difficult to synthesize, Toxic and Low effect commendably, which hinders its further clinical application. Our project aimed to develop a standardized modular short-peptide EPI optimization procedure based on directed evolution and Yeast-E.coli co-culture system. Through this procedure, as long as we know the structure of an efflux pump, we could generate an efficient EPI that could been synthesized by microorganisms easily. For security reasons&#65292;we used AcrB pump in E.coli as a demonstration of our project and successfully constructed the co-culture system this summer.

https://teams.igem.org/4299	Village	Uric acid (C5H4N4O) is the end-product of purine catabolism. The increased consumption of foods such as red meat, seafood, and alcoholic beverages is directly associated with high uric acid blood levels and a higher prevalence of hyperuricemia. Hyperuricemia can lead to the formation of urate stones and gout and is an independent risk factor for hypertension, chronic kidney disease, cancer, and mortality. Adverse side effects and disadvantages have been identified for existing treatment methods, which confirm the need for a much safer uric acid-lowering treatment therapy with no adverse side effects. Our project introduces exogenous uricase as a novel treatment method. We utilized molecular cloning technologies to insert the gene encoding for urate oxidase into Escherichia Coli, uricase oxidase can decompose uric acid. Our method is associated with various long-term, sustainable benefits, and does not correlate with any adverse side effects.

To help relieve depression, our team developed a probiotic to regulate depression, based on the gut-brain axis. Since it has been previously proven that 5-HTP can increase the concentration of serotine in the brain to improve mood, and GABA can block certain nerve cells to inhibit anxiety and stress, we overexpressed the TPH1 gene into E.coli Nissle 1917(EcN) to catalyze the production of tryptophan which consequently catalyzes the biopterin-dependent monooxygenation of tryptophan to 5-HTP. Meanwhile, we overexpressed the GadB gene in EcN to convert the glutamate to GABA using pyridoxal phosphate (the active form of vitamin B6) as a cofactor. To prevent genetically modified contamination, our team developed a suicide system for the strain. This probiotic has the potential to establish a more peaceful society with higher productivity.

Therefore, with the knowledge of synthetic biology, our team is currently designing a non-impairment uric acid sensor that replaces blood tests with urine tests, more precisely, a uric acid test method conducted using urine collected from patients. The test consists of the following three steps. Firstly, the sensor system works as the specific genes transcribe and release signals with the detection of uric acid in the urine. Secondly, the amplification system magnifies the fluorescent signal of the engineered bacteria by compounding DNA sequence hrpRS. Thirdly, the luminosity system displays light signal that could be used to calculate the uric acid concentration.

https://teams.igem.org/4305	High School	Due to the rapid pace of data production, the demand for data storage is increasing. Considering the limitations of current mediums, an alternative method for data storage has been proposed: storing data in DNA which is more cost and space efficient. Binary data is encoded into nucleotide bases. However, DNA, when exposed to stress factors deforms, leading to lost or altered data in DNA; thus, methods to ensure the stability of DNA are critical to implementing DNA data storage. We hypothesized that forming Transcription Factor A Mitochondria (TFAM)-DNA complex in an aqueous solution supports DNA stability during data storage and retrieval. TFAM preserves DNA inside the mitochondria, acting as an adequate stabilizer. The TFAM-DNA complex was created with replicated human lung cDNA and purified TFAM protein. This complex was able to maintain stability in conditions with various stress factors, suggesting that DNA can be a viable method to store data.

Among all physiological factors, low sperm quality is considered as the major cause. Currently, sperm quality can be examined through hospital appointments&#65292;which are time-consuming and may place psychological burden on patients, adding additional challenge to tackling the issue of reproductive health. Therefore, our team has proposed a novel diagnostic method to test sperm quality for household use. Our chip-based product is designed to measure sperm motility and fertility simultaneously, and present results in a visual way. We believe our home-use sperm quality test chip could contribute to self-examination and large-scale preliminary disease screening of sperm quality, increasing the medical attendance rate of reproductive diseases. Perhaps the hardest part of solving reproductive health dilemma is to confront it directly. We hope our product will be the first step.

https://teams.igem.org/4309	Environment	Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a class of semi-volatile organic compound that is abundant in the environment. Ligninolytic enzymes such as laccases and lignin peroxidases are potential biological pathways for bioremediation of PAHs. However, there are few studies on the heterologous expression of ligninolytic enzymes in Escherichia coli to degrade PAHs. The present study investigated the oxidation of PAHs using laccase CotA from Bacillus subtilis and lignin peroxidase LipH8 from Phanerochaete chrysosporium. It was observed that recombinant CotA and LipH8 had significant oxidation effects on PAHs. Moreover, combined ligninolytic enzymes are a better candidate for the remediation of PAHs than a single ligninolytic enzyme. An arabinose-regulated suicide switch was built to induce suicide once the engineered bacteria were released from the environment for biosafety. Our work will allow the design of biocatalysts for ligninolytic enzyme engineering and provide new insight into the remediation of PAHs by combined ligninolytic enzymes.

The microalgae perceive this disconnection and can inform this by its fluorescence. This project will enable the application of gene modification into wastewater treatment by guaranteeing biosafety. In addition, focusing on co-culture, we made a bioreactor to purify wastewater and collect microalgae pellets for extraction of biomass, which will provide the net cost reduction of wastewater treatment.

These bacteria block water uptake from the plants xylem, causing the plant to die. Chemical pesticides are currently used, but there are detrimental effects to the environment and consumers. We aim to contribute to SDGs 15th goal of life on land by decreasing the usage of pesticides by providing a substitute: Modified Bombolitin Antimicrobial Peptide. The modified bombolitin peptide, with attached amino acids to increase hydrophobicity, is expressed through competent Escherichia coli cells. Gene cloning and overexpression of bombolitin was done. To test the efficiency of plant protection, in-vitro testing of the peptide on Ralstonia bacteria is applied. Additionally, peptides with similar properties to the bombolitin are also identified through biopanning, allowing for future improvements.

The project transforms a green microalgae in order to create a new food source, rich in iron to fight malnutrition problems like anemia. Biologically, our project consists of overexpressing THB1 in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. This protein binds to iron molecules and increases the irons bioavailability. To control and improve THB1 expression, our team worked on the development of insulator sequences compatible with the MoClo kit, the cloning tool we used for Chlamydomonas. These sequences isolate genes from their genomic context. Our THB1 transgene therefore includes an inducible promoter, the gypsy insulator sequence from Drosophila as well as the associated protein Su(Hw) essential to the insulator mechanism. Finally, the production of the GMO uses bioreactors as an alternative to polluting and soil-destroying methods of agriculture.
https://teams.igem.org/4317	High School	Oil spills have always been one of mankinds most environmentally damaging acts since the 19th century. However, traditional biodegradable oil absorbents are hardly ideal due to their low cost-efficiency and poor oil adsorption capacity. One promising alternative material is brown rot fungi-decomposed pine trees, which has extremely high hydrophobicity and oleophilicity due to its high lignin content. However, the decomposition process takes up to 10 years in nature, making the mass production of the material impractical. To tackle this problem, we used E. Coli and Bacillus Subtilis to mass produce 4 types of cellulose-degrading enzymes. Treating pine tree powder with these genetically modified organisms secreting enzymes of interest resulted in an increase of lignin content from 25~30% to 39~47% while also showing significant improvement in oil adsorption. Our novel approach speeded up the decomposition process to 12 weeks, providing the potential for mass production of promising alternative oil absorbent material.

In Ontario, Leamington alone is home to more greenhouse acreage than the entire United States. However, many factors influence yield of these crops, and growers can experience massive yield losses due to insect damage. To meet the demand for innovative strategies to control insect pests, we engineered Bacillus subtilis to inducibly express insect Cytotoxic (Cyt) proteins through an IPTG responsive promoter, Pgrac. When off, the modified B. subtilis behaves normally and may have a positive effect on plant growth. When on, the bacterial biofilm produces Cyt proteins, creating a pesticide barrier to any Dipteran insect larvae that may be present in the soil.

https://teams.igem.org/4328	Software & AI	Actinomyces can produce &#945;-glucosidase inhibitors and the anti-diabetic drug acarbose. To improve the production of acarbose, our project intends to develop a generalized modeling software, by adding constraints to the genome-wide metabolic model of actinomycetes and combining deep learning to predict model parameters, it provides a feasible solution for the reconstruction of Deep Learning-based Enzyme-Constrained Genome-scale Metabolic model (DL-ecGEM) for actinomycetes. The model can also be used for simulation experiments. Through that, some hotspot identification tools can be used to find directional transformation plans for cells. Combined with the transformation recommendations given by the software, the deep learning network will be updated and can re-predict the parameters in the model. Thus, the phenotypic changes in acarbose production can be observed through simulation. At the same time, the model parameters can be optimized based on experimental data to make the model more accurate.
https://teams.igem.org/4329	High School	Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) threats the food safety especially for home storage. The enterotoxins can be generated by S. aureus quorum sensing (QS) system related to several genes named accessory gene regulator (Agr). Only AgrC and AgrB encode channel proteins which can react with autoinducing peptide (AIP). To block the QS channels, we utilized protein proximity labeling technology by fusing TurboID with N-AgrD and AIP. The fused proteins will bring TurboID to the quorum sensing channels AGRC and AGRB which will further be blocked by protein biotinylation on multiple lysine residues. The automatic biotinylation happens when the engineered Escherichia coli itself can produce more biotin through its own metabolic pathways. We therefore increased the expression of dethiobiotin synthetase and biotin synthase and, at the same time, knock-out of biotin consumption gene named bifunctional ligase/repressor BirA by CRISPR-Cas9. Thus, purified TurboID-AIP can be used for protecting food and our health.
https://teams.igem.org/4330	High School	The reason we chose this topic is that we saw many shrimp and crab shells are wasted in our dining hall and kitchen. We believe that Chitosan oligosaccharide can do something valuable. After reading some articles, we decided to investigate the topic about converting into chitosan oligosaccharide since chitosan is insoluble in water, but chitosan oligosaccharide is soluble in water, and it maintain the value that chitosan brings. Shells will be converted into chitosan oligosaccharide. Our experiment will mainly focus on the last part of the progress. We use cell surface display to make our experiment result better. The work which changes chitosan to chitosan oligosaccharide works more efficient when it takes place on the cells surface. Chitosan oligosaccharide has a lot of values which is good for either human or animals and even plants. It can antioxidant, anti-tumor, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, make animal bones stronger and help the growth of roots.

https://teams.igem.org/4339	Manufacturing	Peripheral nerve injury has affected over 550,000 people worldwide in the last decade. Currently, the most common treatment option for severe nerve damage is a nerve graft, sacrificing healthy tissue from another part of the body. Our project aims to combine highly conductive reduced graphene oxide (rGO), with strong, biocompatible silk to produce a biocomposite, for use in insertable grafts, to increase the speed and extent of nerve regeneration. We will use E. coli to produce recombinant silk proteins, using domains derived from the major ampullate silk of multiple spider species. We use modelling to evaluate the ability of co-expression of amino acid-relevant tRNAs and import proteins to optimise silk protein synthesis. We also aim to investigate and address barriers faced by disabled people in STEM, by interviewing students and professionals regarding their past experiences in science and designing a pipette brace to increase its ease of use.
https://teams.igem.org/4341	Diagnostics	Many types of bacteria can lead to an infection and an overreaction to any infection may lead to devastating tissue damage and potential death. This extreme immune response is termed as sepsis and is associated with 1 in 5 deaths worldwide. Our solution is to use an engineered phage therapy that directly targets the infectant, after detection with a phage reporter assay. Phages are advantageous because they are bacteria specific, a phage can be used to target a specific bacteria. Once a blood sample is obtained, our library of engineered phage will carry a fluorescent gene that will result in fluorescent bacteria once the phage inserts in its DNA. Phage types that lead to fluorescence will be administered to the patient in the phage therapy step. Additionally, interactive exhibits were held at local museums to engage the community on synthetic biology and how it could be used to address sepsis.
https://teams.igem.org/4342	Foundational Advance	Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 is a bacterium capable of taking up DNA directly from the environment (eDNA). Despite its natural transformation capabilities, it is not widely-used as a chassis in synthetic biology. For our project, we developed a detection system capable of recognizing any eDNA featuring ADP1 as a chassis. ARROWE specifically focuses on detecting eDNA from Pseudogymnoascus destructans, a fungus that causes White Nose Syndrome in bats. This system works via homologous recombination, which occurs when P. destructans eDNA is detected, producing a fluorescent signal and yielding resistance to azidothymidine. We also constructed and tested ADP1 strains engineered to detect the nptII and blaTEM-1 antibiotic resistance genes to demonstrate other applications of our approach and characterize parameters affecting DNA detection. We hope ARROWE will draw attention to ADP1s potential and serve as a model for future ADP1-centric projects.
https://teams.igem.org/4347	Diagnostics	The Canadian Indigenous drinking water crisis has been an ongoing issue for decades affecting thousands of Indigenous Canadians. After meeting with representatives from the Queens Office of Indigenous Initiatives and the Chief of Tyendinaga, we learned that there isnt a reliable drinking water diagnostic that could be used by communities. LAMPogen aims to develop a point of care water pathogen detection and filtration device. We used an emerging nucleic acid amplification technique called Loop Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) to detect conserved 16s rRNA regions within pathogenic E. coli, Salmonella, Shigella and Campylobacter. We have optimized the reaction through the re-engineering the polymerase responsible for LAMP via mutagenesis and protien fusion. Our device consists of 3 attachable lids to a kettle component, one lid for LAMP, one for filtration and one for drinking. We have also devoted a great focus on educating the general public about the breadth of this issue.
https://teams.igem.org/4348	Food & Nutrition	Despite the effectiveness of cholesterol-lowering drugs such as statins, PCSK9 inhibitors, and others, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and hypercholesterolemia remain the worlds leading causes of mortality. Currently, there are limited approaches to preventing CVD caused by high cholesterol. To address this, we designed and validated a novel three-step metabolic pathway to metabolize cholesterol into coprostanol, a sterol that cannot be absorbed in the gut. We subsequently integrated this pathway in B. subtilis, to engineer a cholesterol-lowering probiotic able to prevent intestinal cholesterol absorption. The pathway consists of ismA, a hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase from the bacterium, E. coprostanoligenes, and two repurposed sterol-metabolizing enzymes from humans. We tested the functionality of this pathway through in vitro enzymatic assays and confirmed coprostanol formation. Altogether, we engineered and validated the necessary components for a cholesterol to coprostanol-converting B. subtilis probiotic bacterium as a novel cholesterol lowering probiotic aimed at preventing CVD.
https://teams.igem.org/4349	Village	Intestinal parasites are among the most prevalent infectious diseases in the world. According to the World Health Organization, the world has about 1,5 billion infected people. These neglected diseases severely affect children and adolescents from vulnerable social groups in Brazil. The current strategy to control infections is administering anthelmintic drugs to at-risk populations, especially school-age children. Although this recommendation efficiently reduces cases, it can lead to increased resistance of parasites to current therapeutic options. Additionally, the diseases leave behind intestinal damage that can intensify malnutrition scenarios. So, we propose a new treatment: ProChi, which consists of genetically engineered Lactobacillus acidophilus that produces and secretes chitinase, an enzyme that cleaves chitin - a polysaccharide in the cuticles and eggs of nematodes. Therefore, it can kill these parasites and promote a quicker reconstitution of the intestinal tissue, contributing to the re-establishment of the nutritional absorption compromised by the disease.
https://teams.igem.org/4351	High School	Diabetes affects millions of people across the globe. Current treatments for Type I diabetes are routine insulin injections or islet cell transplants. Our proposed project, Dia-Beatable, utilizes self-amplifying messenger RNA (sa-mRNA) to produce insulin. The self-replicating nature will allow for fewer injections over longer periods of time. The proposed RNA construct would be self-regulating as we have incorporated an insulin-binding RNA aptamer as a control mechanism. This creates a negative feedback loop where the RNA aptamer acts a switch that terminates the translation process when insulin levels are high. Dia-Beatable also has potential uses in veterinary care and could be used to treat diabetes in pets as well. We hope that with our proposed treatment, patients and caregivers can minimize the strenuous maintenance process required when dealing with Type I diabetes.
https://teams.igem.org/4359	Therapeutics	Poor specificity is a fundamental issue with contemporary cancer drug therapy, necessitating improved alternatives. We have conceptualized and developed Duonco, a dual nanovesicle drug delivery system to address breast cancer, a growing concern in our community. Duonco targets HER2 and CX3CR1, two cell surface markers over-expressed in HER2+ breast cancer. We bioengineered E. coli to produce two distinct outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) populations, to selectively deliver chemotherapeutic prodrugs and their cognate enzymes, respectively, into tumour cells. This system is developed such that it functions analogous to an AND gate, where the drug is only activated in cells that overexpress both markers, and remains inactivated or undelivered in normal cells. Using hypervesiculating strains of E. coli, we have generated OMVs expressing anti-HER2 or anti-CX3CR1 affinity proteins on their surface and characterized them. We propose that such an adaptable system has immense potential for cell-specific targeting as well as in personalized medicine.

https://teams.igem.org/4364	Environment	Latest research shows increased levels of 14 commonly used antibiotics in rivers across 72 countries on six continents. This finding is supported by reports from Patancheru (India) that indicate levels of the antibiotic ciprofloxacin a million times higher than usually found in treated urban sewage. In Europe, sediments from the Sava river reveal antibiotic levels 1,000 times higher than normally expected. The first step of our project is to potentially find an enzyme that degrades multiple kinds of antibiotics found in water sources. To do this we talked with field professionals as well as did our own research, in order to find applicable antibiotics which could become water pollutants, leading to high levels of antibiotic resistance. After selecting the best enzymes for our purpose, our second step will be expressing them in laboratory Escherichia coli cells, in order to modify them via directed evolution for optimal activity in wastewater environments.
https://teams.igem.org/4365	Therapeutics	Chronic wounds are wounds that cannot progress through the normal stages of healing. They represent a growing problem, especially amongst aging populations and affect millions of patients each year. Chronic wounds are susceptible to bacterial infections and treatment relies heavily on antibiotics. Because of this, antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains are on the rise, increasing patient morbidity and mortality. To combat resistant bacteria-infections, we have adopted phage therapy. Our team has developed a bioresponsive hydrogel wound dressing for the treatment of chronic wounds. The bioresponsive hydrogel releases bacteriophages upon stimulation of the gel by proteases produced by the infected wound. Moreover, we have created new genetic parts and screened signal peptides to transform yeast into an efficient biofactory for the secretion of human growth factors. Using the same principles as in our bioresponsive phage-hydrogel, the secreted growth factors are released and can help chronic wounds to overcome inflammation and aid in healing.
https://teams.igem.org/4367	Diagnostics	The parasitic worm disease Schistosomiasis currently affects 240 million people worldwide and causes tens of thousands deaths every year. The current methods of treatment and diagnostics are insufficient. Therefore we wanted to develop a point of care test for DNA detection, enabling fast diagnosis and more accurate treatment of infected individuals. We have designed two separate systems. The first one is a cell free system that uses a fusion of dCas9 and split TEV protease. When bound to the target sequence it activates and induces alpha-complementation that forms the tetramer beta-galactosidase, which produces a blue pigment for a visual readout. The second method uses DNA-binding zinc fingers bound to the membrane of a yeast cell. Upon binding to the target sequence, production of the purple pigment violacein is induced as well as production of mating factor alpha. This induces the same genes in nearby cells, thereby amplifying the visible readout.
https://teams.igem.org/4369	Manufacturing	The short lifetime of equipment and dependance on insecure and costly supply routes not only cause safety issues for researchers on remote expeditions, but are also accountable for high amounts of CO2-emissions. By combining the opportunities of 3D-printing with a newly designed bioink, consisting of nitrogen-fixing Azotobacter vinelandii, we aim to provide an independent and sustainable solution for manufacturing in remote places such as space. Through overexpression of the hydrogel-forming polymer alginate and introduction of a cellulose synthesizing system, our setup provides workers and researchers with a modifiable system to manufacture small tools and consumables of various qualities on demand. By connecting the cellulose synthetase to an optogenetically inducable system, any products can be independently hardened upon exposure to blue light, enabling the opportunity to react to diverse circumstances. This way, CosMIC provides a solution for science to expand further into the yet unknown areas of our universe.
https://teams.igem.org/4370	Climate Crisis	The carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) is the most common greenhouse gas that overheats our planet. Here we present the proof of concept for making prolific producers of antibiotics autotrophic chassis by implementing the Calvin cycle in <i>Streptomyces</i>. To turn these bacteria into autotrophs, we cloned GC-rich sequences encoding RubisCO (Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate Carboxylase Oxygenase) and PRK (Phosphoribulokinase), key genes for the Calvin cycle. We have developed new genetic tools for the integration of these genes into the <i>Streptomyces</i> genome. Furthermore, to obtain antibiotic production in the minimal medium and implement the Calvin cycle, we engineered genetic tools via the CRISPR-dCas9 system to switch off the expression of genes of interest. Finally, we compared various <i>Streptomyces</i> strains, their phenotypic characteristics, and genomes to determine the best chassis for this project and generate a STREPTObook. The CO2CURE project will enable faster, more affordable, and sustainable bioproduction of antibiotics and many other useful derivatives.
https://teams.igem.org/4371	Environment	We observed the damage of river ecosystems caused by algae bloom in Republic of Korea this year, and community members suffered from algae bloom, with the odor of rivers and microcystin detected in tap water and various crops. Therefore, we have devised ABC biofilter, which solves this problem while also considering bio safety. Because anammox bacteria are difficult to cultivate, we produce enzymes necessary for the anammox process through cell free system, produce the biofilter with that enzymes which convert NO2- and NH4+ into N2 and prevent eutrophication which is the main cause of algae bloom. Also, we use cell free system to produce Superoxide dismutase (SOD) which produce H2O2 that remove green algae. Through this, we will prevent the algae bloom and remove green algae to maintain a healthy ecosystem of rivers and help people around the world from being harmed by algae bloom.
https://teams.igem.org/4372	Environment	The growing presence of antibiotic resistance that spreads through manure (via cow dung) in agricultural fields is a pertinent issue in India. Tetracycline is one such heavily used antibiotic. Oxytetracycline is, in fact, called the gold standard treatment in veterinary practice. Thus, to degrade residual antibiotics at their source i.e in cow dung, we use small laccase from Streptomyces coelicolor. By overexpressing it using a double promoter system, OmpA signal peptides and site directed mutagenesis, we developed Tetonin-a small laccase with a greater efficiency of degrading tetracycline in the cow dung. With Tetonin, agricultural stakeholders now have a way to reduce the presence of residual antibiotics in the cow dung that is eventually used as manure.
https://teams.igem.org/4373	Conservation	More than 70% of crop species are pollinated by bees. However, beekeepers in Europe and other regions worldwide have been reporting severe colony losses over the past decades. Pesticides are suspected to be one of the main contributors. One example is glyphosate which has several sublethal effects on honey bees including weakening the immune system and a decrease in brood survival. For Beecilli, we designed a probiotic that heterogeneously expresses glyphosate-degrading enzymes. These proteins act on the C-P or C-N bonds of glyphosate breaking it down. By incorporating the foreign DNA into the chromosomal DNA, we provide a stable construct that does not require a constant selection pressure and thus simplifies potential real-life applications.
https://teams.igem.org/4374	High School	In this post-pandemic world, air quality is a term that has become familiar. Control of the air we breathe is now key to maintaining safe and clean spaces. The pandemic and all the social and environmental changes we are living in; droughts, wildfires, pollution, power shortage, lack of resources, and the need for more eco-friendly spaces have made us think. Our project's objective is to use plants as CO2 sensors. This requires the identification of promoter sequences highly and specifically induced by high CO2 concentrations. To develop our project first we study the different expression levels of several Arabidopsis thaliana CO2 inducible promoters under ambient and elevated CO2 conditions. As a proof of concept, we use the GFP reporter gene to measure the transcription level of each promoter using Nicotiana benthamiana transitory transformation.

Comparing to traditional chemical dye, our biological dye is more environmental-friendly and money-saving. The bacteria will produce the dye directly and die from high temperature after the whole procedure of dyeing is done, causing no waste and leftovers, and the bacteria we use is of lower cost than the more commonly used substrate-- tryptophan. The biological dye can be used in fields such as medicine, agricultural industry and textile industry. We hope that our product can be put into industrial production.
https://teams.igem.org/4377	Manufacturing	Protein-based materials are currently leading to promising applications in various fields. With the advent of biotechnology, diverse assembly approaches have been developed to further acquire biomaterials with desired functionalities. Self- assembled protein Ultrabithorax (Ubx) from Drosophila melanogaster has been investigated as building blocks to construct material attributing to its inherent biocompatibility and mechanical properties. However, current yielding of Ubx has not achieved satisfactory results due to stress response. The aim of our work was to develop a novel biomaterial by engineering the Ubx functional domain. We first identified Y167 and Y240 domains, dityrosine containing motifs contributing to the linkings forming self-assembly, and engineered them with mRFP afterwards to test its functions. It is concluded that Ubx has the potential to successfully incorporate diverse functional proteins for wide applications in various fields.
https://teams.igem.org/4378	WIKI	Plastic is a very useful material. However, plastic pollution has world-wide effects on our environment. At the same time, only 9% of all plastic ever made has been recycled. We need to develop better techniques for recycling and upcycling plastic in order to reverse the effects that plastic pollution has caused our environment. Therefore we decided to focus on degradation of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastics since it is one of the most abundant types of plastic, has the largest number of characterized enzymes (40) that can act on it, and its degradation is arguably the best studied of all the synthetic polymers. Our overarching goal was to build upon previous work surrounding plastic degradation, membrane transport and bacterial upcycling to develop an E. coli strain whole cell catalyst system with a fully integrated metabolic pathway that could degrade PET plastics and further turn them into the chemical protocatechuic acid (PCA).

https://teams.igem.org/4380	Environment	The NanoFind project aims to combat challenges regarding detection of newly recognised environmental pollutants - nanoplastics - the smallest fraction of plastic waste. Nanoplastics have already been found in water-based beverages and aquatic organisms. Current attempts to investigate nanoplastics rely on expensive optical equipment which is hardly applicable to the frequent monitoring of the abundance of plastic nanoparticles in the environment. The promising work of Rübsam and the colleagues (2017) inspired our project to focus on the binding affinities between specific peptides and plastic materials. To facilitate detection, we engineered two types of plastic-binding peptides that can either bind cellulose or produce a fluorescent signal as an easy-to-interpret result. Together, these molecules create a complex that captures and recognizes nanoplastic particles. This system enables lowering the cost of the detection process while maintaining high accuracy results. Therefore, efficient and frequent monitoring can be achieved in a more convenient way.
https://teams.igem.org/4381	Environment	USC iGEM proposes to harness the power of synthetic biology to create a biofilter that requires minimal upkeep cost after deployment while providing similar performance when compared against conventional chemical/mechanical filters for deployment into developing countries where the most serious EDCs population tend to occur. Our engineered biofilter is composed of three genetic modules: (1) a sensing module in which the human estrogen receptor protein is produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae, (2) a degrading module in which an estrogen degrading pathway from Novosphingobium tardaugens will be cloned into Escherichia coli, and (3) an inter-domain communication module between the sensing module and the degrading module mediated by chemical signals emitted from our engineered S. cerevisiae and received by our engineered E. coli. Additionally, our filter will be housed in a calcium alginate hydrogel that will allow easy deployment in wastewater streams and in situ detection and degradation.
https://teams.igem.org/4382	Environment	Crop residue left in agricultural fields after harvest is known as stubble. Farmers need to get rid of the stubble left in the field before they can sow again. One of the most common methods used by farmers in India to get rid of stubble is by burning them. Stubble-burning causes a lot of problems, including air pollution, respiratory health issues, loss of biodiversity, and depletion of soil fertility. Burning the lignocellulosic biomass also results in the loss of a potential renewable resource that can be converted into various beneficial products. Here we have genetically engineered bacteria that can synthesize and exude enzymes which decompose lignocellulosic biomass. Additionally, we have designed a method for extraction of vanillin from decomposed stubble, followed by its conversion into bioplastic. Our project fosters sustainable stubble management that can provide alternatives for two major environmental hazards: stubble burning and non-degradable plastic waste.
https://teams.igem.org/4383	Therapeutics	Engineered probiotics are the next-generation biotherapeutics that are edited to target specific diseases. However, there are no reasonable solutions to several problems, such as colonization failure, low population density, and irregular expression of exogenous genes in vivo. Therefore, we designed an engineered probiotic platform based on the sugar substitute erythritol in order to solve the problems mentioned above. We introduce erythritol breaking down gene clusters and providing an exclusive metabolic niche in probiotics. When supplemented with erythritol stably in the diet, engineered probiotics will increase population density and colonization time in the intestinal microbiome. In addition, we precisely characterized the promoter of ery operon model, building an erythritol-induced regulatory system. Except for the platform, we introduced an erythritol utilization pathway downstream to synthesize small therapeutical molecules such as pyrroloquinoline quinone and L-erythrulose, giving this platform more therapeutical functions.
https://teams.igem.org/4384	High School	The chemical commodity valerolactam is among a family of amides called lactams that are traditionally produced through petrochemical methods, which require intense energy and toxic environments. One of the end-products of valerolactam is nylon, which is heavily demanded every year. Taking note of the impact the petrochemical production methods of valerolactam has on the environment, we explore the biosynthesis of valerolactam as a green alternative. Switching to a biosynthetic production method of valerolactam allows an overall more sustainable manufacturing of its end-products. Molecular dynamic simulations are also carried out to improve the efficiency of existing enzymes. The precursor molecule to valerolactam, 5AVA, is synthesized by the cyanobacteria strain Synechococcus elongatus UTEX 2973 using carbon dioxide as the carbon source. The cyclization enzyme 5YSS then cyclizes 5AVA to valerolactam, and the protein NitR embedded on magnetic beads captures valerolactam molecules. The NitR-valerolactam complex is then isolated by applying a magnetic field.

The existing chemical degradation methods have problems such as high cost, complicated process, low recovery efficiency, and severe secondary pollution. In 2022&#65292;Jilin China team is trying to build a new type of engineered bacteria for the treatment of copper, lead and zinc ions, which integrates heavy metal ion sensing and adsorption. The specific promoter can effectively sense the presence of heavy metal ion, and then activate the downstream fused expression of the metal binding protein and outer membrane protein on the cell surface. And the expression is to achieve the purpose of adsorbing heavy metal ions. Combined with our practical design, our whole system is expected to solve the increasingly serious heavy metal ion pollution.
https://teams.igem.org/4386	Village	Oxybenzone is a naturally-occurring organic compound and a component of many sunscreens providing broad spectrum ultraviolet light absorption. However, recent research has linked oxybenzone to coral bleaching, a growing problem in marine ecosystems, as well as DNA damage in corals and endocrine disruption in humans. Additionally, current research has focused mostly on the adverse effects of oxybenzone and not detection, which is important for future research to fully assess its impact. The goal of our project is to design a microbial in situ oxybenzone sensor that can rapidly indicate levels of oxybenzone. As oxybenzone is a xenoestrogen, our project uses an intracellular estrogen receptor, which binds to oxybenzone and uses it as a transcription factor to express GFP. The end product is a portable and efficient oxybenzone sensor that will play a vital role in future of oxybenzone research and protection of the ocean environment.
https://teams.igem.org/4387	Therapeutics	Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) comprises conditions in which the lining of the gastro-intestinal tract is chronically inflamed leading to symptoms like diarrhea, abdominal pain, bloody stools and fatigue. The exact etiology of IBD is a topic of extensive research whereby first hints point towards a multifactorial pathogenesis. Current treatment options are systemic and aim at modulating the immune system causing severe side effects. We, the UZurich iGEM Team, want to tackle the lack of targeted treatment options by developing a new microbe based therapy: IBD NanoBiotics. We modified E. coli Nissle 1917 by introducing a genetic circuit that can produce and secrete anti tumor necrosis factor (TNF) nanobodies upon selective induction by nitric oxide (NO) at the inflammation site. Along with our laboratory research, we have developed a predictive mathematical model and dedicated ourselves to outreach and education with a special focus on IBD patients.
https://teams.igem.org/4388	Therapeutics	Over 55 million people worldwide are currently living with dementia, of which approximately 60-80% are Alzheimers disease (AD) patients. By 2050, this number will increase to nearly 155 million. The polyphenol pterostilbene is known to modulate one of the main hallmarks of AD by targeting the NLRP3/caspase-1 neuroinflammatory pathway. Currently, pterostilbene is purified from plants at concentrations too low for wide scale therapeutic use. Therefore, at Symemco Therapeutics we have engineered E. coli to improve the production of pterostilbene to be used in mild to moderate stage AD. By using four key enzymes involved in pterostilbene production: tyrosine ammonia-lyase from Rhodotorula glutinis, 4-coumarate:CoA ligase from Arabidopsis thaliana, stilbene synthase and resveratrol O-methyltransferase both from Vitis vinifera, we have created a system with the potential to produce pterostilbene at concentrations necessary for AD therapies. Thus, our improved pterostilbene production method has the capacity to help AD patients worldwide.
https://teams.igem.org/4390	Environment	Water quality is of growing concern in Ghana with about 60% of the water bodies being polluted and most are in critical condition. The main cause of this pollution is unregulated industrial activities such as poor plastic waste management and illegal mining. From this issue, we identified PET plastic and heavy metals as tangible aspects of water pollution that could be mitigated. We wanted to develop a way to safely process PET pollution and heavy metals away from local communities. Through a literature search, we identified target proteins to mitigate Ghanas water pollution issues  PET degrading PETases from Ideonella sakaiensis, and metal-binding metallothioneins from Mytilus edulis. From this, we created a cell-free biodegradation tool for PET pollution and a bioremediation device for sequestering heavy metals along with a cell-free biosensor to detect heavy metals (mercury, lead, cadmium and arsenic) to locate the acutely affected areas of heavy metal pollution.
https://teams.igem.org/4391	Foundational Advance	Research in biocomputation has gained tremendous relevance due to its versatility, sustainability, and superior performance. In this regard, neurons, entities that power thinking and learning, have a lot to offer. Neural networks have been shown to learn, adapt and perform complex computations similar to and even better than conventional systems. We have created neural chips using N2a and SH-SY5Y cell lines that can be trained, following Hebbian learning principle, to compute and make decisions. The working of the chip was demonstrated in the detection of three microbes - bacteria E. coli, S. typhimurium, and fungus Penicillium. We have designed a platform that contains three specific aptamers against the three microorganisms. There is an electrical impedance change when aptamers bind to their respective targets. This impedance change (in the form of electrical current) is relayed to the neural chip that identifies the microbes (out of the three) present in the sample.
https://teams.igem.org/4392	Food & Nutrition	12% of the worlds arable land is waterlogged frequently, leading to approximately 20% crop yield reduction. Global warming causes waterlogging to be even more unpredictable in its nature, making it troublesome to solve. Waterlogging is excessive accumulation of water in the plant rhizosphere, negatively affecting plant and soil health. In plants, waterlogged soil causes exaggerated stress responses, releasing harmful amounts of ethylene. Hydrazome is a biofertiliser containing an engineered nitrogen-fixing, plant growth-promoting soil bacterium. We will be introducing the acdS gene to break down ACC in the soil before it is taken up by the plant and converted to harmful ethylene. The acdS gene will be in effect only during waterlogging, when the hypoxic conditions of the soil activate our hypoxia-induced promoter. We will also be upregulating the production of exopolysaccharides to absorb water, nutrients, and promote soil aggregation. Hydrazome will aid crops throughout their life, with or without waterlogging.

Unfortunately, cultivating and processing cannabis is an unsustainable and resource-intensive process. Pinene Express makes use of bio-engineered yeast to produce the main cannabinoids and select terpenes found in the cannabis plant. Our project seeks to establish a competitive edge over existing practices for manufacturing cannabis-based molecules. We did this by using a pre-engineered strain with higher flux through the mevalonic acid pathway, designing an extraction method for the cannabinoids, and using modelling to identify further improvements in the production process. We hope that our work destigmatizes prescription cannabinoids and promotes a more efficient and greener alternative to cultivation.

In particular, its unique drag-and-drop system enables for consistent expression levels of a genetic element across different species. Unfortunately, the UBER system lacks varied-strength promoters, hindering the design of multi-gene cassettes. Thus, the expansion of this suite for multi-gene regulation requires a systematic search to yield candidates of varying promoter strengths. We demonstrate proof-of-concept of a large-scale, UBER promoter screen, alongside collection of computational data useful in modeling the role of these promoters in metabolic applications. Through iGEM@Berkeleys at-scale structure, over 70 students contributed by performing bacterial cloning or computational analyses during a dedicated training window. As undergraduate access to hands-on, project-driven synthetic and computational biology research is largely inaccessible, this training sprint exemplifies our organizations mission to equip students with skills in cloning and computation for their iGEM@Berkeley projects and beyond.
https://teams.igem.org/4395	Manufacturing	Mountaineering is a challenging journey. With the rising elevation, the insufficient oxygen level may lead to a series of syndromes, which is called high-altitude illness. Experienced mountaineers usually take Salidroside, the extracts of Rhodiola for preventing discomfort. However, unrestricted exploitation imperils the living of wild Rhodiola, which is currently listed as China national category-II protected plant. This year, we wish to achieve de novo synthesis of Salidroside in E.coli as an alternative to wild Rhodiola extracts in order to protect this precious plant. In order to avoid metabolic burden and toxicity of metabolic intermediate, we put forward the concept of modularized co-catalysis. Besides, we also conduct direct evolution using TADR system for improving the catalytic efficiency of different types of glycosyltransferases. With synthetic biology, we hope to make our contribution to biomanufacturing of Salidroside.

https://teams.igem.org/4397	Diagnostics	Alzheimers diseasea progressive neurological disorder that leads to brain atrophy and neuronal lossis the most common cause of dementia worldwide. It affects about 6.5 million people aged 65 or older in the United States alone. The condition is also notoriously difficult to diagnose early, especially before onset of clinical symptoms such as memory loss and cognitive decline. Addressing this gap, we have built a portable, plasmonic biosensor-based device using the self-assembly of gold nanoparticles (AuNP) that produce wavelength extinction shifts via a localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) signal. The LSPR chip, viewed under a UV/Vis Spectrometer, provides absorbance signals to confirm the detection of our peptides of interest. Compared to currently available diagnostic methods, our device has lower cost and detection time and improved sensitivity. As a result, our device would enable early detection of Alzheimer's disease, and the adoption of efficient management strategies, from lifestyle changes to symptomatic treatments.
https://teams.igem.org/4398	Manufacturing	Crocin is a carotenoid compound found in Crocus sativus - the most expensive spice in the world. It has been shown to exhibit antioxidant, neuroprotective, as well as antiproliferative properties in cancer cells. Saffron requires specific climate conditions to grow and thrive. Additionally, the yield of crocin via extraction from saffron is rather low and the process is costly and labor consuming. To overcome these issues, we have decided to build upon previous iGEM projects and focus on engineering the full crocin biosynthesis pathway in the unconventional yeast Rhodotorula toruloides.
https://teams.igem.org/4399	WIKI	With the property to eliminate free radicals, anthocyanins have become popular anti-aging natural products which can be used as edible colourants. However, traditional anthocyanin industry requires intensive farming that occupies a lot of arable land, relies on climates and seasons and is also inefficient and wasteful during anthocyanin extracting. In our project, a beta-estradiol induciable system was employed for expression of two transcription factors regulating anthocyanin biosynthesis from Scutellaria baicalensis. An anthocyanin synthesis pathway was constructed in carrot hairy roots and then the hairy roots were induced to produce anthocyanins with high stability, high effectiveness and less hazard. With the culturing of carrot hairy roots in vitro, a controllable way of anthocyanin production was developed. In the future, our project is committed to make anthocyanins into easily accessible food pigments so that anyone can delay people's aging processes.
https://teams.igem.org/4400	High School	Environmental pollution has always been a critical issue, our project focuses on one of the most widely used chemicals, bisphenol A. Since its advantages in industrial production, bisphenol A has been used in plenty of aspects of the industry. However, the majority of people have nearly no awareness of how BPA is harmful to our health. It is verified to be associated with a variety of diseases. Therefore, investigating a method to detect bisphenol A is crucial. Our detection method is based on displaying tyrosinase on the surface of E. coli, followed by adsorption onto a glassy-carbon electrode. In detail, BPA can be oxidized by tyrosinase and eventually produce an electric signal. By detecting this electric signal, the concentration of BPA can be obtained. Finally, in applications, the results show our detection method can provide a better solution for BPA detection in cost, accuracy, and simplification.
https://teams.igem.org/4401	High School	Lead is causing severe pollution. It has a negative impact on normal agricultural and forestry production, and crops contaminated by heavy metals can lead to diseases that threaten humans health. No obvious solution has yet been proposed. Our project is designed to solve this issue by extracting the PtoMYB46, sequence of genes that is proved to have the function of absorbing the lead ions in previous detection, and converting it into poplars genes. We firstly extracted genes from the poplars' DNA and amplified the target genes using PCR technique after the detection of its purity and concentration. The cloning vector and expressing vectors were constructed in the second step. Finally, we transferred the gene to the agrobacteria to infect the poplars' leaves. The transgenic poplar improved and perfected the function of absorbing lead ions in poplar. We use directed evolution to further perfect tne function of genes.
https://teams.igem.org/4402	Village	The number of people have insomnia keeps increasing for many reasons. Such as colossal workload or addiction to their electronic devices. Taking melatonin, a natural hormone produced in the pineal gland of our brains, will affect ones sleeping cycle. Our project aims to develop an environmental-friendly and natural way to synthesize melatonin. Melatonin can be found in plants. However, the yield is relatively small. What we try to improve is the yield. We first extract PtoCOMT gene, related to melatonin production, from the poplars' DNA, run gel electrophoresis to test its purity, and then amplify it using polymerase chain reaction. Afterward, we transformed our target gene into two different carriers for storage and expression and transferred them into E.coli. Finally, we changed extracted plasmid into agrobacteria to infect the poplars' leaves, over-expressing our target gene, therefore increasing productivity.we use directed evolution to further perfect tne function of genes.
https://teams.igem.org/4403	Manufacturing	In this project the Bio-Brussels team looked through many databases in order to find peptides related to biocalcification, examples were found in animals such as corals, sponges, and mollusks. 19 selected constructs were recombinantly introduced in a protein scaffold based on endospore appendages found in different Bacillus species. The functionalization of this scaffold caused a significant decrease in the concentration of free calcium ions, as shown by titration. This decrease could be attributed to 2 different constructs, independent of temperature and protein concentration. This, in combination with TEM images of the protein, introduces the belief that the working mechanism is nucleation based. The team additionally proved that the endospore appendages could be produced by Lactococcus lactis in order to increase safety in further applications.
https://teams.igem.org/4404	Climate Crisis	The extensive emission of carbon oxides by fossil fuel combustion leads to a rapidly increasing greenhouse effect. Biofuels are providing great potential for sustainable fuels as they are produced from cell material instead of fossil resources. However, these agricultural products compete with food production. Biofuel production utilising CO2 as substrate can contribute to a drastic reduction of greenhouse gases. The acetogenic Wood-Ljungdahl pathway of Clostridia utilises CO or Syngas (CO2, CO, H2) as metabolic substrate to produce the central intermediate Acetyl-CoA. Biofuel production by these bacteria failed in the past due to low yields of valuable products. To overcome this obstacle, we introduced metabolic pathway genes of the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway into a high yield butanol producing organism to generate high biofuel yields from industrial waste gas. Our work presents a sustainable approach for the production of biofuel which is usable for various combustion engines by expressing central metabolic pathway genes.
https://teams.igem.org/4405	High School	Obesity is a serious problem that can lead to several health consequences such as cardiovascular diseases, musculoskeletal disorders, and depression. Today, more than 2 billion people are suffering from overweight and obesity worldwide. Meanwhile, existing drug therapy such as Orlistat and Liraglutide has a series of side effects. Therefore, we try to find out an alternative way to treat obesity. Through research, we found that there is a relationship between obesity, microorganisms in the human intestine, and the intestines absorption. In our project, we aim to use synthetic biological ways to solve this problem. We engineered E.coli Nissle 1917 and plan to place it in patients intestines in the future . These E.coli with enhancing the ability of expression of long-chain fatty acid transporter protein and acetyl-CoA synthetase can intake fatty acid in the intestines, preventing FA to be absorbed by the intestine, therefore losing weight.

As a novel class of microbial feed additives, Clostridium tyrobutyricum has great development prospects. We wish to tackle the worsening issue while contributing to the reduction of antibiotic use. We improved the oxygen tolerance of C. tyrobutyricum during feed additive production and after emission into the environment, through heterologous expression of DNA protection proteins Dps together with pyruvate dehydrogenase AceE, to increase the yield of its additives and develop its application as an acid fertilizer used for the solutions for soil salinization. We wish our project could help reduce the overusing of antibiotics and meanwhile further to improve the soil salinization problems, achieving dual healing for gut and soil.
https://teams.igem.org/4408	WIKI	Global energy exhaustion has been a serious issue all over the world. Until now, the world has made many efforts on developing new energy sources and technologies, but many of refacing various problems, such as expensive raw materials and the inability of mass-production. Butyl butyrate is a new class of biofuels with high performance. We engineered Clostridium tyrobutyricum to produce both butyric acid and butanol at the same time, and esterify it to form butyl butyrate under the catalysis of lipase. The aldehyde alcohol dehydrogenase AdhE2 gene were introduced into C. tyrobutyricum to convert butyryl-CoA to butanol, and the expression of Thl and Hbd were also strengthened at the same time to improve the yield of butyryl-CoA. Using discarded shrimp and crab shells as a kind of nutrient source, the green production process of butyl butyrate from kitchen waste to biofuels is realized.
https://teams.igem.org/4409	WIKI	Breast cancer has become the most common cancer in the world with the highest mortality in female cancers in 2020. Early diagnosis of breast cancer and individualized optimization of treatment strategies can greatly improve survival. Our project offers a sensitive, cheap, noninvasive, and widely applicable alternative way of sensing circRNA biomarkers for breast cancer. Our detection tool combines a CRISPR-Cas12a technology with a cell-free system to identify two circRNA biomarkers, hsa_circ_0001785 and hsa_circ_0001982, for the diagnosis and prognosis of breast cancer patients, respectively. The detection is sensitive for minimally invasive samples like blood and can be further extended to other circRNA biomarkers with ease. We aim to reduce the mortality rate of devastating diseases by providing a convenient method to screen them early.
https://teams.igem.org/4410	WIKI	Colon cancer is a relatively common digestive tract malignant tumor with a high mortality rate and is one of the three major cancers in the world. The main idea of our project is to use the non-pathogenic bacteria E. Coli Nissle 1917 to produce L-arginine to boost colorectal cancer immunotherapy. To overcome the arginine inhibition mechanism, the ArgR gene was knocked out and the ArgJ gene was inserted. To ensure biosafety, we inserted the Lysin gene into our engineered EcN so that it would be lysed after the bacteria had done their work. The engineering bacterium EcN in the project is designed to use the metabolite ammonia of cancer cells as a substrate to continuously produce a large amount of L-arginine in tumors. Long-term stay in the tissue has great potential for the treatment of digestive system tumors.
https://teams.igem.org/4411	High School	CRISPR-Cas9 is the third-generation gene editing technology after the introduction of ZFN, TALENs, and other gene editing technologies. In just a few years, it has swept the world and become the most mainstream gene editing system today. As research progresses, CRISPR gene-editing technology carries an implied risk of off-target, the accidental editing of other genes in the genome with unpredictable consequences. In this project, the common tool plasmids in prokaryotic expression systems are transformed, and TSD and TIR elements that can be recognized by Casposons are added to achieve site-directed insertion, which is verified by sequencing. This technology can not only play a role in the study of disease treatment methods but also become an efficient tool for upstream gene cloning. Key Words: CRISPR-Cas9, TSD, TIR, gene cloning
https://teams.igem.org/4412	Therapeutics	Glioblastomas are fast-growing and aggressive tumors which can lead to an array of fatal symptoms. Their morphological features, including thread-like tendrils that mesh themselves within the brains tissue, make them almost impossible to surgically resect. Although current treatment plans include various surgical and chemical procedures, the prognosis for these treatments remains cumbersome. To address this issue, weve aimed genetically modify a second-generation lentivirus coupled with a CRISPR-Cas9 Exon containing-complex to target and reverse an in-frame deletion of the EGFR gene that results in the loss of the ability of the cell to properly regulate proliferation. Ultimately, this may lead to the development of cancerous cells within the brain. In addition, we troubleshooted and created a detailed user guide for an sgRNA prediction software created by GunnVistaPingry_US in 2020. By reintroducing these missing exons to the genome via our lentiviral vector, we hope to introduce a novel treatment for GBM.

However, due to the limitations of such factors as large area of skin graft, long treatment period and high price, it is not enough to meet the needs of patients. In recent years, the development of 3D biological printing has provided a new idea for skin transplantation and brought dawn to patients with skin diseases and skin related industries. In the process of preparing biological ink for 3D printing, materials with good printing adaptability and cell compatibility is the biggest bottleneck at present. As recombinant spider silk protein has low immunogenicity, good cell compatibility and physical crosslinking ability, we set to construct a composite gel based on spider silk bio-ink, and evaluate its potential as a new biomaterials for 3D artificial skin or other scaffold printing or as new wound dressings.
https://teams.igem.org/4414	Diagnostics	Prolonged exposure to mental stress is an important cause of the high incidence of depression and anxiety in academia. Though timely lifestyle intervention can reduce the risk of these mental diseases, early detection of chronic stress and monitoring stress levels remain difficult. Here we demonstrate a novel cell-based tattoo to detect the rising glucocorticoid level induced by chronic stress and respond with a visible output. We engineered a novel synthetic transcriptional factor that translocates from the cytosol into the nucleus upon glucocorticoid stimulation and initiates reporter gene transcription. We confirmed that the cells carrying this synthetic transcriptional factor and its reporter cassette could respond dose-dependently to glucocorticoid stimulation with either fluorescent or visible colorimetric signals. Our results demonstrate a novel cell-based strategy for monitoring the glucocorticoid levels associated with mental stress, which could help our peers to monitor their stress conditions and therefore assist them in producing better scientific discoveries.
https://teams.igem.org/4415	Therapeutics	onCAP is a novel, phage-based cancer gene therapy using adeno-associated virus phage (AAVP) vectors to treat B-cell lymphoma. We constructed our phage combining two modified fd-tet plasmids, fMCS and f3-55nm, as well as an expression cassette engineered from the pAAV plasmid to include granzyme B and TNF-&#945;. This plasmid encodes for a phage displaying anti-CD22 short chain variable fragment on its viral coat, which will lead to the release of the plasmid into mammalian cells. Upon plasmid release in human cancer cells, the proteins granzyme B and TNF-&#945; will be expressed to induce cell death. We hypothesize that an AAVP therapeutic will show high specificity for cancerous B cells with limited off-target effects, because our target marker is primarily expressed on B cells and AAVPs are generally well-tolerated by the immune system. Our goal is to create a proof-of-concept demonstrating the potential of phage therapy in targeting aggressive B-cell cancers.

https://teams.igem.org/4417	Climate Crisis	Climate change is the most pressing problem of our generation, causing ecosystem collapse. One of the main contributors that has escaped significant public scrutiny is the construction industry, which accounts for 40% of global CO2 emissions, with 8% due to production of cement. To produce cement, fossil fuelled furnaces heat limestone to 1400 ºC to produce various calcium oxides, releasing 600 kg of CO2 for every tonne of cement produced. To tackle this challenge, we engineered Bacillus subtilis to overexpress urease and carbonic anhydrase enzymes. These enzymes produce carbonate ions from atmospheric or waste stream CO2, which when exposed to free calcium form stratified formation of calcite crystals at the bacterial cell outer surface. The precipitated crystalline calcium carbonate acts as the binding agent within our material, giving it properties comparable to concrete. Using engineered B. subtilis we produced a drop-in replacement of traditional cement to decarbonise this critical industry.
https://teams.igem.org/4418	Food & Nutrition	Phosphorus is an essential element that makes up the backbone of life in DNA, cell membranes and ATP. Application to soil as phosphate fertilizer drives plant photosynthesis and growth, but the mines that keep the world fed are set to run out, threatening to drive up already unaffordable fertilizer prices. Simultaneously, current use is inefficient as phosphate is lost as runoff and organic waste, eutrophicating waterways and threatening ecosystems and human health. We have developed Pho-Bac, a strain of bacteria Bacillus subtilis, successfully engineered to release phosphate in response to the plant phosphate stress signal malate, thereby acting as an ecologically sensitive biofertilizer. We also attempted to couple release with luxury phosphate uptake, giving Pho-Bac the potential to capture and recycle wastewater phosphate, curbing nutrient pollution and supplying crops with sustainable and locally-sourced phosphate fertilizer, creating a circular phosphate bioeconomy.

https://teams.igem.org/4421	Therapeutics	Cancer immunotherapies rely on one or few specific tumour-associated antigens. However, the adaptive immune system relies on a large and diverse repertoire of antibodies for antigen recognition. Here we proposed the development of libraries of genetically modified NK92 cells displaying diverse repertoires of chimaeric antigen receptors (CARs) that can recognize non-self antigens and display antigen-dependent clonal expansion, with the expanded population of tumour-specific effector cells to exert antitumour responses. In vitro experiments and mathematical models were used to prove the applicability and feasibility of synthetically generated CAR libraries. This work is similar to the game of Whack-a-Mole, where moles always pop up elsewhere (resistance cancer cell clones show up constantly based on traditional therapy); while we can use a giant hammer (synthetic cell library) to strike all the moles simultaneously.
https://teams.igem.org/4422	Food & Nutrition	Mexico has enormous agricultural biodiversity, producing and exporting various vegetables, fruits, and grains. However, several pests attack Mexican crops impacting the sustain of families in rural communities, the economy, and the country´s food supply. In particular, the order Coleoptera presents critical pests in native crops. Some of these pests are the avocado, agave, and cactus weevil, which damages their host plant. Sadly, these are only three of the numerous affected Mexican crops. Therefore, our team designed a biopesticide using a holistic perspective capable of efficient coleopteran control. This cell-free product is based on two spider venom peptides as their active ingredients, AcTx-Hv2 and OAIP-1. These peptides have a high selectivity to Coleoptera order and dont impact human health. We used Pichia pastoris to produce these peptides taking advantage of its capability to express complex molecules in high yields.
https://teams.igem.org/4423	Climate Crisis	According to the 2019 IEA Global Status Report, the production of building materials causes 11% of global CO2 emissions. Using synthetic biology to create alternative building materials may be the solution. Our goal is the creation of an alternative brick material with help of two microorganisms. The cyanobacterium Synecchocystis PCC 6803 has the ability to take CO2 from the air, converting it to CaCO3. Meanwhile the yeast, Komagataella Phaffii (a.k.a. Pichia Pastoris), expresses polymers such as gelatin, spider silk and PHB. These polymers cross-link with the carbonate, giving our bricks structure. The brick also includes considerations of a circular economy, as our material includes sand, lignin, and construction waste to explore their effect on the material. We created our plasmids via Golden Gate Assembly, focusing on expression cassettes in both yeast and cyanobacteria. In silico and in stakeholder meetings, we consider up-scaling approaches for future implementation.

Our state, Jalisco, is accountable for half of these exports, employing more than 500,000 people. However, fungal pests have been causing up to 40% of losses in harvests because of the difficulties to identify them at an early stage. We designed BerryVax, a preventive and corrective biocontrol solution with a self-manageable system. In it, we propose to genetically modify Bacillus subtilis to overexpress surfactin, activating the plants defense system while improving water absorption and fruit quality. Furthermore, the bacteria will be able to produce chitinase to degrade the fungal wall as a corrective measure when fusaric acid (produced by pathogenic Fusarium oxysporum) is present, ensuring that the corrective mode will be activated only when needed. BerryVax, innovating in Mexican agriculture one berry at a time.
https://teams.igem.org/4425	Village	We produce tyrian purple dye in E.coli by 3 enzymes: Trp 6-halogenase (Trp 6-Hal), tryptophanase (TnaA) and monooxygenase (MO). Due to TnaA can react with both tryptophan and the first step product bromotryptophan, Fre-SttH and TnaA has to be in two different strains. So the two-cell system, &#916;TnaA E. coli strain without endogenous TnaA expression and another &#916;TnaA E. coli strain with extra TnaA expression, are used to produce tyrian purple with less byproduct indigo. We optimize to one-cell system by developing a synthetic phylogeny of programmable Trp repressor with directed evolution to simplify the process of reacting with bromotryptophan not tryptophan. Iterative rounds of positive and negative compartmentalized partnered replication (CPR) led to the exponential amplification of variants that responded with high affinity and specificity to halogenated tryptophan analogs and novel operator sites. We empower cells to perceive the relative ratio of bromotryptophan to tryptophan to control TnaA synthesis.

https://teams.igem.org/4428	Environment	According to UNICEF, a third of the worlds children are affected by lead poisoning, a challenge that may even prove to be fatal. Exposure to lead can be via contaminated air, water, food, and consumer products, which makes assessment and monitoring of lead contamination extremely crucial. We comprehensively solve this problem by addressing two needs - detection and recovery. At the low lead concentrations found in groundwater or even wastewater, current recovery methods are inefficient and uneconomical. We perform a comparative study on multiple lead-binding proteins - PbrR, its metal-binding domain and PbrR691 - by expressing them on the surface of Escherichia coli to develop a bacterial biosorbant for lead recovery with the highest degree of cell-surface display, affinity to lead and specificity. Lead, highly recyclable, can be desorbed from the surface for further use, generating value. We are also developing an oscillatory frequency-based whole-cell biosensor for efficient lead detection.

Despite its devastating effects, no true therapeutic exists against it yet. We used synthetic biology and antibody engineering to address the issue, taking care of the problem of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), a pitfall that often causes dengue antibody therapeutics to fail. We designed an engineered antibody fragment that checks all boxes of an ideal therapeutic against Dengue: pan-neutralizing, potent, does not cause ADE, has adequate half-life and is cheap. Our in-silico molecular dynamics simulations helped us probe the ideal geometry, stability and functionality of the drug. In the lab, we further characterized its properties and established an optimal production system using the SHuffle strain of E. coli. Since Dengue is a major issue in India, we made sure to reach out to all possible stakeholders in this endeavor. Their inputs shaped our approach immensely.

Therefore, its early-stage detection is critical for timely intervention needed to save the patients life. Here we propose a system for more accurate and cost-effective detection of cancer by taking advantage of biomarker sensing together with external electron transfer through a microbial fuel cell. As the final output, we will detect an electrical signal in the presence of a cancer biomarker. Our project relies on the use of a toehold switch biosensor to detect the cancer biomarker PANTR1, a long non-coding RNA, and subsequently express a gene that leads to an electron flow outside the cell resulting in an electric signal. To detect this electric current, we built a microbial fuel cell device connected to an Arduino chip that allows real-time electron transfer measurements with an accuracy higher than fluorescent molecules or chromophores commonly used in such devices.

There is currently a gap in early detection of neurodegeneration related to mTBIs. By using our biosensor in the future, a quick, non-invasive first screening can be done to understand the severeness of the diseases. AptaTear could change the way we detect neurodegenerative diseases as we use tears as our samples rather than spinal fluid. We hope that this would one day reduce the risk of developing a neurodegenerative disease with high severeness and allow patients to maintain most of their life quality.
https://teams.igem.org/4434	Diagnostics	Cervical Cancer, despite being one of the most preventable cancers if detected in early stages, is still the fourth-most common cause of death from cancer in women. Prevention of Cervical Cancer is very dependent on early detection of the Human Papillomavirus, which virtually causes 100% of the cases. This can be attributed to the lack of a national HPV screening programme and public awareness in rural areas. Available tests are also reliant on expensive equipment that requires trained personnel to results. Detection of the HPV using a simple-and-rapid method is extremely important to take appropriate action against cervical cancer, particularly in areas where healthcare is inaccessible.

Different acidophilic bacteria, such as Komagataeibacter spp, naturally produce BC, however, high production costs hamper its widespread utilization. To minimize BC production costs, the Unicamp_Brazil team created the Cellulopolis project, which used genomic-scale metabolic model for cellulose production optimization from FBA simulations; these results indicated a set of key genes which lead to BC production increase. The group developed and optimized a toolkit and a methodology for engineering K. rhaeticus AF1 wild-type strain, allowing a light-inducible BC production circuit design. Furthermore, we constructed a low-cost two-step bioreactor for culture growth and BC production destinated for countless applications, such as tissue culture scaffolds. With this project, we aim to unveil new horizons in the BC production fields, enabling cost reduction and a new toolkit for Komagataeibacter engineering.

To combat this issue, we have designed a nitrate-capture system utilizing curli proteins, which are self-assembling amyloid fibers secreted by E. coli that will form a mesh-like structure upon secretion. Our goal is to fuse the nitrate-capturing protein native to cyanobacteria, nrtA, to the curli monomeric unit, csgA. This fusion will be done with the SpyTag/SpyCatcher system, a two-part system that, upon contact, spontaneously forms an isopeptide bond. We are planning our capture system to be a cell-free mesh that can be encapsulated and placed near waterways in agricultural communities. However, we eventually want to modify our construct into a cellular system under the control of an inducible promoter that produces nitrate-capturing curli only in the presence of nitrate.

Of all food products, fruits and vegetables have the highest wastage rates, making up 45% of total waste. To tackle this, Cellucoat designed a preservative bacterial cellulose (BC) packaging which can extend the shelf life of fruit and replace current plastic packaging. Our BC is functionalized with antimicrobial properties through recombinant expression of a food safe and antimicrobial peptide called nisin. Since Canada is banning the use of single-use plastics, we are expressing recombinant polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), a bioplastic, to strengthen our packaging. For cost-effective production and homogeneous distribution of antimicrobial and strengthening properties, our BC packaging is developed through a coculture between Escherichia coli and Komagataeibacter xylinus. Cellucoat aims to deliver a sustainable antimicrobial packaging to help prolong the shelf life of produce.

Keeping in mind the low concentration of miRNAs in the blood samples, an amplification technique has also been incorporated into the kit. Once detected, the various combinations of biomarkers would give us a fluorescent readout, which can be used for further treatment.

https://teams.igem.org/4440	Manufacturing	Open space is a hostile environment, where one of the threats for living organisms is harmful radiation. If we dream to terraform other planets, we need to find efficient ways to mitigate these hazards. Our well-being depends on other living organisms, therefore, we must find ways to adapt these organisms to the space environment. Our team is focusing on making budding yeast resistant to space radiation. We are engineering yeast to produce melanin, a known chemical that protects cells from both UV and ionizing radiation. To achieve this, we are expressing exogenous tyrosinase from Bacillus megaterium. To mitigate potential cytotoxic effects of melanin precursors, we are also aiming to isolate tyrosinase in viral-like nano compartments and alternatively to attach tyrosinase to the outer cell wall. The latter strategy would coat yeast with melanin. These yeasts could be used in spaceships and even other planets to produce valuable compounds for humans.
https://teams.igem.org/4441	Diagnostics	There are nearly 100,000 cases of melanoma in the United States (US) each year. When diagnosed early, 98% of melanoma patients survive. However, in the US 9,000 people each year die from the disease. Early detection of melanoma is very important as early detection can drastically increase treatment efficacy and thus survivability. We have worked on developing a paper-based point of care (POC) diagnostic test for early detection of melanoma. Additionally, we have also designed peptide-based anti-cancer therapeutics for treating advanced stage melanoma.
https://teams.igem.org/4442	Village	Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a mood disorder that includes symptoms like persistent sadness, and lack of motivation. Currently, diagnosis for MDD includes the DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria, however, there is a need for a risk assessment tool to complement this. Cross-sectional studies show significant differences in the gut microbiota composition between healthy individuals and MDD patients. Of particular interest are the dysregulated bacterial metabolites butyrate, GABA, butyrate, and indole, which have profound effects on the development and progression of MDD, and have a distinct metabolic signature that can be used to profile individuals as having a greater risk for MDD. As such, our team designed a two-cell consortium tri-input biosensor that can assess the levels of each metabolite independently, while also using logic gates to predict overall risk for MDD. Mathematical models of the biosensor were used to validate our system further and identify the systems sensitivity to baseline concentrations.
https://teams.igem.org/4443	Therapeutics	Hospital acquired fungal infections are a global health issue (Rayens & Norris, 2022). Specifically, hospitalizations occurring due to COVID-19 make nosocomial infections of Candida albicans a major threat (Sang et al., 2021). Here, we describe a synthetic sense and respond system; Claymore which can autonomously detect and destroy C.albicans. A C. albicans secretion is used to induce transcription of our gene circuit for the production of Bacillomycin D (BMD). Production and secretion of this cyclic lipopeptide destroys C.albicans through deleterious membrane interactions. Currently we have isolated, domesticated, and assembled our gene circuit components using Gibson cloning. We have also been able to assemble these fragments, using Golden Gate cloning, into a backbone with a GFP construct. To determine circuit functionality, future experiments will consist of induced gene circuit expression for GFP fluorescence followed by BMD production, secretion, and C. albicans destruction.
https://teams.igem.org/4444	Foundational Advance	Intercellular communication is primarily studied using synthetic protein-level circuits. These circuits currently lack the spatial and temporal control necessary for targeted and time-sensitive applications. To address this gap, we developed Photocrete, a toolbox of protein constructs for light-inducible control of protein display, secretion, and shedding. We expanded upon RELEASE (Vlahos et al.), a modular and generalizable protein circuit which utilizes an ER retention motif and an exogenous protease to control protein secretion. We optogenetically modified RELEASE by replacing different components with the photocleavable protein PhoCl, allowing us to control the mammalian secretion pathway at distinct nodes with finely-tuned light administration regimens. Preliminary results indicate integration of Photocrete into the secretion pathway, but more research is necessary to determine optimal light administration settings. The potential for high spatial and temporal control of Photocrete could allow researchers to perform various signaling studies and develop therapeutics at a new level of precision.

https://teams.igem.org/4446	Therapeutics	Alzheimers disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease. In this two-year project, the NCSU iGEM team will be developing a biotherapeutic to delay the onset of AD. By engineering the bacterium Clostridium butyricum, to secrete butyrate, we achieve neuroprotection by reducing- 1. oxidative stress on the brain, 2. neuronal apoptosis and 3. neuroinflammation. Engineering is accomplished using a two-plasmid induced CRISPR/Cas9 system and will be delivered using C. butyricum spores to the gut. Elevated butyrate enters the bloodstream and crosses the blood brain barrier, through the gut-brain axis. Using quantum computing, we have identified the appropriate time for the therapeutic to be administered and the most suitable metabolic pathway. Recognizing potential concerns regarding genetically engineered organisms, we authored a neuroethical report and designed a CRISPR kill switch for containment. Through outreach projects, we designed an AD caregiver app and used their feedback to shape our overall project.
https://teams.igem.org/4447	Village	Water scarcity is a major constraint to socio-economic development. Therefore, research has been focused to evaluate water quality through the measurement of different contaminants. Among them, the presence of emerging contaminants (ECs), principally micropollutants, such as pesticides, pharmaceuticals, and hormones are an important matter due to the negative impact its presence could have on aquatic life, the ecosystem and human health. In order to effectively monitor and determine ECs, there is a need to create fast, responsive analytical procedures. Nowadays, major approaches include liquid or gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy. Thus, with the purpose of building a sensible kit to ECs able to measure concentrations in the magnitude of nanoMolar, an enzymatic system was developed to detect the presence of erythromycin, rifampicin and pentachlorophenol present in a variety of water bodies in Jalisco, Mexico.

https://teams.igem.org/4449	Village	Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) are the third most prevalent bacterial infection in India and the second most diagnosed infectious disease worldwide. Urinary Tract Infections often, asymptomatic, complicate into sepsis, benign prostatic hyperplasia and chronic infections affecting organs of the Urinary Tract, like the kidneys. Chronic UTI leads to frequent recurrences, antibiotic resistance, and kidney infections. Current diagnosis methods include antibody-based testing which requires technical expertise, laboratory conditions and cold chains. This is a time consuming procedure and has limited availability at the point of care. We aim to develop a diagnostic kit with a multiplex aptamer-based solution to detect uropathogenic bacteria at the point-of-care. This will provide a multifactorial advantage that provides rapid, novel, cost-effective and precise results without the application of refrigerated infrastructures, which is beneficial for economically weaker sections of the demography.
https://teams.igem.org/4450	Therapeutics	Deep space exploration requires careful resource and capacity management. Manufacture is limited. Based on previously published literature, bacterial cellulose (BC) produced by K.xylinus can be functionalized with chitin by using genes from C.albicans. Thus, we decided to expand on the idea by using bioinformatic analysis to identify and clone homologous genes from S.cerevisiae that should produce a similar end product with broader applications. We propose to make space travel sustainable by using degraded organic waste for the bacteria to synthesize this co-polymer. The process is light independent and space efficient. This new BC could be used as a biodegradable polymer with pharmaceutical and biotechnological applications, as well as an additional source of food. Space Exploration has long inspired scientists to come up with solutions that have uses on Earth, like solar cells, LEDs, etc. The biomanufacturing of our modified BC could also be a means for sustainable waste management.
https://teams.igem.org/4451	Foundational Advance	Naturally-occurring proteins are often repurposed by synthetic biologists for a wide range of applications, but the performance of these genes typically leaves much to be desired. With rational protein engineering only possible for well-studied genes, directed evolution provides an attractive alternative for real-world optimization. Unfortunately, the labor and time-intensive nature of this approach makes it impractical for smaller labs. To make this technology more widely accessible, we developed rEvolver  a kit for continuous, in vivo directed evolution. At the heart of this kit is a modular plasmid system for both targeted mutagenesis using polymerase-guided base editors and continuous growth-rate-based selection. Complementing the plasmid system is an inexpensive, open-source turbidostat designed to reduce the labor-cost of long-running directed evolution experiments. Finally, to further accelerate evolution, our parts and media have been optimized for use with Vibrio natriegens, a novel chassis organism with a doubling time of less than 10 minutes.
https://teams.igem.org/4452	Food & Nutrition	With rising interest in resuming spaceflight, plant growth in space is crucial for manned missions as they provide food, oxygen, and atmospheric regulation. Resource scarcity and sustainability is crucial in space, and the cost of sending food to the International Space Station is high. Plants grown in space are unfortunately smaller than their Earth counterparts since gravitropic cues responsible for guiding root growth are absent. Stunted root growth in turn, translates to reduced plant size and diminished caloric value for astronauts. We aim to engineer roots to grow directionally in gradient magnetic fields - magnetotropism. Filling statoliths with iron-loading proteins like ferritin will allow statoliths to move in response to a gradient magnetic field, and this field will be generated using a pair of Helmholtz coils. This method of engineering hardware and root cells to generate and respond to magnetic cues can advance astrobiology and enhance nutritional outcomes for astronauts.

https://teams.igem.org/4455	Environment	People in Arizona still struggle to access clean water due to a history of scarcity and mining contamination. 19% of the drinking wells sampled in Arizona exceed the maximum arsenic level established by the US EPA, threatening the health of those who rely on these water sources. In response, ASU iGEM created Chlamydomon[As], an engineered microalgae capable of bioremediating arsenic from contaminated water. We're enhancing an existing arsenic uptake pathway in C.reinhardtii by introducing arsenate reductase (ACR2p) and phytochelatin synthase (PCS) genes into the C.reinhardtii nucleus. ACR2p reduces incoming arsenic into arsenite, and PCS enhances the cell's ability to bind and sequester arsenite in the vacuole. Multicistronic transgene expression was achieved by developing a tricistronic vector separated by viral 2A peptides that allow independent gene expression under the control of a single promoter. Chlamydomon[As] has the potential to revolutionize bioremediation technologies to solve the issue of arsenic contamination in water.

Therefore, finding more accessible alternative early cancer detection methods is a top priority. One current method is through the detection of cancerous miRNA in plasma, however, this comes with significant barriers such as high cost related to miRNA sequencing. To address these problems, this project focuses on developing E. coli bacteria that contain conditionally active guide RNA (gRNA) and CRISPR Cas12a aimed at detecting cancerous mRNA in plasma samples. These modified bacteria have the potential to be accessible at any standard diagnostic laboratory, and expected to be cheaper than current equipment.

Current methods of detecting and degrading PCBs are either environmentally harmful or expensive. We are developing safe-to-use and accessible methods of detection and degradation of PCBs based on projects from the Stockholm-2020 and Chalmers-Gottenberg-2019 teams. We are genetically engineering both Rhodococcus to enhance its natural ability to degrade PCBs and using yeast to produce bioluminescence when in the presence of PCBs. We contacted the PCB division of the EPA for advice on how we could implement our project. Additionally, we reached out to professors in Maryland who worked on developing a technique to deliver PCB-degrading microbes to contaminated bodies of water. To inform the public about our work, we collaborated with other teams to educate people through classes and social media. Our system, conscious of previous work and health concerns, can mitigate the threat of PCBs.

However, current detection methods require sophisticated pre-treatment and instrumentation, significantly limiting usage scenarios and increasing detection costs. Our team is therefore motivated to develop a fast, easy-operative solution for portable nitrite determination. Discovering the dissimilatory nitrite reduction pathway within E.coil, we genetically engineered BL21 to overexpress nitrite reductase NrfA to detect nitrite concentration more efficiently in the water, food, and plasma samples. With the E. coli being coated on a paper-based biosensor, electrons produced from nitrite reduction are transferred into an electrical signal and transformed to nitrite concentration after data preprocessing. The result will be shown to every customer, accompanying an evaluation of the sample's safety. Harnessing the power of nature, we lead a step toward a more intelligent, proactive, and environmentally friendly lifestyle.

RDX has shown adverse effects to humans, flora, and fauna, thus posing a risk to the Vieques ecosystem and its inhabitants. We propose a biosensing, cell-signaling module inducible by presence of RDX and coupled to a biodegradation module via the quorum-sensing signal molecule, AHL. We identified two possible biosensing elements in previous works: a transcriptional fusion of two promoters from nitric oxide (NO) detoxification-associated genes, and a synthetic aptamer riboswitch with high affinity for RDX. For the biodegradation module, we identified a P450 cytochrome and reductase duo, XplA/XplB, isolated from bacterial isolates with RDX-degrading capabilities. Unfortunately, we were unable to complete the wetlab work due to an unanticipated meteorological event that left the island without power. We hereby demonstrate our proof of concept and future works ahead.

Halocarbons which include CFCs, HCFCs, and HFCs, serve more than 80% of our current refrigerant needs. Contrary to their role in cooling, halocarbons are one of the leading causes of global warming, in addition to ozone depletion. As we are shifting slowly towards greener cooling technologies, we are rendering tons and tons of halocarbons obsolete every year. If left untreated, their emissions can destroy the ecosystem in no time. IISc-Bengaluru aims to develop a sustainable system that can process halocarbons on a large scale.

Recently, an enzyme was discovered in bacteria that breaks down PET and following this, several studies have used the wild-type protein to improve its efficiency and stability for enzymatic degradation in vitro. Although these recent achievements are incredible advances, having optimized PETases for conditions that microbes prefer will essentially make PET biodegradable. To produce PETases that function under different conditions (e.g. fermentation), our team is building a platform for producing PETases through continuous directed evolution called OrthoRep. To achieve this, weve developed a system that selects for yeast mutants with improved activity in user-defined conditions.

Recently, antifungal peptides have been shown to be promising and powerful candidates due to their specificity and efficacy. In alignment with this current research, we employed bioinformatic approaches to scour the highly understudied fungi genome databases and published literature to identify two potential fungal targets, PstSCR1 and Pst_12806, known to be involved in the fungal pathogenesis. After locating known binding partners found naturally in plants, SERK3B and TaISP, respectively, we aimed to design and measure the binding affinity of our predicted peptide sequences as potential antifungal treatments.

A significant portion of these deaths is due to the increasing frequency of harmful algae blooms in recent years, caused by excess fertilizer runoff into bodies of water. Harmful algae blooms cover the surfaces of bodies of water they pollute, diminishing light penetration and depleting seagrass, the manatee's primary source of food. A recent paper elucidated mechanisms by which the fungal toxin cercosporin can preferentially inactivates cyanobacteria responsible for blooms. Cercosporin acts via permeation of lipid membranes and the production of reactive oxygen species in the presence of sunlight. We inserted the beginning steps of the biosynthetic pathway for cercosporin production into S. Cerevisiae. The goal envisioned by this year's team is to increase product yield, leading the way for biosynthetic mass production serving as an emergency treatment during algal blooms.

However, current directed evolution protocols rely on random mutagenesis, consuming disproportionate amounts of time and resources. CARPE, computationally-aided rapid protein engineering, is a faster and more resource-efficient alternative to directed evolution. Using computationally proposed mutations to the active site of the Ste2 GPCR in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we engineered Ste2 to recognize the kidney disease biomarker Cystatin-C instead of its native ligand. Evolutionary relationships were explored through pairwise alignments to identify binding residues with high Shannon entropy in Ste2. These target residues were computationally mutated to evolutionarily related amino acids to determine sets of mutations that optimized binding energy to Cystatin-C. To validate results, computationally-favorable mutations were induced in Saccharomyces cerevisiae upstream of mVenus to assess binding affinity between CARPE-mutated Ste2 and Cystatin-C.

This is because the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB), a lining of endothelial cells on the artery, prevents drugs from accessing neurons. We deliver beneficial proteins to neurons by fusing them with HIRMAb (Human Insulin Receptor Monoclonal Antibody), a biological trojan horse. NT-3 (Neurotrophin 3) and FGF-2 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2) are fused to HIRMAb via PCR cloning and Gibson assembly. HIRMAb binds to the insulin receptor on endothelial cells, and through receptor-mediated transcytosis, delivers NT-3/FGF-2 across the BBB. NT-3 or FGF-2 then binds to its respective receptor. We developed a transwell assay to test that our fusion proteins cross the BBB and an interaction assay to determine their interaction with their receptor. Our research demonstrates a relevant mechanism for crossing the BBB and can be adapted to other neurodegenerative diseases.

This transition can bring about uncomfortable, sometimes debilitating symptoms. Within the gut microbiome are bacteria that produce products such as equol, an isoflavandiol that mimics estrogen in the body. Equol has been shown to be an effective treatment to relieve menopause symptoms however, the monthly cost for the necessary dosage is unreasonably expensive. Additionally, gut microbiomes vary from individual to individual so not all individuals are able to naturally produce equol at effective rates. As the median age of women increases across the globe, issues which arise during menopause become more prevalent. To combat this issue, we sought to improve the rate at which Adlercreutzia equolifasciens and other gut microbial species produce equol. Demonstrated feasibility of these engineered organisms can then be utilized for future use in probiotic supplements as an affordable menopause treatment.

CBD is known to have relaxing and anti-inflammatory effects. CBD is extracted from hemp. The methods of extraction are complicated and costly. Therefore, CBD infused products are expensive. Our main goal is to produce CBD efficiently via Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The production of CBD requires two substances. These substances are, geranylgeranyl-PP(GPP) and olivetolic acid (OA). During the production of GPP, two rate-limiting enzymes are present. Therefore, by overexpressing these enzymes, we expect an increase in the production yield. OA should be added to the culture medium to produce CBD. However, OA is expensive. Therefore, we thought of producing OA in S. cerevisiae. We believe that this method of CBD production can be cost and yield effective. Therefore, making CBD infused products more affordable for consumers.
https://teams.igem.org/4488	Foundational Advance	Nanobodies are epitope-binding fragments from camelid heavy-chain antibodies. They possess antigen-binding qualities typical of whole antibodies but are smaller, more robust, with lowered immunogenicity. Hence, nanobodies are frequently used in medical and research applications like tumour-targeting therapies and ELISA assays. However, nanobody technologies are limited by the requirement of live animal hosts for development and the extensive research time for producing new nanobodies in response to rapidly mutating or diverse antigens (e.g. SARS-CoV2). Our project proposes using synthetic biology for novel nanobody discovery in vitro through DNA-shuffling. This method uses homologous recombination to generate extensive mutant nanobody gene libraries which are screened for useful affinities or specificities using an E.coli surface display system passaged over target antigens immobilised on cellulose via cellulose-binding domains. This removes animals from the development process, allowing for faster, ethical nanobody deployment, for use in technologies like lateral-flow tests to detect emerging coronavirus variants.

https://teams.igem.org/4491	Foundational Advance	Variability in biology is a significant challenge when designing systems reliant on consistent protein expression levels. It presents a particular problem in fields such as metabolic engineering, where fluxes through pathways must be tightly controlled; or microbial drug delivery, where consistent levels of drug release would be required. To counter this inherent variability, we are using control theory to create a set of standardised integral controllers, tailored for different protein expression levels, to reduce steady state error. Using a combinatorial approach, we are designing, testing and modelling a variety of circuits, to build a user-friendly robust adaptation platform. Our system will allow simple one step cloning of the gene of interest into the circuit, and choice of circuit with a desired output level and feedback properties. This allows for wide application, as any protein of interest can be easily inserted into the circuit and held at a reference production level.

Microalgae can be used to produce biofuels while consuming harmful environmental agents, such as carbon dioxide and wastewater. Our goal is to create a synthetic biology system that will increase lipid production from microalgae to serve as an intermediate in chemical reactions needed to create biofuels. Specifically, we will create a co-culture between C. minutissima microalgae and E. coli to increase the cell density of C. minutissima. To increase C. minutissimas growth rate, E. coli will be genetically modified to produce indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). C. minutissima will be genetically modified to express glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT), lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase (LPAAT), and diglyceride acyltransferase (DGAT) to increase lipid production. We hypothesize that these factors will create a dense algae population with high lipid content, providing ideal parameters for biofuel production.

Their wide distribution and high concentrations in the environment amount to a time bomb for public health. However, conventional heavy metal testing methods have their current problems such as low cost-efficacy, low efficiency, non-environmental-friendliness, etc. We, Team DKU_China, aim to tackle this challenge by propelling the development of a rising new method for pollution detection: synthetic biological whole-cell biosensors. Our project is focused on the detection of copper in water to set an example and facilitate future research on the detection of other heavy metals. To achieve our goal, we created a biosensor with improved accuracy and sensitivity using high-throughput technologies, compared to traditional methods. We hope our efforts can help whole-cell biosensors become more widely accepted and applied in heavy metal detection. We envision a future with a world cleaner and greener than ever

Our project concerns the utilization of Leukine Rich Repeat (LRR) domain containing proteins for plant pathogen diagnosis and specifically tospoviruses. We will acquire the LRR domain of Sw-5b resistance gene of Solanum Peruvianum and surface display it on e. coli (DH10b) cells.

In Brazil, most ophidic accidents are caused by snakes of the Bothrops genus. This study aims the heterologous expression of Bj46a, which act as an inhibitor of the hemorrhagic metalloprotease jararhagin. The goal of this study is the evaluation of the efficacy of recombinant inhibitor in first aid application in order to reduce the damage caused by the eventual delay in the conventional treatment by B. jararaca antiophidic serum.

Personalized medicine, which allows therapies to be adapted to individual patients, provides promising attempts for fighting cancer diseases. A well known approach is Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy. However, this emerging treatment is limited by its specificity, with off-tumor responses causing severe side-effects in patients. With our approach  SpecifiCAR  we aim to improve specificity of CAR T-cell therapy utilizing distinctive factors of the tumor microenvironment. Our project involves targeting of acidic pH and CD8+ cell clustering around solid tumors. We are using modern tools of the synbio toolbox to introduce an inducible loop facilitating quorum sensing of CAR T-cells. Furthermore, we explored the possibility of a pH control mechanism for CAR activation. To help facilitate future projects involving CARs we have developed a software tool to streamline the design of the receptors.

Unfortunately, substantial obstacles block their implementation as therapeutic agents. The ability to produce high amounts of designer EVs and a standard and specific purification methodology are still lacking. Here, we present a biological system to produce designer exosomes based on HEK293T cell line. Firstly, we have included a tag system to improve and simplify the collection and purification techniques. Furthermore, we have implemented a molecular device based on L7Ae:C/D-box interaction that permits the direct loading of shRNA-labelled molecules into exosomes inside the cell, avoiding the cumbersome process of artificial loading.

According to a survey, one billion people worldwide are suffering from fungal skin diseases today. Therefore, finding an innovative and efficient way to treat fungal skin diseases is urgent. To kill the fungi on the skin, we intend to degrade the chitin in the fungal cell wall by using chitinase to destroy its structure. However, most common chitinases on the market have only one degradation domain and thus have a weak binding ability. In this case, they cannot work efficiently. To solve this problem, our team used synthetic biology to bind chitinase binding domains extracted from two bacteria to the N and C ends of our chitinase, respectively, to obtain modified chitinase with strong binding ability.
https://teams.igem.org/4503	Village	Eutrophication is caused by microorganisms in water bodies thriving on excess nitrate levels. Nitrates can make their way into water bodies due to fertilizer use in agriculture or industrial activity. This creates an unpleasant smell and look and blocks sunlight from reaching marine life inside the water, killing plants and leading to the destruction of marine life. The foul smell can avert tourists, which can devastate small businesses that rely on seasonal income. This is why we are designing a filter to convert the nitrates into an indigestible form of nitrogen that cant be utilized by these microbes, stopping eutrophication. We will achieve this by expressing the gene responsible for the production of nitrate reductase in E. coli, and harvesting the enzymes. They will then be immobilized on a 3 layer water filter which can be installed in water drainage systems. We offer a solution to the problem of eutrophication.

We plan on developing a biological system with longer life, by genetically engineering E. Coli biofilm with suffused phosphate enzyme to eradicate heavy metals from industrial effluents. Substrates added in the moving bed biofilm reactor would dephosphorylate the phosphate monomers into free phosphates and alcohol. These compounds form complexes with heavy metals and sediment them. Our approach for this process will be on a laboratory scale with a small-scale prototype reactor. The method is cost-efficient when compared to other wastewater treatments. We aim to establish a healthy and happy ecosystem with mutual development between industries and mankind.
https://teams.igem.org/4510	Climate Crisis	Cyanobacteria has the capability to produce hydrocarbons such as alkane, which could be utilized in jet fuel. One existing problem is that long chain alkanes tend to precipitate due to hydrophobic interactions. A possible solution to this is HEFA-SPK (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids-Synthetic Paraffin Kerosene), a commonly used drop in. The HEFA-SPK pathway requires free fatty acids to be converted into alkane and eventually branched alkanes through hydrotreatment. By this hydrotreatment, alkane isoforms with more branches would be generated reducing the hydrophobic interactions. The enzymes aldehyde deformylating oxygenase (ADO) and acyl-ACP reductase (AAR) in cyanobacteria have been confirmed to be responsible for catalyzing the production of hydrocarbon. In order to optimize the expression of the two enzymes, expressions of other less important enzymes are inhibited, while overexpressing the forementioned two enzymes with the help of plasmid transformation. This could bypass the first step of HEFA pathway, thereby optimizing production.
https://teams.igem.org/4511	High School	Enhancing gene expression is vital for downstream applications such as biosynthesis of valuable chemicals or manipulating behaviors of designed gene circuits against intrinsic noise. The traditional means is to adopt promoters with higher activity to increase the inflow of mRNA and protein translation, which inevitably increases metabolic pressure for the chassis, thus limiting the scale and complexity of artificial biological circuits. Instead of increasing gene expression, we seek to modulate the degradation rate of mRNA by degradation-tuning RNAs (dsRNAs) on the 5UTR region of the mRNAs, which function by promoting or inhibiting the attack from endogenous RNases. It allows us to enhance protein expressions without posting an extra metabolic burden to the host, and we introduce these functional structures on mRNA to synthetic biology as a new type of standard biological parts.

Pteris Vittata, also known as the Chinese Brake Fern, is an arsenic hyperaccumulator that absorbs arsenic from the soil and transfers it from root to shoot for sequestration in vacuoles. Our model consists of three critical enzymes: PvARC2, PvPHT1;3, and PvACR3. Arsenic, when in the form of arsenate, travels through PvPHT1;3, which is a phosphate transporter in the cell membrane, into the cytosol of the cell. After that, PvACR2, a reductase in the cytosol, reduces the arsenate to arsenite; PvACR3, an antiporter, then induces arsenic sequestration in the vacuoles. By modeling this arsenic sequestering mechanism, our goal is to provide a solution for arsenic contamination in the environment.

However, new antibiotics require decade(s) of research and development. Therefore, our goal is to develop an antimicrobial platform that is highly programmable for targeting emerging threats or new antibiotic resistant mutants. Our therapeutic platform, SynPhage, has two-levels of programmability. The first is genetic programmability to target AR or virulence genes using CRISPR-Cas. The second level is to control which bacteria receive CRISPR-Cas by engineering T7 transducing particles to display a nanobody selective for pathogenic bacterial receptors on the tail fiber complex using a sortase (SrtA) mediated post-translational functionalization strategy. This post translational attachment allows for proper folding of the tail fiber complex prior to nanobody attachment, as AlphaFold modeling predicts complex misfolding for direct protein fusions. Overall our new synthetic biological system serves as a foundation for modular therapeutics against AR.

To test our ideas, we are working with a Brazilian bacterium, isolated from the soil of Olinda in the 1960s, Streptomyces olindensis, to obtain in large quantity a drug candidate called Cosmomycin D, with great bactericidal and also antitumor activity. Our project aims to expand the use of Streptomyces as a platform for future metabolic engineering projects, and to contribute to developing new strategies to combat antimicrobial resistance and cancer.

To tackle this challenge, we have developed an innovative and sustainable approach using engineered Bacillus subtilis. Our bacteria possess five functional modules that enable them to replicate, adhere, break down, and detect PET in the environment. In addition, we have integrated a suicide switch to regulate the bacteria population and guarantee biosafety. Our project aims to address the issue of plastic pollution and safeguard our planet.
https://teams.igem.org/4592	Bioremediation	Harmful algal blooms (HABs) are increasing in prevalence due to warming temperatures; this threatens the utility and biodiversity of freshwater ecosystems globally. The cyanobacteria Microcystis aeruginosa secretes microcystin, a hepatotoxin that is the principal contributor to this threat. Remediation of HABs can be accomplished with synthetic biology, but efficiently transforming M. aeruginosa is difficult due to targeting of foreign DNA by restriction-modification systems. We used the Stealth program to identify underrepresented R-M motifs in the M. aeruginosa genome and developed our Chameleon project to remove motifs from CDSs via synonymous codon-optimization of a broad host range plasmid (pSPDY). The resulting change in transformation efficiency will be assessed to validate the programs. These experiments will establish a method for preparing plasmids for efficient transformation into M. aeruginosa, which we will leverage for future toxin disruption. Beyond the M. aeruginosa context, this project will provide a foundation for engineering other non-model species.
https://teams.igem.org/4593	High School	Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is a common pathogen that often cause skin infections and food poisoning. Recent research has shown that the human digestive tract is its long-ignored reservoir. Our project develops an efficient and convenient detection and elimination kit for S. aureus. Detection is accomplished by heterogeneous application of the S. aureus quorum sensing (QS) pathway. Autoinducer peptides (AIPs) in the pathway act as intercellular communication molecules and activate the P2 promoter, further inducing E. coli lysis through endolysin SPN1S_Lys RZ, releasing S. aureus-specific Endolysin ClyC, LysDZ25, LysGH15, and antimicrobial peptide (AMP) LL-37 to achieve elimination. We employed the ssDNA aptamer PA#2/8 to detect environmental contamination, which binds to Protein A, a unique membrane protein of S. aureus. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and Enzyme-Linked Oligonucleotide Assay (ELONA) are used to confirm the successful formation of the binding complex and select the optimal version of the aptamer.
https://teams.igem.org/4594	Climate Crisis	Imagine a living light bulb that can glow in the dark and use sunlight as its energy source. That's what ShanghaiTech-China iGEM team have created this year. We transferred the luxCDABEFG gene into Synechococcus elongatus, a cyanobacterium that performs photosynthesis. At the same time, we use fusion protein technology and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) technology to enable it to emit more intense light in the fully visible spectrum. By doing so, we enabled Synechococcus to emit light using the carbon source products of photosynthesis. At the same time, we used the intrinsic rhythm system of Synechococcus to control its luminescence, so that it can switch on and off according to the day-night cycle. It is hoped that this novel organism can become a carbon-free green lighting system in the future, with applications in biotechnology, environmental engineering and art.
https://teams.igem.org/4595	Climate Crisis	Global warming and the greenhouse effect have emerged as critical and urgent climate crises. One of the key drivers of those issues is the emission of CO2. Among the various contributing factors, the excessive combustion of fossil fuels in industrial facilities stands out as a primary source of CO2 emissions, accounting for approximately one third of the total, which directs our attention to thermal power plants. To relieve the current situation, we HUST-China propose a new strategy. Our approach involves the collaboration between engineered cyanobacteria and Shewanella to concurrently capture CO2 and produce electricity, with the ultimate goal of reducing CO2 emissions and diminishing the need for fossil fuel combustion.
https://teams.igem.org/4596	Bioremediation	In recent years, indoor formaldehyde pollution, a known human carcinogen, has increased in newly renovated homes, with existing removal methods facing issues like secondary pollution and inconsistent effectiveness. To address the pressing issue of formaldehyde pollution, our team has developed an innovative biological device. We've integrated genetically modified bacteria into this device to remove formaldehyde from the environment oxidatively. These bacteria express non-natural cofactor (NCD)-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase and formate dehydrogenase. To ensure their efficient function, we've introduced the NCD synthase system to alleviate competition for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). Additionally, we've incorporated a modified malic enzyme into the pathway to maintain the amount of NCD, enabling stable operation of the formaldehyde metabolic pathway. This comprehensive solution offers an effective and safe approach to combat formaldehyde pollution.
https://teams.igem.org/4597	Food & Nutrition	Project BloomBiota aimed to create a probiotic containing enriched B12 and human gastric intrinsic factor (hGIF) to combat vitamin B12 deficiency, which disproportionately affects women, vegetarians, and the elderly. Through one pill containing the probiotic strain of Escherichia coli Nissle 1917, an individual receives a B12 supplement and increased absorption. BloomBiota is novel because it aims to express hGIF in the bacterial periplasm instead of the cytoplasm, which increases the chances for proper folding, resulting in a functional protein. Ultimately, the project's goal was not achieved. However, several new parts were contributed to the registry and an impressive and affordable model of a probiotic pill-packing machine was created. When attempting to transform E. coli Nissle 1917 with a BAC containing the B12 cluster and the plasmid containing hGIF, it would be advisable to use CRISPR to remove the pre-existing plasmids, allowing facilitated uptake of the large, engineered BAC.
https://teams.igem.org/4598	Therapeutics	We are developing an E. coli Nissile 1917 (EcN) based therapeutic to selectively target and destroy GI tract pathogens. It is a precise, modular, alternative to small-molecule antibiotics. Our first target is Helicobacter pylori, a stomach pathogen infecting more than 50% of humans. We bind to surface proteins present on our target and conjugate a malicious DNA payload into our target cell. We've engineered our strain to survive in the stomach by upregulating the glutamate-dependent acid resistance using GadE (BBa_K1639002). We are also expressing a biofilm with functionalized curli monomers to further enhance acid fitness. Conjugation occurs using a modified RP4 "helper" plasmid that doesn't transmit itself, allowing us to safely transfer a separate plasmid coding for our payload without transmitting conjugation machinery. Our team also developed EZBinder, a one-click binder design software that creates high-quality protein-protein binders without requiring previous experience with computer science or protein design.
https://teams.igem.org/4599	High School	Our team is redesigning a chromoprotein to a biosensor platform. The colour-changing chromoprotein switches colours upon binding to a target ligand. The biosensor design is based on work done by Stewart Loh's lab and the 2013 Uppsala iGEM team. The designed biosensor has the potential to detect a variety of ligands, our focus is on creating a biosensor to detect one of the most serious health problems of captive marine fish. Velvet disease is caused by Amyloodinium dinoflagellate parasites. The parasite enters the slime coat of a host fish and damages the host's cells. Fish farmers and pet owners would benefit from having a rapid test that is able to detect parasite levels early. The biosensor will be engineered to change colour upon binding to a target protein produced by the parasite. The user-friendly lateral flow assay will not require any specialized equipment and have a long shelf life.
https://teams.igem.org/4600	Biomanufacturing	Limonene and perillyl alcohol (PA) are naturally occurring chemical compounds with applications in the food, cosmetic, and cleaning industries. More notably, perillyl alcohol in particular, has shown very promising results in clinical testing as an anticancer drug treating carcinomas, and tumours and acting as a chemoprotectant for skin. With the demand already increasing year by year, these potential implementations will only increase the need for limonene/PA. Because conventional extraction is inefficient and energy-expensive, biomanufacturing seems like the obvious route. However, due to bottlenecks arising from the antimicrobial effects of limonene and PA (as well as other precursors), synthesising the compounds intracellularly isnt at a point where it is utilised on an industrial scale. Our project proposes a two-pronged approach: one using a feedback system to downregulate enzymes involved in PA production and the other using a pump - both will mitigate the toxic effects of our products to increase production.
https://teams.igem.org/4601	Therapeutics	Imagine a world without sight - a harsh reality for many. The retina, a specialized tissue at the back of the eye, houses photoreceptor cells, each containing opsin molecules that respond to light, a crucial element in vision. The loss of these cells leads to the depletion of opsins, resulting in blindness. OptoGenEYEsis is a pioneering tool that leverages light-sensitive microbial opsins for genetic therapy. Our aim is to rejuvenate the retina's light-sensing abilities and restore vision. Unlike other microbial opsin-based treatments which suffer from narrow absorption spectra, suboptimal sensitivity, and limited efficiency in converting light into nervous electrical signals, our approach uses synthetic biology and microfluidics-based directed evolution for enhanced opsins. This innovative approach promises improved light absorption, heightened sensitivity, and efficient conversion of light into electrical signals for visual processing. It's more than just a solution; it's a game-changer in the fight against blindness.
https://teams.igem.org/4602	Therapeutics	Sexually transmitted infections (STIs)is a serious public health issue worldwide: an alarming incidence (1M new infections/day), prevalence (80% of sexually active individuals acquire human HPV by 45) and disease burden (82,000 deaths/year from hepatitis B). Our iGEM team aimed at solutions by understanding the needs and constraints for a sustainable solution from all stakeholders (public health, NGOs, patients). Lubritect leverages the power of naturally occurring lubricant, mucin, and the generative power of AI, to inform a product that is safe, effective and easy to handle. We combine a mucin-based hydrogel, shown to reduce transmission rates of HIV and HSV with AI-generated protein structures designed through RF-diffusion, to bind to surface proteins and catch target pathogens. This approach potentially circumvents the evolution of pathogenic escape mechanisms by using protein structures not found in nature. We hope to generate a personal lubricant product which can entrap pathogens, significantly reducing their transmissibility.

https://teams.igem.org/4604	Foundational Advance	Phenotypic instability in microbial cultures severely limits the applicability of synthetic biology. Be it for plastic degradation or vitamin synthesis, persistent gene expression is a must. Therefore, we have created CELLECT, an innovative autoregulatory system that makes microbial survival dependent on the existence of a target molecule. The system integrates a riboswitch, specific to the target compound, linked to a toxin-antitoxin mechanism that regulates cell survival. The binding of the target molecule to the riboswitch inhibits downstream toxin gene expression, allowing the cell to persist. Conversely, in the absence of the target compound, toxin levels steadily increase, resulting in cell death. CELLECT's versatile design makes it applicable across diverse host organisms for the optimization of microbial production or degradation of any compound. We employed computational models to predict system performance in laboratory experiments and demonstrated its functionality through the continuous bioproduction of vitamin B12 in E. coli.
https://teams.igem.org/4605	Biomanufacturing	In today's fast fashion industry, an astonishing 100 billion new garments are manufactured worldwide annually. Unfortunately, the process of dyeing clothing with lipophilic dyes like indigoidine stands out as the most detrimental environmental factor within production cycle. Rainboweaver endeavors to present a truly innovative solution. Building upon previous iGEM research, firstly, we optimized K.xylinus cultivation for bacterial cellulose and created a metabolic pathway in C. glutamicum for indigoidine production. Secondly, we proposed two approaches: 1) Establishing a co-cultivation system. To ensure color uniformity, we explored agitated cultivation of indigoidine-producing C. glutamicum with BC-producing K.xylinus or directly using BC as a scaffold for C. glutamicum cultivation. 2) Introducing enzymes associated with indigoidine metabolism into K.xylinus for direct synthesis of colored fibers. Providing a groundbreaking solution to address pollution in the fashion industry, our project represents a paradigm shift by integrating cellulose production and dye synthesis into a single system.
https://teams.igem.org/4606	High School	Osteoarthiritis and Obesity are two major health problems prevalent in our society nowadays. Obesity increases the risk of OA in both weight-bearing (knee) and non-weight-bearing (hand) joints, and obesity doubles the lifetime risk of OA. An efficient new therapeutic target for osteoarthritis related obesity is of urgent need. Adipose tissue can secrete more exosomes in the obese condition, which have been reported to play an important role in inter-organ communication and regulate the functions of joints. Micro-RNA, a small non-coding RNA, is an important component of exosomes that function as guide molecules in RNA silencing. Our project utilizes TargetScan software and luciferase reporter plasmid to validate its target gene in the obese exosomal micro-RNA. The inhibition of the highly expressed adipocyte exosomal micro-RNA can greatly reduce its harm on the joint and be an ideal way for anti-Obesity and joint guardian.

Conventional antibiotic treatment exacerbates the issue by fostering bacterial resistance. We pioneer non-antibiotic bovine mastitis treatment, addressing global needs while minimizing risks. Aureobos, is an intramammary infusion of endolysins, antimicrobial enzymes known for their specificity, effectiveness against antibiotic-resistant strains, and limited development of resistance. To overcome challenges such as gram-negative bacterias structure, short endolysin lifespan, and limited range, we synthesized three recombinant-endolysins: LysCSA13, LysK, and LysSS. They feature natural catalytic (CHAP) and cell wall binding (SH3) domains, a 30 hour-lifespan extension via an albumin binding domain, and enhanced targeting and lysis capabilities against Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus uberis (SH3B30 domain), Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli (polycationic peptides PCNP and CecA). Finally, we included a TEV cleavage site for 6x HisTag removal after protein purification.
https://teams.igem.org/4608	Therapeutics	Prevalence of cancer has been on the rise in the last twenty years, with cancers like pancreatic cancer still not improving in terms of treatment options. We engineered a novel, personalized therapeutic technique. A personalized treatment modality restricts negative off-target effects, ideally killing cancerous cells before surgical resection becomes the only viable treatment. We utilize the newly discovered CRISPR system, Craspase, to engineer forced pyroptotic cell death among cancerous cells. Craspase is a CRISPR RNA-guided, RNA activated protease, which mediates our personalized therapeutic approach. Our team takes advantage of the high homogeneity of KRAS mutations in pancreatic cancer to design a genetic-level therapeutic that targets the cancer at its root, rather than targeting hallmarks of cancer. We designed modular parts for our project in hopes of engineering a novel therapeutic for many different manifestations of cancer, and perhaps more generally any disease propagating through RNA.

Our iGEM project addresses this by engineering E. coli into lens solutions, creating a DMBT1 protein system to inhibit Pseudomonas growth, reducing infection risks. This system comprises a toxin-antitoxin system, population sensing system for bacterial growth control, and an Hsp27 self-inducing system for increased protein production. These systems were experimentally validated and optimized through mathematical models. Additionally, we developed a multifunctional smart lens case that monitors solution properties in real-time, enhancing user safety and compatibility with specific solutions. This project provides an innovative, feasible, safe solution to improve lens wearer safety and comfort, lower infection risks, and contributes significantly to synthetic biology and eye health care, integrating engineering, biology, and mathematical modeling.
https://teams.igem.org/4610	High School	Parasites of freshwater salmonids exert significant economic damages to the aquaculture industry, being associated with an annual cost of some $1.05 billion to $9.58 billion (Shinn et al, 2015). Notwithstanding this economic impact, these parasites are unable to cause notable disease in humans, and are often overlooked in the broader effort to develop antiparasitic diagnostics and therapeutics. The salmon industry, being the fastest-growing means of food production worldwide, is particularly impacted by parasitic infection (Iversen et al, 2020). We aim to produce an antiparasitic natural product within fish by delivering to them a series of genes packaged in environmentally-degradable chitosan nanoparticles. The antiparasitic compound being considered is fumagillin, which has demonstrated activity against the parasitic species Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae, nucleospora salmonis, loma salmonae, and myxobolus cerebralis. We seek to reconstitute the fumagillin pathway by administering antiparasitic gene therapy to affected fish by delivering genes through the nanoparticles in fish feed.

OTA is a toxic mycotoxin widely present in wine, posing health risks. By using specific binding and amplification techniques, the detection module enables convenient OTA detection. The degradation module utilizes probiotics to create a functional polymer network with the OTA-degrading enzyme M-CPA, effectively converting OTA into non-toxic compounds. Overcoming challenges like wine's pH and alcohol content, this project ensures safe and efficient OTA degradation in wine. We offers a novel approach for sensing, tracking, and reduction of ochratoxin A, which holds significant importance for wine safety.

Our project comprises three phases. First, quorum sensing expressed the SulA gene, elongating bacterial monomers via filamentation. Next, Spytag was positioned on flagellar L-rings using FlgH, while SpyCatcher was displayed via Wza. Spytag was captured by SpyCatcher, cross-linking bacterial cells into a regular 3D network structure. Finally, by surface-displaying silaffin and adding TEOS, bacterial cells underwent siliconization from the outside to the inside, ensuring project safety while enhancing mechanical strength. Research and modeling have revealed that 'My Si-lium' is not only cost-effective and eco-friendly but also possesses properties such as porosity, fire resistance, and mold resistance, making it highly suitable for improving existing sound-absorbing materials. It also holds significant potential in applications like material repair and decorative protection.
https://teams.igem.org/4615	Climate Crisis	Landfill gasses (LFG) account for 23% of Canada's methane emissions, a potent greenhouse gas contributing to global warming. Current methodsmethane combustionrelease excess carbon dioxide and are ecologically harmful. Our solution involves optimizing a genetically-engineered Escherichia coli strain (T-B18) which metabolizes methanol via the ribulose monophosphate pathway (RuMP). We also demonstrated a process concept where methane is separated from LFG using cellulose acetate membranes then converted into methanol by a catalytic reactor, enabling bacterial consumption. Using Genome-Scale Metabolic Models and literature research, we generated an ordered list of genetic modifications that can increase methanol assimilation, namely TpiA and frdABCD as our knock-out targets. To quantify T-B18s methanol assimilation ability, we used HPLC to measure methanol levels in cell culture before and after modification. The engineered T-B18 strain exhibits preference towards metabolizing glucose over methanol, further tuning needed to make it a promising candidate for on-site applications at landfill sites.

Traditional chemical synthesis methods generate substantial industrial waste, posing environmental challenges. To address these issues, we have designed a yeast-based cell factory capable of environmentally-friendly, controllable fragrance production. Our approach leverages the power of light regulation using a photosensitive transcription regulator, EL222, and a specific promoter, PC120. The 450nm light triggers the expression of essential genes for the synthesis of sclareol, while represses those for santalol. This dynamic photoinduction system offers advantages such as operational reversibility, high spatiotemporal resolution, and enhanced production efficiency. Our experiments indicate that our cell factory can potentially produce fragrant bases with precise proportions of santalol and sclareol. This breakthrough promises a more sustainable and flexible future for fragrance production.

However, massive production inevitably brings serious pollution and wastewater. Large quantities of dyes are discharged into river and ocean during the garment making process. To solve this issue, our approach was through the bioremediation method. We combined two proteins (laccase and hydrophobin) with NG Catcher/Tag system. Laccase is able to decompose dye particles, hydrophobin is expected to adhere to the color catcher (our product, expected to be a platform for laccase to act on), and Catcher/Tag system can combine above-mentioned two proteins. We hope our project could be implemented in textile factories, not only breaking down synthetic dyes but also help reduce the amount of wastewater.

While it is possible to carefully examine substances with great accuracy in labs, its usually too costly or inconvenient to conduct it in everyday life. We chose BPA and bile salts as examples, demonstrating the significance and the necessity of employing portable and scalable biosensors in daily situations. This year, we designed and proposed NOX (Neo-quOrum sensing-based Xpression biosensor platform) to provide a highly compatible and robust platform with impressive performance, using synthetic biology to construct an artificially organized signaling cascade. Chimeric receptors are assembled for optimal compatibility, and the orthogonal quorum sensing module is responsible for luminescence, optimized by modeling.

This would demonstrate a useful platform for realising the bioactive potential of cyclic peptides. During our project we aimed to create a library of custom vectors for our BURP protein expression using the Freegenes E. coli Protein Expression Toolkit. In parallel, we optimized BURP domain protein expression and purification strategies using pXP vector series among other protocols and achieved successful cyclization of peptides. Throughout our project, we used conversations with experts from different fields and the public to guide our work.

Greece is the third-largest olive oil producer globally, and in our region, Thessaly, OMW poses a significant problem due to the substantial quantities generated every year. The absence of effective OMW management methods has posed challenges for olive oil producers, often resulting in improper disposal that threatens the environment. Recognizing these problems, we proposed a solution: oPHAelia, an innovative approach relying on a synthetic consortium comprised of two bacteria, Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and Pseudomonas putida KT2440, with the dual objective of detoxifying OMW and harnessing the wastes potential to produce a high-value product, called Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs).

High production and low recovery rate make PE plastic pollution a worldwide environmental problem. Current treatment of PE requires the oxidation of C-C bond using physical or chemical methods. PEase, discovered recently, is the only enzyme that can oxidize PE at room temperature. However, PE plastics will change their internal molecular arrangement and are more likely to be oxidized at high temperatures. Therefore, we optimized PEase with four rational design methods to improve its thermostability. First, we used a variety of software to screen, iterate and verify the mutation points to obtain possible mutants. Then we performed experiments on these mutants to test their thermostability and enzyme activity. We ended up obtaining 25 mutants with improved thermostability. Among them, the best mutant was improved by more than 12%. Our project lays the foundation for future industrial applications of PEase.

Team Thailand-RIS aims to alleviate this issue by modifying the Glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL) gene which plays an important role in stress response via regulating the production of Glutathione (GSH). Thailand-RIS seeks to remove chloroplast transit peptides and replace them with a mitochondrial transit sequence in order to bypass the transport process and enable the production of GSH directly in the mitochondria. After testing, this modification has no impact towards the growth of the plant, and solely affects stress responses. Plants which were subject to heat and saline stress did not show observable phenotype changes. However, plants which were subject to drought stress showed a 48 hour delay in wilting.

It can record the temporal order of the signal in DNA for a long duration. When required, the recorded information can be read out by simple molecular biological methods, such as qPCR. For signal input, we choose blue light and relevant promoters as a proof of concept. To optimize the system, we perform directed evolution on the blue light promoter, EL222. For recording, we build up a cascade editing system that consists of a CRISPR Cas9 editing system, a Lambda Red homologous recombination system, and multiple levels of self-target guide RNAs (stgRNAs) with corresponding homologous arms. Guided by our drylab model, our system could operate with high efficiency and high data deciphering activity. Furthermore, we explored several applications in diagnosis and environmental monitoring of our project. We believe in its unlimited potential.

It is necessary for growing the food we eat, protecting our homes against flooding, and sequestering greenhouse gasses threatening our planet. However, globally, soil is rapidly degrading. While Synthetic Biology has shown great potential in laboratory settings to address global environmental problems, deploying constructs effectively into messy, heterogeneous soil environments, where they must survive and express circuit genes, remains a significant challenge. The overarching goal of our project is to address several impediments facing fieldable soil synthetic biology, including appropriate chassis selection, the presence of natural adversaries such as bacteriophage, and the largely dormant metabolic states of soil microbes. We established Mycobacterium smegmatis as a soil synthetic biology chassis, characterized circuit-containing bacteria and phage in soil microcosms, employed multimodal measurement techniques, developed a novel mathematical model, and provided a comprehensive educational guidebook for future teams eager to pursue soil synthetic biology.

To counter these limitations, we developed the Queen Ant's Assassin (QAA): a gene circuit driven by quorum sensing (QS) to release drugs to target and exterminate the RIFA queen precisely. Collaboratively designed, validated in labs, and modeled dynamically, E. coli were modified, QS used as a timing mechanism, allowing gut colonization and sequenced release of protease inhibitors and toxic proteins in RIFA larvae. Through RIFA's social feeding patterns, drugs concentrate in the queen, resulting in population collapse.

Current treatments rely on antibiotics, leading to resistance and questionable efficacy. In response, our iGEM project explores the under-researched realm of recurrent UTI treatment. We've identified the microbiome's pivotal role in maintaining urinary tract balance, highlighting Lactobacillus crispatus as a key player. By engineering L. crispatus to compete with pathogenic E. coli, we aim to disrupt the adhesion of uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) to the epithelial cells, a key step in UTI pathology. Future plans involve adding antimicrobial peptides, targeting specifically UPEC without harming the microbiome. To tackle this challenge, we're developing tools for efficient gene insertion into L. crispatus, emphasizing safety by incorporating arabinose as a kill-switch inducer. Our solution has the potential to not only revolutionize UTI treatment, but also pave the way for future novel microbiome engineering applications using L. crispatus as a chassis.
https://teams.igem.org/4634	Therapeutics	TabcT (Thermal Activated Bacteria Cancer Therapy) is a temperature-controlled bacterial therapy developed by Tsinghua 2023, targeting breast cancer, and it offers the advantages of being cheap, convenient, controlled, continuous, and comprehensive. ECN, a probiotic is genetically modified and injected directly into the tumor. These bacteria cannot survive in aerobic healthy human tissue but colonize within the anaerobic tumor tissue. To precisely target and work, an AND gate is used. Only under anaerobic environment and with ultrasonic heat treatment, will the AND gate be activated and PD-L1 nanobodies be produced and released. Additionally, ECN is modified to create arginine-rich environment nearby, enhancing the performance of PD-L1. Meanwhile, through dry experiments, model and hardware design, we have made the project more perfect. We have also increased public awareness of breast health through human practice and education. We hope that our efforts can contribute to the solution of breast cancer.
https://teams.igem.org/4635	Biomanufacturing	In metal corrosion protection, biofilm can play a role in metal corrosion protection by removing corrosive cathode medium (such as oxygen), inhibiting the growth of corrosive microorganisms, and forming a protective layer on the metal surface. However, one of the shortcomings of biofilm for metal corrosion protection is its weak metal adhesion ability. NEU-CHINA team aimed to design a living functional biofilm that can be applied to marine metal corrosion protection. We named it BMCP (Biofilm for metal corrosion prevention). In this project, Escherichia coli amyloid protein CsgA and mussel foot silk protein Mfp were connected by in vitro assembly, aiming at improving the adhesion ability of the biofilm on the surface of metal materials, so as to play the role of corrosion protection better. Finally, we will achieve long-term metal corrosion protection and improve the biological safety of BMCP through biomineralization.
https://teams.igem.org/4636	Diagnostics	Research has demonstrated that early detection can make colorectal cancer highly curable. Therefore, we have decided to develop a diagnostic technology platform for cancer screening using liquid biopsy. With just a blood sample provided by the patient, we can determine the potential presence of colorectal cancer through circular RNA analysis in the serum. NanoCircDx presents clear benefits compared to existing methods for colorectal cancer detection. Our approach needs just one blood sample to evaluate the potential of colorectal cancer, offering: 1. Early identification of the disease. 2. Enhanced accuracy and speed in screening. 3. Greater user acceptance. 4. Minimal invasive procedure. Current circular RNA detection methods are limited to lab settings and lack rapid screening. Our study has great potential to establish swift circular RNA biomarker screening for colorectal cancer. Furthermore, we intend to expand this concept for diagnosing diverse diseases and their related circular RNAs in the future.

https://teams.igem.org/4638	Therapeutics	Cancer is a great threat to human health, and the development of new antitumor therapies is imminent. Studies have shown that TfR1 (transferrin receptor 1) is highly expressed in many types of tumor cells, and it is also found that influenza virus uses the internalization pathway of TfR1 to achieve virus endocytosis, and this process is produced by the interaction between NA protein (neuraminidase) on the surface of the virus and TfR1. For the wild-type influenza virus, the number and length of the surface NA protein is less than the HA protein (hemagglutinin), which makes the identification of NA protein more difficult. Our work is to increase and lengthen the NA protein on the surface of the virus through genetic engineering, so that the NA protein is more easily recognized by tumor cells with high expression of TfR1, so as to improve the tumor targeting of influenza virus.
https://teams.igem.org/4639	Diagnostics	Project Hyperion is a pioneering venture focused on developing a cutting-edge biosensor with a primary objective: early cancer detection and the identification of various anomalies through the analysis of kinome hyperphosphorylation patterns. Our journey commences with the precise construction of the biosensor and its components, primarily executed through advanced 3D printing techniques. Concurrently, we initiate the cultivation of human cell lines, specifically employing the A453 cell lines sourced from the European Collections of Authenticated Cell Cultures, forming the foundation for rigorous testing and critical assessment of the biosensor's functionality. In the subsequent phase, we meticulously extract proteins from these cell lines to evaluate hyperphosphorylation patterns through established techniques such as Western blotting. We ascertain the biosensor's capacity to accurately detect these patterns, marking a pivotal step toward transforming cancer diagnosis and anomaly detection. Project Hyperion is poised to revolutionize healthcare, standing at the forefront of innovative biotechnology.

https://teams.igem.org/4641	Bioremediation	MIT-MAHE is focusing on biodegrading triclocarban (TCC), an antimicrobial compound in pharmaceutical and personal care products. Due to its hydrophobicity and chemical stability, it is ineffectively degraded in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), resulting in accumulation in the effluent and sludge. Owing to its carcinogenic and hormone disrupting properties, TCC when exposed to the environment as sludge inhibits plant metabolism and harms endocrine functioning in aquatic life. CarbanEl aims to degrade triclocarban into non-toxic byproducts. The aim is to introduce Ochrobactrum TCC-2's TccA gene which can degrade TCC into a chassis which can inherently degrade the toxic chloroaniline byproducts using its natural, existing pathways. We decided to focus our study on P. putida, P. fluoroscens, and A. baylyi, which are all suitable candidates to serve as our chloroaniline-degrading chassis. This will effectively lower the impact of TCC on our environment, locally and globally, in aquaculture, agriculture, and human health.

Currently, tests for common conditions in womens health are rudimentary and invasive, with women often not receiving a diagnosis for many years after the onset of symptoms. Project Genoswitch aims to spread awareness about womens health and to develop a modular cell-free diagnostic test that can decrease the length of time to receive a diagnosis, by detecting upregulated microRNA biomarkers in the bloodstream, using four toehold switches in one composite gene fragment, which can each detect three upregulated microRNAs in the serum of patients with the condition. Our test specifically targets PCOS, endometriosis, breast cancer, and ovarian cancer, although it can be used more widely. This test will provide a more cost effective and non-invasive approach compared to current methods, increasing the accessibility of miRNA biomarker tests worldwide.
https://teams.igem.org/4643	Bioremediation	Pseudodeteox project aims to improve the bioremediation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), ones of the most pollutings in soils. We found that Rhamnolipids were part of bacterial surfactants capable of degrading PAHs. We also found that the combination of rhamnolipids and sophorolipdes, two surfactants, increased PAH degradation from 20% to over 90%. Our objective is to modify the bacterium Pseudomonas Putida, a bacterium known to degrade PAHs, in order to produce at the same time Rhamnolipids and Sophorolipids. Biosurfactants will help the bacteria by solubilizing PAHs, facilitating their absorbtions. The rhamnolipid synthesis pathway has already been discovered in the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but the sophorolipid pathway is present only in eukaryotic cells such as Starmerella bombicola. The main difficulty will be to transform Pseudomonas putida to produce eukaryotic proteins necessary for the synthesis of sophorolipids. Then, we want to test the effectiveness of PAH degradation by ours transformed bacteria

https://teams.igem.org/4645	Therapeutics	Feline allergies are a common source of allergens, affecting up to 15% of adults and children and causing symptoms from allergic rhinitis to severe asthma. Feline allergens, Fel d1 (Felis domesticus allergen 1), are mainly produced by the salivary glands, and when cats groom themselves, Fel d1 is transferred from saliva to their hair, and cat dander containing Fel d 1 allergen is then spread to the environment as small airborne particles. HZAU-China team this year designed C.A.T: Cat Allergic Therapy. As a novel therapy for cat allergy, the chassis bacteria, genetically programmed to adhere to the saliva pellicle of cats, produce two single-chain fragment variables (scFvs) and secrete them outside the cell. These scFvs block the immune response caused by the antigen and prevent allergies. The project aims to develop an edible probiotic cat nutriment, which is expected to be used for prevention and treatment of feline allergy.
https://teams.igem.org/4646	Therapeutics	Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has shown great promise in treating certain hematologic cancers by reprogramming patient T-cells to target tumor antigens. However, application of this therapy to solid tumors has been limited by issues such as heterogeneity of antigen expression, tumor inaccessibility, and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments. Our project describes an integrated CAR-synNotch circuit, the Intelligent Chimeric Antigen Receptor Upregulation System (ICARUS), to address these limitations. This system utilizes engineered T-cells that secrete custom antigens to activate endogenous synthetic receptors and to amplify CAR T-cell stimulation, proliferation, and cytotoxicity. By enhancing T-cell stimulation through autocrine and paracrine signaling, ICARUS aims to improve CAR T-cell efficacy against solid tumors. This innovative gene circuit represents a novel approach to overcome current challenges in CAR T-cell therapy for solid cancers.

However, due to the environmental repercussions of fertilizer synthesis and usage, an alternative is needed. We propose a sustainable biofertilizer design that replicates diazotrophs' nitrogen-fixing ability while reducing environmental impact. Our approach involves introducing nitrogenase genes into an oscillatory genetic network in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas protegens. This system can be altered to regulate the expression of varied target genes, making it a useful tool in synthetic biology. In conjunction with wet lab experiments, we used our MATLAB model to predict levels of expression of the nitrogenase enzyme in the dual-feedback circuit. We successfully assembled nifBHD, nifKEN, nifXV, and hesA into separate plasmids, demonstrating proof of the assembled operon in our system. We also were able to obtain oscillatory GFP expression via confocal microscopy.

The copy number (CN) is a fundamental feature of plasmids which affects both the production rate of the proteins encoded on the plasmid and the metabolic burden it induces on the host cell. We developed the first user-friendly software for designing the plasmids CN, which will revolutionize the way we work with plasmids. The engine of our tool is a comprehensive machine learning model which is based on thousands of features of the origin of replication (ORI) such as the promoter strength and RNA folding of regulatory elements encoded in the ORI. We also developed a protocol for efficiently manipulating plasmid ORI and demonstrated that our model can predict and design plasmid CN. Furthermore, we established an IGEM-like competition and a new synthetic biology curriculum for Israeli high school students.
https://teams.igem.org/4649	Village	Modern agricultural practices rely heavily on phosphate fertilizers. However, due to the tendency of phosphate to bond with minerals in the soil, most phosphate molecules exist in a form unusable to plants. These mineral phosphates are a driving force behind the nutrient pollution and runoff in waterways that leads to algal blooms. RhizeUP aims to engineer Rhizobium tropici, a nutrient-fixing soil bacteria known for its high tolerance to environmental stresses and which is a successful microsymbiont of several legumes. We are increasing phosphate solubility to increase plant uptake and to remove excess phosphate from the soil. Our goal is to introduce the PQQ + gdc genes which secrete gluconic acid that chelates mineral phosphates. Additionally, we utilized a codon-optimized pstSCAB operon, high-affinity phosphate transporter proteins, to transport phosphate into the cell. We believe these pathways will effectively modify rhizobacteria to decrease phosphate runoff and reduce the need for phosphate fertilizer.
https://teams.igem.org/4650	High School	The leather industry is harmful to the environment: endangered animals are killed for products, cattle needed for leather produce greenhouse gases; chemicals used to process animal skin pollute the environment and create health problems for workers involved. This inspired us to tackle the leather industry with a more sustainable approach: SCOBY (symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast). SCOBY contains lactic acid bacteria, acetic acid, bacteria, and yeast, and forms a bacterial cellulose membrane by tangling secreted cellulose fibrins. This cellulose membrane can be used as a replacement for animal leather, however, dried SCOBY is very rigid, which makes it undesirable for use in creating certain leather products. Our design creates overexpression of spider-silk proteins (MaSP-1 MaSP-2) (to enhance flexibility) in conjunction with cellulose binding domain (CBD) (to join the proteins to the SCOBY) in yeast. It is then co-cultured with regular SCOBY membrane to create a more flexible product.

Global accumulation of plastic can be counteracted by improving PET degradation in the environment. However, scientists currently lack efficient methods to measure PET hydrolysis, making it difficult to research further in this field. The goal of this project is to develop a sensitive plasmid biosensor to detect terephthalic acid (TPA), a byproduct of PET hydrolysis. The TPA-sensitive plasmids were built using a variety of promoters, importers, and reporters. Use of the MucK importer, mEmerald fluorescent protein, and changing the promoters -35 and -10 sigma factors to match that of promoter pTPA3 demonstrated the highest increase. The optimal binding configurations with TPA were predicted via molecular docking to support the results. This research makes important contributions to the field of plastic degradation as a whole.

Firstly, utilize RNAi technology to silence crucial survival genes and virulence factors of the B. cinerea, employing innovative approaches including binding cell-penetrating peptides (CPP) with shRNA to significantly treat tomato grey mold. Additionally, we will supplement this with plant immune technology by modifying Bacillus subtilis, enabling it to express immune-inducing factors such as flg22 and BvEP to trigger plant immune responses. Finally, based on the actual needs of agricultural applications, we creatively encapsulate the RNAi-based biopesticides and calcium alginate beads containing engineering B. subtilis that can trigger the immune effect of plants in a water-soluble film, forming a unique application model similar to laundry beads, which we call PolycoBead.

Lithium preparations are commonly administered to patients with bipolar and act as mood stabilizers. Due to the risk of lithium intoxication, regular monitoring of lithium levels in the blood is necessary. The test system is based on the translational riboswitch <i>nhaA</i>-II for detection and a reporter for quantification, functioning like a genetic ON switch. In response to lithium, the riboswitch will activate the expression of the reporter, indicating whether the lithium concentration has reached a certain level. The test system will provide an excellent alternative to time-consuming doctor visits and laboratory analysis of blood samples, which are required to avoid accidental under or overdosing with lithium.

One of the biggest challenges to achieving this goal is agricultural damage from wild animals, and in Kyoto, deer are the main cause of this problem. This year, iGEM Kyoto proposes a new solution that utilizes engineered E. coli for sustained production and release of repellent molecules. This solution utilizes E. coli engineered to supress its own population and recycle nutrients from dead cells for long-term production. Furthermore, to implement this system to the field, we have also designed a cheap, low-maintenance device powered only by water's latent heat of vaporization capable of long-term autonomous agitation for outdoor E. coli cultivation and repellent door dispensing. We envision crop damage by deer to be controlled by cultivating E. coli that produce repellents dispensed from our devices.

In keeping with our view of local people solve local problems, we have designed our Gut-Sweeper, namely, an engineered E. coli that integrates prevention, monitoring, and treatment of constipation. We firstly empowered our engineered bacteria with monitoring ability by the butyrate sensory module, which can detect a distinct lowered butyrate concentration, a research-proven constipation marker. The treatment role of our engineered bacteria is then established by the introduction of the metabolic module, which can catalyze serotonin synthesis, thereby promoting intestinal motility. Considering that our engineered bacteria still need to achieve a longer period of colonization to reach preventive capacity, we designed a quorum sensing module, cooperating with our tannin mucin encapsulation to allow colonization for days and strictly control the population density simultaneously.

Microplastics and nanoplastics are plastic particles that range from the nanometre scale up to 5mm. Almost everywhere scientists have looked they have found microplastics, yet only now are we beginning to understand the detrimental impact that they can have on our own health and that of ecosystems. Any solution relies on an understanding of the problem it is trying to tackle. However, all large scale monitoring efforts for microplastics have failed due to a lack of standardised and accessible detection protocols. This is the challenge that we aim to solve with LuciPEP. With the use of protein engineering, we have designed a bioluminescent fusion protein capable of binding microplastics and emitting a quantifiable glow. Our fusion protein is designed to be used in a sandwich-typed assay promising sensitive and accessible microplastic detection.

A major catalyst for this acceleration is the accumulation of antibiotics in wastewater, where bacteria can rapidly acquire resistance. In Germany and many other countries, there are no existing guidelines for the monitoring of antibiotic pollution in wastewater. Therefore, we want to provide an easy-to-use detection system that can be evaluated by anyone without specialized equipment, by a simple colour change. Our biosensor is based on the two-component systems VbrK/VbrR from Vibrio parahaemolyticus and BlaR1/BlaI from Staphylococcus aureus. Additionally, we provide two robust and reliable detection systems: a paper strip where the whole-cell biosensors are freeze-dried and alginate nanofibers which encapsulate the biosensor.

Humanity currently produces billions of tons of WCO yearly, with limited routes for its safe disposal, making it a threat to our environment. We propose to harness the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica to go beyond decontamination: our goal is to upcycle WCO into campesterol, an important steroid precursor for the pharmaceutical industry. Y. lipolytica can use WCO as a carbon source, but our team has focused on improving its access to WCO via expression of bioemulsifiers. We characterized the expression of a bioemulsifier in E coli and derived a cloning strategy for S. cerevisiae. We also optimised the best candidates in silico and integrated them into a molecular switch to optimise the metabolic burden of the expressed bioemulsifier. We demonstrate bioemulsifiers could increase accessibility of WCO as a carbon source for bacterial and fungal growth.

The mission of project LactoBack is, in light of recent discoveries, to implement a microbiome-targeted treatment of vaginal dysbiosis and endometriosis. To raise awareness of endometriosis and microbiome health, talks with professionals in women's health and surveys of patients were organized. Supplemented by computational analysis for gene target identification and optimal lactate production, we engineered an existing quorum sensing system naturally found in Pseudomonas aeruginosa to express guide RNAs for dCas9-based flux redirection. Via conditional control of the system, efficiency is ensured.

Climate Change causes early flowering in plants, making them more susceptible to frost damage. In the spring of 2017, $ 3,3 billion worth of crops were lost due to a single frost event in Europe. And unlike the flowers, this problem will only grow With our genetically engineered bacterium, PseuPomona, we restore the flowering time of fruit trees. This helps flowers remain in their buds, protecting them against frost damage. We foresee that further work in the line of our research will not only help farmers protect their crops against the challenges of climate change but also introduce a new synthetic biology tool for agriculture, to be used by future researchers and iGEM teams.

Early and accurate diagnosis of COPD is crucial for effective management and intervention strategies. In this project, we aim to utilize the diagnostic potential of miRNA biomarkers, specifically miR223 and miR1274a, coupled with the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method. Studies demonstrate that the expression levels of miR223 and miR1274a are significantly altered in patients with COPD compared to healthy controls. Moreover, the RT-PCR-based detection of these miRNAs exhibited high sensitivity and specificity for COPD diagnosis.

They are all made from the same building material: limestone. These and many other limestone architectural gems are deteriorating at an alarming rate due to environmental factors enhanced by climate change, such as acid rain, prolonged rain seasons and air pollutants. To counter this, our project employs a dual microbial system, aimed at both fortifying limestone structures and promoting calcite mineralization. Central to our project is a membrane fusion protein for extracellular display of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA), enabling the rapid hydration reaction of CO2 to calcium carbonate (CaCO3). Furthermore, our 3D DNA origami lattice, designed for optimal CaCO3 nucleation, offers a solid structural foundation for the CaCO3 crystals to adhere to.

In this project, we constructed different bioparts and modules for isobutanol production in Zymomonas mobilis. And to increase the isobutanol yield in Z. mobilis, we also employed the heterologous Calvin cycle pathway coupled with a synthetic carboxysome for CO2 concentrating and CO2 fixation. Thus, the CO2 released during the isobutanol fermentation process was absorbed and further transformed into isobutanol again, achieved an efficient zero-carbon isobutanol generation. We hope the microbial isobutanol in this project would finally replace the chemical fossil fuel to the maximum, making the flight to a sustainable future.

It is estimated to produce over 83 million liters annually, encompassing six designations of origin and spanning 13,300 hectares of dedicated vineyards. During the wine production process, 25% of the grapes end up as waste, with grape skins accounting for 50% of this waste. However, grape skins possess significant value. They contain a highly nutritious compound called resveratrol, a potent antioxidant known for its protective properties against certain cancers and its anti-aging effects. Thanks to this molecule, we have the opportunity to address a major societal concern: enhancing quality of life. This is why our team has engineered the production of resveratrol in Escherichia coli using the precursors found in the subproducts of wine production. In doing so, we not only support local production values and environmental sustainability but also promote a circular economy model.

Traditional solutions, biological or mechanical, present significant drawbacks, including limited durability, risk of rejection, and lifelong anticoagulation therapy. Our novel approach employs synthetic biology to leverage the Titin protein's outstanding mechanical properties, aiming to synthesize superior heart valve materials to enhance bio-compatibility and mechanical resilience. Drawing on cutting-edge research, we engineered E. coli microbes to produce megadalton titin polymers. These polymers, segmented and reconnected via robust protein connectors, would undergo a wet spinning process to form continuous fibers. The fibrous thread have exceptional strength and durability due to &#946;-sheet structures, envisioned as the foundation for next generation heart valve materials. Join us in weaving a future where heart valve replacements are not only more effective but also accessible to all, thereby enhancing patient quality of life globally.
https://teams.igem.org/4673	High School	We applied synthetic biology to address cardiovascular diseases in Taiwan  a pressing issue accounting for 22.5% of deaths among the elderly aged 65 or above. Through research, we found that lumbrokinase, an enzyme extracted from Lumbricus bistamus, holds promise in dissolving fibrin in thrombi, which are responsible for blood clotting and strokes. However, there were two issues: the high cost and moral implications of current lumbrokinase markets, as well as medication non-compliance and high-fat dietary habits among elderly patients with cardiovascular diseases. To address the limitations of current lumbrokinase production methods, Worm Out Clots aims to establish improvements in two aspects: probiotic platform and industrial production. We hope to develop an innovative production pathway that improves sustainability, while preventing mass killing of earthworms. Besides, developing a probiotic platform to address problems the elderly in Taiwan faced by creating an automated, in-vivo probiotic platform integrated with lumbrokinase.

This trend holds true in Taiwan. Cancer metastasis, the spread of cancer cells to other organs, is a major cause of death in lung cancer patients. Detecting these cells, known as Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs), is crucial for early monitoring. Traditional antibody-based CTC detection methods have challenges related to storage and affordability. To address this, we've developed the user-friendly CTC-FAST device, capable of automatically labeling and detecting CTCs, while allowing reagents to be stored at room temperature. CTC-FAST makes CTC detection more accessible and affordable, improving postoperative follow-up and reducing cancer metastasis-related deaths.

This includes the Western honey bee, Apis mellifera, which is responsible for the pollination of 75% of the world's crop cultivation. However, the honey bee is threatened by the Varroa mite, a parasite that feeds of the bees hemolymph and thereby transmits other diseases, such as the Deformed Wing Virus. This subsequently affects wild bees. To eliminate the Varroa mite, we utilize entomopathogenic fungi. However, they also weaken the bees.

https://teams.igem.org/4676	WIKI	Silk production is a highly labor-intensive process, with additional human ethics complications in predominately lower-income regions. We propose an alternative process of silk production through the synthesis of heavy and light chain silk fibroin proteins using expression in prokaryotic cells. This process could then be scaled for mass production with bioreactors. Caddisfly silk fibroin was studied in this project due to its unique underwater adhesive properties and thermal resistance.
https://teams.igem.org/4677	High School	The cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases (CCVD) caused by atherosclerosis (AS) rank first among various causes of death in the world, especially in an aging society, such as China. In our project, we endeavored to develop a detector used for the early screening of AS by detecting trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) and microRNAs (miR-17-5p and miR-146a-5p), all of which were reported high concentration in the urine of patients. This detector uses a filter paper biosensor to detect TMAO and miRNAs based on TMAO receptor system and toehold switch, respectively, in cell free expression system. Due to the portability, it facilitates the early screening of AS at home, providing an early warning followed by early intervention to avoid of CCVD caused by AS, which is the most risk factor for the elderly people health.
https://teams.igem.org/4678	Biomanufacturing	Curcumin is a natural compound extracted from zingiberaceae, which has attracted worldwide attention because of its antioxidant, anticancer and mildew-proof functions. At present, the method of extracting curcumin from plants is squeezing and dissolving, which consumes a lot of energy and the output is far from meeting the market demand. At the same time, traditional mineral pigments are harmful to human body, while biological pigments are healthier. Therefore, we imagine using Escherichia coli to produce curcumin, and then using curcumin's characteristics of health, mildew resistance and oxidation resistance to boost the application of curcumin in medicine and color restoration of cultural relics.

https://teams.igem.org/4683	High School	In 2021, coronary artery disease (CAD) was responsible for 375,476 fatalities. Many of these deaths could be prevented by improved diagnosis, cost-effectiveness, and less invasive procedures. Through CADlock, we promoted early diagnostics and inclusive care for underrepresented demographics. We met this goal by emphasizing accessibility, affordability, and accuracy through procedures providing preliminary care to systemically marginalized groups before disease progression. By adding a nicking endonuclease, we enhanced rolling circle amplification (RCA) into exponential RCA, improving reaction accuracy. Additionally, we improved Micro-Q by utilizing a white LED to test various fluorescence wavelengths in a single frugal device. To further accommodate the accessibility of miRNA research, we created CADmir: a comprehensive search engine utilizing large language models to organize miRNA information. Finally, we educated our peers and teachers on the applications of biotechnology, inspiring future generations to make healthy, proactive lifestyle choices.
https://teams.igem.org/4684	Diagnostics	Ovarian cancer accounts for the most deaths amongst all gynecological cancers. A staggering 80% of patients are diagnosed in the late stages of this illness, which is mostly due to its seemingly benign symptoms and the lack of a standard screening test. Those who are diagnosed in the late stages of ovarian cancer have between 15% to 25% chance of surviving past five years. Therefore, our team has set out to create a sensitive biosensor that detects early ovarian cancer biomarkers. Our design consists of a lateral flow assay coupled with a thermal method to increase sensitivity. We aim to detect ovarian cancer stem cell biomarkers, which are present in the early stages of cancer. We are incorporating the expression of antigens and antibodies in S.cerevisiae for sustainable experimenting and simulation of cancer stem cells. Additionally, our design includes CAR T-cell immunotherapy modeling as a targeted treatment for ovarian cancer.
https://teams.igem.org/4685	Bioremediation	Microplastic pollution represents a global threat to ecosystems and human health. Currently, there is no existing solution to efficiently remove microplastics from water bodies. To address this issue, we decided to engineer an Escherichia coli biofilm capable of preventing plastic particles from reaching water bodies. We demonstrated that we can overexpress Curli fibers, the main protein component of E. coli biofilms. We then went on to successfully show that our biofilm can capture microplastics. After discussing with various experts, we further developed the project in two areas: First, we added peptides to the Curli fibers which target the plastic polymers most frequently found in the environment. Secondly, we added a rubber-binding domain to the Curli fibers, which allows us to specifically capture particles originating from car tyres. Our engineered biofilm, functionalized to capture microplastics, could be implemented at multiple levels, including wastewater treatment plants, road drains, and washing machine filters.
https://teams.igem.org/4686	Foundational Advance	We aim to develop a novel stick-and-secrete bacterial-mammalian cell communication system where engineered bacteria selectively adhere to mammalian cells, then secrete a ligand to elicit a particular response in the mammalian cell. This project is designed to be a modular toolbox that can provide a diverse array of highly localized responses in mammalian cells for scientific research. We show successful proof-of-concept nanobody-antigen binding between mammalian and bacterial cells, and successful secretion of the EGF ligand, which binds to EGFR on the mammalian cell. Among the applications of our system, we envision this technology as a cheaper, more accessible alternative to CAR-T therapy, a form of cellular immunotherapy that uses engineered T Cells to locate and destroy cancer cells. At the same time, this novel stick-and-secrete paradigm can be applied in founational research to precisely stimulate certain cell types or model interkingdom interactions like those in the gut microbiome.

Despite the chemical's market prevalence, pyrethroid's neurotoxicity and ecosystem imbalances necessitate urgent remediation strategies. Our approach harnesses carboxylesterases to degrade pyrethroids into less harmful metabolites. Multiple enzymes from various species were identifies, cloned and expressed in E. coli. A quick test strip method was used to examine the enzymes' effectiveness qualitatively, and helped identified the best enzyme in realistic working conditions.

https://teams.igem.org/4695	Bioremediation	Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) present in water have recently raised concerns about their negative impact on human and animal health. Phthalates, which belong to the EDCs, are widely used in industry as plasticizers, improving the mechanical properties of plastic materials. However, they can be released from materials to the environment and reach drinking water, where their concentrations often exceed the limits set by the WHO as safe. In response to the problem of phthalic acid esters (PAEs) pollution, we came up with the idea of a protein complex capable of efficient degradation of those pollutants. Based on literature, we designed a system consisting of enzymes fused to dockerin domains that enable binding to scaffoldin, which facilitates immobilization to cellulose. We expect that the resulting engineered proteins will make it possible to create a cell-free water filtration system which will degrade phthalates to easily biodegradable benzoic acid.
https://teams.igem.org/4696	WIKI	Immunotherapy has been gaining popularity, and examples like CAR-T have been proven efficient in treating liquid cancer. However, in solid tumours, the tumour microenvironment (TME) acts as a physical barrier and prevents phagocytosis. Moreover, M2-like phenotype tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) in TME would promote tumour growth. Our lab is working on delivering the CAR transgene into the tumour-associated macrophages that target hepatocellular carcinoma. First, we will be knocking out SIRP-alpha through the use of Cas9 gene editing, which enhances phagocytosis. Second, we will be using self-replicating RNA to transfect the CAR into the macrophages, enabling safe and efficient transfection of CAR without any genomic integration.

https://teams.igem.org/4701	Environment	Our project aims to address two major global challenges: plastic pollution and food security. Our objective is to develop a proof-of-concept approach to convert PET plastic into a protein-rich biomass. The first phase includes enzymatic depolymerization of PET by the modified FAST-PETase and wild-type MHETase enzymes. We have produced PETase and attempted MHETase production via Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) strain cloning. Following, the resulting monomers of the depolymerization process, Terephthalic Acid (TPA) and Ethylene Glycol (EG), are integrated within minimal media M9. This media is used to grow Rhodococcus opacus and Comamonas testosteroni bacterial strains. By utilising the monomers as their carbon source, the microorganisms produce a biomass which is further analysed, showing a significant content of proteins. In addition, we have designed new constructs to engineer other bacterial strains, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida, to enhance the monomer assimilation pathways to improve their utilisation and the protein production.
https://teams.igem.org/4702	Biomanufacturing	We're trying to develop a new treatment for breast cancer based on the iron oxide nanoparticles linked with antibody targeting HER2 protein on some breast cancer cells. We are using a green biological method to synthesize the IONPs by the E. coli dircetly with ferric ions as the inducer. We choose to synthesize the IONPs and the antibody separately as self-assembly is still hard when the coating composition of IONPs is now clear. Then we link them together through the NHS-PEG-Maleimide bridge or through EDC-NHS linkage. For the antibody, the scFv domain of the anti HER2 antibody chose by us had been proved to be properly expressed in the SHuffle strain E. coli. So we integrate the scFv domain into vector pGLO along with the functional groups for linkage and separation. After vector transformation, protein expression, purification and IONPs linkage, finally we tested the cytotoxicity of the IONPs.

It has been reported that due to genetic and environmental factors, the increased autoimmune antibodies in the brain of ASD patients will attack neurons, resulting in neuron death and disorder of behavior. Therefore, we decided to design small molecule drugs to block autoantibodies to alleviate the symptoms of autism. We screened ferrichrome and protoporphyrin IX that could bind to antibodies in intestinal microbiome small molecule metabolism library. Our experimental group designed the engineered bacteria to produce small molecule blockers through synthetic biological pathways.

https://teams.igem.org/4706	Agriculture	The Fungilyzer project offers an innovative solution to combat phosphate depletion in agricultural soils The project is inspired by the global challenges of phosphate depletion and eutrophication, driven by the finite nature of phosphate resources. It aims to revolutionize phosphate resource management and reshape agriculture by conserving the environment. Phosphorus is a vital plant macronutrient, comprising 0.2% of a plant's dry weight and playing a crucial role in plant growth. Modern agriculture heavily relies on phosphate-based fertilizers from finite reserves, leading to resource scarcity and phosphate runoff contributing to eutrophication. The Fungilyzer project addresses these issues by using genetic engineering to create a fungus, S. cerevisiae, with a sophisticated genetic switch. This switch senses phosphate deficiency and triggers apoptosis to release stored phosphate precisely when plants need it for growth.
https://teams.igem.org/4707	Bioremediation	We chose to focus on bioremediation of Utah Lake because, not only is it a local issue, it is also used worldwide as an example of cyanobacterial blooms. Excess nutrient loading in Utah Lake is causing increased eutrophication, which leads to increased cyanobacterial blooms that produce toxins hazardous to human, animal, and aquatic life. The excess nutrients are composed mostly of nitrogen and phosphorous compounds that enter the lake primarily from wastewater treatment plants, runoff fertilizer, and naturally occurring within inorganic environmental resources. Our goal is to reduce the nutrient load of wastewater entering the lake by engineering a harmless organism to sequester phosphorus and convert nitrogenous compounds to atmospheric nitrogen, which is biologically inert. We chose the microalgae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii as the chassis for the genetically engineered machine. A second, long-term goal would be to turn the sequestered nutrients into a marketable product.

Due to the coexistence of different fatty acid pathways in XM01 strain, a large amount of MEL is formed and the accumulation of intracellular oil is caused. So the carbon flow is reconstructed to reduce the production of intracellular oil. In addition, two high-value medium chain fatty acid derivatives, alpha-olefin and 10-hydroxycapric acid, are produced by E.coli BL21. After communicating with relevant experts, it was found that benzopyrene in waste cooking oil was often difficult to degrade, so a red light system is designed to secrete corresponding enzymes to complete the degradation of this substance.

https://teams.igem.org/4722	High School	Nicotine, a potent alkaloid found in plants of the nightshade family, is a crucial component of tobacco. As an addictive organic compound capable of creating dependency, repeated use of nicotine can trigger over 20 diseases, even leading to death. Quitting smoking is undoubtedly the most effective way to prolong life, but the intense addictive nature of nicotine and its withdrawal symptoms make quitting immensely challenging. Fortunately,researchers have discovered NicX in the human gut microbiota, a substance capable of degrading nicotine. Mouse experiments have shown that degrading nicotine can reduce withdrawal symptoms in these animals. This implies that using NicX to degrade nicotine could potentially serve as a viable method for smoking cessation. We aim to further enhance the nicotine degradation through 3 means:constructing a JI-NicX fusion protein, utilizing mutation techniques, and employing cell surface display system.

Protein misfolding and cell death are two key features of AD. Scientists have identified a tardigrade protein called CAHS3 that can help protein folding and prevent cell death. In this study, we tested whether CAHS3 expression could attenuate tau toxicity in a fly AD model. We constructed a plasmid that can express V5-tagged CAHS3 protein in both culture cells and transgenic flies. We overexpressed CAHS3 alone or together with hTau in the fly eyes. Analyzing the fly eyes using SEM and our original mathematical model, we concluded that CAHS3 expression does not affect fly eye development. However, it does not provide significant improvement of the eye defects caused by hTau. In the future, we hope to test the effects of CAHS3 in other neurodegenerative disease models.

Exploring green and environmentally friendly plastic recycling methods is a pressing social need. We have conducted a project focusing on two core scientific issues: the soluble expression of PETase and the enhancement of IsPETase's degradation activity. This project combines techniques such as protein engineering, molecular docking, and molecular simulation. We have provided two effective methods for the soluble expression of PETase, which are the localization expression in the periplasmic space and co-expression with molecular chaperones. By introducing mutations and adding hydrophobic structural domains, we have improved the degradation efficiency of wild-type IsPETase by 6-fold. Our model and wet laboratory strategies can serve as a reference for future teams interested in protein engineering-related projects.
https://teams.igem.org/4725	Food & Nutrition	Cereulide is a food toxin produced by Bacillus cereus that is mainly found in pre-cooked starchy food. To detect cereulide in food samples, our team aims to create a low-cost, user-friendly colorimetric biosensor that can detect high levels of cereulide on-site, to prevent possible symptoms from cereulide poisoning including but not limited to vomiting, nausea, and potential liver damage. Our circuit makes use of the potassium ion efflux effect caused by cereulide on B. subtilis, our chassis, which activates the histidine kinase C in B. subtilis. This will result in the activation of the SinI promoter which will express a red signal when cereulide exceeds the safe level. Subsequently, if the sample consists of a safe level of cereulide, a green signal will be produced to indicate safety. To ensure safety and enhance the efficiency of the sensing process, biosensor cells are immobilized in PEG-PVA hydrogel discs as prototypes.
https://teams.igem.org/4726	Therapeutics	Blood donations are critically needed to help patients suffering from various illnesses or accidents. Blood banks face persistent supply challenges for specific blood types needed by vulnerable patients. Our project aims at making universal blood (O-) to help supply blood donations for people with uncommon blood types by removing blood cells antigens. We innovate on past enzymatic antigen removal treatments by optimizing an A and B-cleaving enzyme system, resulting in O-type blood. In particular, our proposed system for type A antigen removal utilizes a bipartite reaction, not requiring additional cofactors and matrix. Additionally, we produced the first full 3D structure of the Rh antigen complex that includes the RhD subunit, the most immunogenic one. Our extensive in silico modeling also includes fluid dynamics for our proposed implementation.
https://teams.igem.org/4727	Therapeutics	Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a critical global public health threat, with increasing mortality rates and substantial economic implications. Italy, notably affected, faces approximately 11,000 deaths attributed to AMR infections annually. A group of pathogens, collectively known as ESKAPE(E), including bacteria like Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (and Escherichia coli), contribute significantly to this crisis. WHO recognizes the urgency of research and development for antimicrobials and diagnostics. Furthermore, FAO claims that the environmental impact of AMR in agriculture and veterinary sectors. PASTA leverages on Synthetic Biology to develop novel approaches to engineer those bacteria and restore susceptibility to antibiotics. PASTA combines engineered bacteriophages and CRISPRi to target AMR, maintaining high modularity, safety, and specificity. Contextually, PASTA aims to develop novel iGEM-compliant parts to characterize those pathogens. PASTA aims include the urgency of raising awareness about AMR and drawing attention to engineered phages as possible tools in medicine and Synthetic Biology.
https://teams.igem.org/4728	Bioremediation	Through Recircuit, we will bridge the gap caused by plastics resilience to degradation and cost to recycle by engineering a bacterium that uses PET plastic, found in clear water bottles, as a feedstock for PHB synthesis, a type of bioplastic. Recycling with a biological system not only could be cheaper than chemical methods, but such a system can repurpose PET, which takes hundreds of years to degrade, into a more environmentally friendly alternative that takes just a few weeks. As a result, we can reduce PET waste by transforming it into a bioplastic, which, after use, will be easier to degrade. Our project's main goals are: 1) Introducing parts that will allow for TPA (PET monomer) degradation 2) Improving PhaF, a PHB-binding protein that helps increase PHB production and accumulation and 3) Understanding the societal implications of our project by connecting with stakeholders and interacting with the community.
https://teams.igem.org/4729	Foundational Advance	The looming threat of climate change poses an immediate risk to the global food supply. This makes the development of reliable tools for plant synbio critical, if we are to successfully produce climate resistant crops. Despite their urgency, plant synbio projects are rather scarce in iGEM due to the exceptionally hard process of plant transformation. This year, the Marburg iGEM team tackled this problem by refining plant transformation protocols for non-model species, culminating in the first successful transformation of Bambara groundnut, a valuable legume for African countries. Furthermore, we thoroughly characterized novel genetic parts in Agrobacterium, and used them throughout several iterations of the DBTL cycle to create constructs that aim to enhance plant transformation efficiency and broaden the range of transformable plants. Ultimately, we hope to enable future teams to further extend the garden of plant projects in iGEM with new and diverse plant species.
https://teams.igem.org/4730	High School	The abundance of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastics in the oceans cause issues for all types of life. The sequential enzymes, PETase and MHETase, found in the soil bacterium Ideonella sakaiensis, have shown degradation of PET plastics through metabolic activity. However, because I. sakaiensis is found mainly in soil, it is not an ideal host when attempting to degrade PET plastics in the ocean. By introducing these genes into Alteromonas macleodii, a marine bacterium, there is the possibility of being able to degrade PET in saltwater conditions using its ability to form biofilm. Using the Loop Assembly method, plasmids were constructed containing the genes that encode for PETase and MHETase. These plasmids were created in Escherichia coli and were subsequently conjugated into Alteromonas. Ongoing experiments have shown the proper L2 inserts found in our Alteromonas cells and we predict these cells should be able to degrade PET plastics in marine conditions.

https://teams.igem.org/4733	Conservation	The global bee population decline is critical, harming agriculture and the environment. Honeybees, the most widely distributed bee, are also affected. The presence of Deformed Wing Virus is a major contributor, causing deformities and leading to Colony-Collapse-Disorder. Not only causing losses for beekeepers, but honeybee infections also pose a threat to native bees and pollinators as reservoirs and carriers of disease. Our goal is to develop the world's first treatment for bee viruses leveraging our understanding of bee immune systems and synthetic biology. We will express the DWV capsid protein VP3 on the surface of Bacillus subtilis cells by fusing it to spore proteins on vegetative cells to explore bee immune responses through Trans-Generational Immune Priming and potentially develop a vaccination system against viruses. This has the potential to make a significant impact on the protection and well-being of bees, preserve ecosystems, and enhance global food security.
https://teams.igem.org/4734	High School	Toxoplasma gondii is a protozoan parasite that readily infects warm blooded mammals, and is a growing contaminant as a waterborne zoonosis. Additionally, Toxoplasma gondii has an increased prevalence in cats, resulting in transmission to humans and other mammals due to contact with contaminated cat feces. However, there is no current vaccine or drug able to be set as a treatment for T. gondii. In order to address these issues, development of a vaccine to prevent transmission of T. gondii into the environment is necessary in the absence of an effective human model of a vaccine to prevent exposure. We deliver a bacterium within the felines food which will produce a phage acting as a carrier for a known T. gondii antigen. The phage will be accepted and transitized once in the small intensive traveling into the lymph producing an immune response and antibodies that will prevent oocyst shedding.
https://teams.igem.org/4735	High School	The overuse of synthetic nitrogen-based fertilisers has caused significant damage to ecosystems across the globe. Our project aims to use synthetic biology to engineer E. coli to produce ammonia naturally, in order to decrease the fossil fuels and nitrogen pollution impact of the fertiliser industry. SOILutions aims to develop an oxygen-sensing feature that allows the bacteria to activate only under low oxygen conditions, increasing the longevity and usability of these engineered microorganisms. With the potential to increase ammonia production in soil, this synthetic biology solution may be the last piece of the puzzle for creating a consistent and far more sustainable supply of fertiliser for farms across the world. A renewable and sustainable way of producing nitrogen-based fertiliser, through our engineered bacteria, ensures the continuous production of modern crops, without causing ecological damage from nitrogen overuse.
https://teams.igem.org/4736	Biomanufacturing	As evidenced by climate change and plastic pollution, it has become increasingly necessary to develop an alternative to fossil-fuel based production, such as biologically-based production. Our project's aim is to create a polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) production platform based on a co-culture between C. reinhardtii and E. coli. Such a co-culture has been shown to nearly double the growth of C. reinhardtii. Despite being in co-culture, PHB production in C. reinhardtii is limited by several conditions: 1) it is produced in small amounts, 2) it is only produced under stress, and 3) it is limited by acetyl-CoA availability. To counter these restraints, we propose modifying C. reinhardtii to express three genes to increase PHB production. In addition, we propose modifying E. coli to produce ethanol, a stress factor that will increase PHB in C. reinhardtii. Finally, we propose inactivating the ackA-pta pathway in E. coli to indirectly increase acetyl-CoA availability.
https://teams.igem.org/4737	Therapeutics	In this project, we have developed a novel strategy that utilizes attenuated Salmonella typhimurium VNP20009 to induce ferroptosis in tumor cells. To further enhance the tumor targeting ability, we had genetically modified VNP20009 to express single chain antibody fragments on the outer membrane. Once the engineered bacteria reached the tumor tissue, it will secrete glucose oxidase into the tumor cells, mediating the occurrence of the Fenton reaction. Additionally, the engineered bacteria express shRNAs to silence the SLC7A11, leading to a reduction in glutathione levels and inactivation of GPX4. All above strategies facilitate lipid peroxidation and promote ferroptosis in the tumor cells. To ensure safety, we have implemented a toxin-antitoxin system to maintain plasmid stability and prevent horizontal gene transfer. Furthermore, doxycycline administration induces self-destruction of the engineered bacteria at the end of the treatment. With its targeting system and enhanced effectiveness, our approach represents a novel perspective in cancer therapy.
https://teams.igem.org/4738	High School	As global plastic production reaches a staggering 370 million tons in 2021 and the culture emphasizing hygiene and convenience in Japan continues to drive a prevalence of single-use plastics, emerging bioplastics such as polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) provide a sustainable alternative to conventional petroleum-based plastics. Project ESPHA attempts to explore various secretion methods in order to reduce downstream processing costs of PHA production. Existing research touches upon these systems but fails to fully explore the potential of secretion and remains poorly characterized in literature. Project ESPHA aims to collect comprehensive data and analysis for comparing various secretion systems from extensive literature review. We have compared standard type I and type II secretion systems involving HlyA and TorA secretion tags. In addition, we have characterized the novel use of vesicle nucleating peptides (VNps) for PHB secretion. Our project proposes a model for a less costly, environmentally friendly, and scalable future of PHA production.
https://teams.igem.org/4739	Therapeutics	Peptide drugs have become a focus in drug design due to their high specificity, high efficacy, and low immunogenicity. Unfortunately, the nature of peptide drugs themselves causes them to be easily degraded in the internal environment and to have difficulty crossing the cell membrane to function within target cells. Our project attempts to solve this problem. Bacterial secretion systems are diverse, and their primary role is to help bacteria cope with survival pressures, thus obtaining ecological advantages. Amongst many secretion systems, we pay particular attention to the Type VI secretion system (T6SS) of bacteria. This is a secretion system unique to Gram-negative bacteria, capable of targeting prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells and directly injecting the bacteria's effector proteins into the cytoplasm of target cells. This characteristic can be artificially transformed into a secretion system that carries peptide drugs.

Microorganisms capable of producing oxygen through photosynthesis, they live both in salt and freshwater. However, when their environment is polluted, they can cause algae blooms that are harmful to the ecosystem. Alcanivorax borkumensis is a type of bacteria that has the ability to break down alkanes, essentially decomposing petroleum into non-toxic components. A part that can give cyanobacteria the ability A. borkumensis has was engineered, with the hope that algae blooms can actually fight pollution. Three species of cyanobacteria were thoroughly researched through various experiments, and information that could benefit future scientists was gathered. The project started small, focusing on the local lake, and trying to adapt to the communitys needs. However, the team hopes that the proposed idea can help fight pollution on even larger scales, bringing a greener future one cyanobacteria at a time.
https://teams.igem.org/4741	Environment	Multidrug-resistant bacteria are one of the major threats to humans nowadays. These pathogens can result from misuse, overuse and improper disposal of antibiotics and can lead to higher health care costs, longer disease progression and higher mortality. To prevent the emergence of multiple antibiotic resistances, antibiotics must be detected and deactivated. Since beta-lactam antibiotics are among the most used antibiotics, we aim to detect them. There are many different biosensors, but they require time-consuming and complex sample preparation and incur high costs. Therefore, we develop a low-cost and easy-to-use whole-cell biosensor. We chose Bacillus licheniformis as the host cell because it possesses a chromosomally encoded beta-lactamase gene induced by beta-lactam antibiotics. A green fluorescent protein is fused to the beta-lactamase for optical detection. The incorporation of the GFP into the chromosome is done by homologous recombination. The amplification of the gene fragments was successful but further work must be done.

After 30, muscle decline is steady, reaching up to 50% by 70, resulting in disability and mortality. Globally, 50 million people suffer from sarcopenia, projected to rise to 500 million by 2050. No FDA-approved drugs exist; treatments rely on exercise, diet, and often side-effect-ridden hormone therapy. The sarcopenia treatment market, valued at $2.577 billion in 2020, is projected to hit $4.704 billion by 2030, growing at 6.1% annually. Our vision involves Live Biotherapeutic Products (LBPs), using genetically modified bacteria and yeast to produce muscle-enhancing compounds. These LBPs colonize the intestines, serving as probiotics and influencing metabolism. Recent research underscores the gut microbiota's role in muscle health, making the gut a promising target for sarcopenia therapy. Our LBP holds potential in this context, offering hope for a more effective approach to combating this debilitating condition.

This leads to the loss of valuable resources like Rare-Earth Elements that are crucial for sustainable technology. With RareCycle, we harness the power of synthetic biology to reduce wastage, replace harmful mining practices and remediate dumping sites! We model, produce, and study specialized metal-binding peptides capable of selectively capturing Rare-Earth ions from bioleached e-waste. We develop fungal mycelium as a sustainable and adaptable biofilter material by expressing these peptides on the fungal surface. We design, build and test a combined bioreactor and metal extraction apparatus, optimized to cultivate and deploy the fungi. Our mission is to provide cost-effective and easily reproducible technology, enabling every community worldwide to recycle their own e-waste.

https://teams.igem.org/4745	Bioremediation	The detoxifying ecosystems project (DECO) aims to explore a possible cure for the pollution of ecosystems with diclofenac (DF), a common painkiller usually administered in gel form. This drug is present at toxic levels within many of the world's wastewater treatment facilities. The DECO-project is focused on the degradation of DF using E.coli and B.subtilis equipped with different laccase enzymes capable of chemically modifying the drug. The B.sub-native laccase CotA was rationally designed into three mutated versions (DeCotA I, II and III). Bacillus was equipped with two non-native laccases (Yak, Lcc1), and tested for DF degradation with different types of enzymatic assays . Laccase activity modifies DF into a less toxic form that degrades more easily. To do this effectively, a bacillus biofilm would likely have to be grown on a carrier material, equipped with a fail-safe mechanism and applied in wastewater treatment following an active sludge stage.

Furthermore, the disposal of lithium-ion batteries poses a waste management challenge, with Ghana grappling with e-waste dumping. BioLith seeks to address these critical issues by implementing bacteria-based technologies for efficient lithium detection, and recycling, aiming to minimize the environmental impact and promote responsible lithium resource management. We accomplish this through our innovative multifunctional biosensor, able to detect the presence of lithium, and one of its pathfinder element Arsenic. We use the protein expression data to create a deposit probability graph, which allows our potential clients to plan an eco-friendly mining activity. To incorporate circular economy principles we also designed an approach to bio-recycle Lithium from spent batteries Together, we envision a future where lithium extraction is efficient, environmentally conscious, and socially beneficial.

However, as most disease is discovered at advanced stage due to the low rate of early detection, the current treatment can only repress and perhaps even temporarily obliterate cervical cancer. The current treatment employed might not be able to ensure full remission and proper quality of life ahead. In order to solve this obstacle, our team produces a specific drug delivery, utilizing a modified Salmonella Typhimurium A1-R strain that can secrete buforin IIb. The superiority in cancer cell selectivity, natural toxicity toward cancer, ability to induce immune system, and ability to survive hypoxic tumor microenvironment give Salmonella Typhimurium upper hand compared to conventional chemotherapy. Incorporated together, this modified strain can become the next candidate of cervical cancer therapy by complimenting chemotherapy limitation, particularly drug resistance due to the cancer cell cycle and defense.

Since conventional wastewater treatment plants are not able to effectively remove these micropollutants, they end up in nature where they can exert negative effects on various organisms. Our project aims to tackle the challenge of micropollutants by developing a diatom-based remediation platform. In using a method called live-diatom silica immobilization (LiDSI), we were able to engineer the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana to express and in vivo immobilize the enzymes laccase and FAST-PETase into its silica cell wall for the very first time. These enzymes are able to degrade major pollutants: pharmaceuticals like diclofenac and sulfamethoxazole, and PET-microplastic, respectively. To ensure biological safety in a future application, cells are lysed and the biocatalytically active biosilica isolated to then be employed as a filter material. Being based on a unicellular, phototrophic organism, our remediation platform may present a renewable, cost-efficient and scalable solution to micropollution.

Investigations of biomarkers related to MDD have highlighted the importance of the gut-brain axis in influencing mental health. An increase in Indole and a decrease in butyrate, tetrahydrofolate, and hydrogen peroxide concentrations has been noted in individuals with MDD, while tetrathionate is highly positively correlated with gut inflammation. The long-term goal of this project is to develop an E. coli multi-input ingestible biosensor for the characterization of these five metabolites implicated in MDD. An ingestible biosensor enables direct surveillance of the gut lumen, providing vital information on the microbiome which stool and serum samples cannot capture. Our proposed biosensor utilizes DNA writing with CRISPR based editors for molecular recording of signals, and pH detection as a means to establish temporal and spatial specificity in the gut.

The NCED3 promoter responds to drought conditions, marked by a striking red coloration in plant leaves when activated. In contrast, the GLR2.9 promoter detects pests and diseases, signaling its presence with a vivid yellow hue in plant leaves. PHYTO-GARD stands as an essential tool for early stress detection in plants, offering valuable insights for crop management and food security efforts.

Characterized by the development of abnormal growths or galls on plant roots, clubroot poses a serious risk to our local economy by depriving nutrients and inducing plant death in canola, our most profitable crop in Alberta. Currently, farmers outsource detection to off-site laboratories which utilize PCR amplification, a process that is costly and time-consuming. Instead, we are developing a rapid and direct ELISA testing system that utilizes rationally designed, model-based chimeric proteins fused with fluorescent probes (eGFP) that bind to P. brassicae-specific protein targets, Pro1 and PbEL04. We ultimately aim to develop a user-friendly rapid detection system, which can accurately confirm Clubroot within hours, indicating the presence of P. brassicae. Implementing our detection system would provide farmers with a rapid and affordable detection method, enabling quicker execution of clubroot mitigation strategies.

Fungi belonging to the Fusarium genus, known for its induction of "Fusarium Head Blight" (FHB) in cereal crops, cause severe crop damage and secrete mycotoxins. Current detection methods of Fusarium are lacking as they are time-consuming and require trained laboratory technicians. Our team aims to develop an early warning system for Fusarium infection using antigen binding-dependent fluorescent protein constructs. Upon binding to infected plants, this construct will interact with Fusarium producing fluorescence. The resulting red emission will be detectable with our automated drone system. This detection system incorporates AI and drone technology, to scan a field and map the fluorescent emission from our construct where infection is present.

The cement industry is vital to modern construction but produces up to 10% of yearly anthropogenic carbon emissions. The burning of limestone for conversion into the cement binding agent calcium oxide produces 90% of total cement emissions. We aimed to develop a microbiologically induced calcite precipitation (MICP) approach to bypass calcination of limestone and substitute an engineered enzymatic pathway to produce calcite crystals. Our project identified and transferred urease and carbonic anhydrase enzymes from Helicobacter pylori to Escherichia coli  a bacterial species with greater affinity for industrial production of the MICP enzymes. In addition, we developed a cost-effective biofoundry, integrating multiple robotic devices, providing precision for assaying diverse enzymatic and environmental conditions at high-throughput. Ultimately, we envisage an optimised genetically modified bacterium for industrial MICP-based concrete production that reduces the need for carbon emissions by millions of tonnes each year.

The hydroxylated product (6&#946;-OH DCA) was developed to improve the solubility and pharmaceutic properties of DCA for further applications. Herein, a combinatorial strategy was applied to construct a powerful Cytochrome P450 biocatalyst (CYP107D1, Olep) to convert DCA to 6&#946;-OH DCA. Firstly, the weak expression of OleP was significantly improved using pRSFDuet-1 plasmid in E. coli C41(DE3) strain. Next, the supply of heme was enhanced by the moderate overexpression of crucial genes in the heme biosynthetic pathway. In addition, a new biosensor was developed to select the appropriate redox partner. Furthermore, a cost-effective whole-cell catalytic system was constructed, resulting in the highest reported conversion rate of DCA to 6&#946;-OH DCA (from 4.8% to 99.1%). The combinatorial strategies applied in this study provide an efficient method to synthesize high value-added hydroxylated compounds by P450s.

In addition, we designed the engineered bacteria to be coated with liposomal vesicles embedded with specific transporters to prevent metabolic waste from being excreted and allow only salidroside to pass through. When biolens is not in use, a sleep switch is designed, in which the engineered bacteria are in a sleep state. In the use state, changes in light and temperature conditions trigger the sleep switch controlled by double input and door, and the engineered bacteria recover and enter the working state.

Part of the problem are emerging contaminants such as pharmaceuticals and heavy metals. Due to their low concentrations, these have been historically ignored, however, due to recent studies, linking them to toxicity markers in living organisms, they are now recognized as a significant environmental threat. Currently, there are no straightforward methods for detecting and quantifying emerging contaminants. Our project aimed to create an affordable, user-friendly and efficient biosensor to detect emerging contaminants in a biological platform (E. coli BL21). A device to measure the fluorescence signal, as well as the prototype for an application which allowed users to view the results was also created.

No treatments exist beyond exercise and diet regimens in the United States. The MIT iGEM team proposes CAR-P Diem: a therapy using macrophages equipped with a chimeric antigen receptor that specifically recognizes and phagocytoses interleukin 6 (IL-6) via an extracellular anti-IL6 antibody. The reduction of IL-6 in a patients body would address overstimulated inflammatory signaling cascades and reduce cachectic symptoms from its root cause. We have experimentally demonstrated that our CAR-P specifically binds IL-6; we plan to achieve a proof-of-concept of phagocytosis in our future steps. We ultimately hope CAR-P Diem can work in tandem with cancer treatment to help patients continue to fight their cancer, and we anticipate that CAR-P Diem may be broadly applicable for treating other IL-6 based inflammatory conditions!

Employing SpyTag/SpyCatcher chemistry, we efficiently assembled SpyTag-labeled eGFP and Streptavidin on the Mi3 protein cage. We demonstrated Streptavidin accessibility via FNA, facilitating the attachment of biotin-tagged antibodies to protein cages. As a proof-of-concept, we employed biotin-labeled anti-BSA antibodies, observing enhanced binding affinity to target proteins BSA. This scaffold holds promise for recruiting diverse antibodies to detect various disease biomarkers, extending its diagnostic applicability beyond heart failure. Our findings underscore the adaptability and potential of protein cages as a next-generation diagnostic tool.
https://teams.igem.org/4767	Environment	Arsenic (As) is a toxic metalloid and is widespread in diverse natural environments, ranging from groundwater, and atmosphere to soil. Hundreds of millions of people in more than 70 countries around the world face the threat of the high arsenic groundwater. Therefore, rapid and specific detection of arsenic is of significance to monitor and assess its presence in the ecosystems wherein. Electrochemically active biofilms (EABs)-enabled biosensors have shown promise in environmental applications. EABs are formed by electroactive bacteria capable of exchanging electrons with electrodes, which can sense analytes of interest by converting metabolic changes to easily detectable electrical signals. In 2023, the CUG-China team aims to develop an EABs-enabled biosensors to sense arsenic by using the electroactive bacterium Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 as chassis cells. The arsenic biosensor constructed in this project are self-sustainable, cost effective and portable devices with a wide range of applications including in-situ water quality monitoring.
https://teams.igem.org/4768	Therapeutics	Our team iGEM Toulouse tackles the challenge of side effects in cancer treatment with CALIPSO, an intelligent therapeutic liposome. It senses cancer biomarkers, produces the anticancer drug in situ, and delivers it right on the tumor site. By combining in silico protein design, genetic biosensors, cell-free protein synthesis, and biochemical network modeling, we devised an integrated liposomal platform with cell-like functionalities to specifically kill cancer cells. We engaged with a broad spectrum of stakeholders, well beyond scientists, such as supportive care professionals, cancer-fighting associations and patients, ensuring CALIPSOs real-world impact. Moreover, we developed a business strategy to transition our innovative technology into a robust therapeutic startup. We believe CALIPSO has the potential to push the boundaries of chemotherapy by combining the strength of therapeutic liposomes and bottom-up synthetic biology. Using genetically engineered liposomes as a chassis enables a wide array of new applications, which will inspire future iGEM projects.
https://teams.igem.org/4769	Environment	Cambridge is working on a protective B. subtilis biofilm that can colonise surfaces and resist invasion by pathogenic bacteria. We aim to apply our biofilm in animal farms to reduce pathogen load, so that preventative antimicrobial use in agriculture can be reduced. By over-expressing biofilm-related genes and knocking out sporulation, we created a biofilm that can resist foreign invasion. We have also incorporated an E. coli QseB/QseC two component system into B. subtilis that would allow it to express sfGFP upon sensing a quorum sensing molecule autoinducer 3, which is released by gram-negative pathogens. This pathogen sensor would notify farmers a need for targeted disinfection, so farmers can clean before diseases appear and clean only when necessary, thereby reducing the risk of infections and the cost of labour.

Our project, AlgaGenix, is genetically enhancing the model microalgae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii so it absorbs more nitrates and transforms them into cytokinins, an organic phytohormone. We aim at recirculating the excess of fertiliser applied to fields as well as filtering polluted waters.
https://teams.igem.org/4771	Software & AI	Antibody drugs, with their better specificity and lower side effects, account for a large proportion of newly approved human drugs. However, the development of drugs for various types of animals is a very slow process. Inspired by the humanization of mouse-derived antibodies, we hope to design antibodies suitable for more species. Leveraging deep learning technology and based on self-collected antibody data, we develop a comprehensive automated monoclonal antibody drug design system. Our system starts with the other sources of antibody sequences against target species antigen (such as mouse-derived antibodies), automatically generates antibody sequences that may have better efficacy and lower immunogenicity, and performs comprehensive scoring. It then provides users with improved antibody sequences based on their specific requirements. This system can accelerate the development of monoclonal antibody-based animal drugs. Our work helps animals avoid suffering from diseases, and contributes to creating a better living environment for both humans and animals.
https://teams.igem.org/4772	Agriculture	The greenhouse effect and the resulting climate change pose significant challenges to global food security and land availability. Microalgae offer a promising solution to address these challenges. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, in particular, has unique characteristics that make it valuable. However, one significant challenge of it is its low light energy conversion efficiency. Another area of focus is metabolic flow regulation, specifically in relation to starch accumulation. Understanding and modifying the starch metabolic pathway in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii can enhance the accumulation of this valuable energy storage molecule, making it an ideal feedstock for various applications, such as biofuels, bioplastics, and food additives. Efforts to optimize the carbon dioxide concentration mechanism in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii can also contribute to its efficiency as a carbon dioxide sequestration tool and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and addressing climate change.
https://teams.igem.org/4773	Bioremediation	With every breath, there are tons of substances that go into our body, air quality and our health are closely linked. However, air is more dangerous than we think. Benzo[a]pyrene, nicotine, and formaldehyde in cigarettes are the first-grade carcinogens. Indole, butyric acid, and hydrogen sulfide often pervade public restrooms, waste receptacles, feline litter areas, and other communal spaces. These malodorous gases not only disrupt the ambiance but also irritate both the ocular and respiratory faculties, potentially leading to health ailments. Our project involved designing metabolic pathways to degrade these substances. We have developed a hardware that can be loaded with engineered bacteria to purify gases to make this project more beneficial for human beings. A new modeling method has been developed to improve protein structure prediction and function through directed evolution.
https://teams.igem.org/4774	Therapeutics	Our project addresses the critical issue of Osimertinib resistance in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). NSCLC accounts for 85% of all lung cancer cases and the average five-year survival rate is only 28%. Apart from common treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy, and checkpoint inhibitors, Osimertinib, as the first-line targeted therapy for NSCLC patients with an EGFR mutation, can develop acquired drug resistance, thus affecting its long-term efficacy. Our team has therefore established an innovative approach that involves developing a cyclic peptide on the bispecific antibody which simultaneously binds EGFR and c-MET to overcome the Osimertinib resistance, and to inhibit tumour cell proliferation. This solution not only improves therapeutic results but also significantly reduces production costs, thus improving accessibility. Through various outreach methods and consultations, we have actively engaged the wider community to inform our work, ensuring our solution is not only scientifically strong but also socially and economically viable.

https://teams.igem.org/4778	Diagnostics	The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a common metabolic disorder caused by many risk factors, such as hypertension, dyslipidemia and central obesity, which increases the risk for cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and even colon cancer. Nowadays, MetS has become one of the major public-health challenges worldwide. However, lack of early diagnosis hinders the timely awareness of MetS. Therefore, we have developed a new testing system with double enzymes, DSN and Cas12a, combined with one circular probe that consists of anti-sense DNA sequence for target microRNA and specific sgRNA, to catch the trace microRNA in the plasma and then convert target microRNA quantities into visible signals by colloidal gold particles for early MetS diagnosis. With linear and exponential amplification advances, our system could successfully detect the disease-related microRNA in plasma. After reading the results by APP, our system could provide the diagnosis report about MetS, even telemedicine.

https://teams.igem.org/4780	Bioremediation	In our project, we engineer heavy-metal binding proteins (MBPs) localised to encapsulin-nanocompartments delivered by bacteriophages into bacteria to capture and sequester toxic arsenic compounds. Our vision is to have engineered phages cause bacteria to produce the necessary bioremediation tools and clean up any heavy metal waste, not just arsenic. This strategy will be cost-effective, non-toxic and non-invasive. We successfully cloned and expressed encapsulins and novel metal binding proteins designed using machine learning methods. We also identified problems with the GC content of proteins designed using RFdiffusion, a new protein design program. Furthermore we cloned several guide RNAs into multiple phages and are beginning to test the delivery of our binding protein sequences into these phages. In the future we plan to test the binding and kinetics of our metal binding proteins, test the delivery of our sequences into phages and then expression in the phage target bacteria.
https://teams.igem.org/4781	Agriculture	India is one of the largest producers as well as consumers of rice and yet, our farmers are plagued by a host of diseases that cause immense crop loss every year. Bacterial blight, caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae causes severe epidemic in rice fields across the country, and destroys upto 75% of rice crop in some cases. The absence of detection kits in the market only leads to confusion and worsens the situation. Annual losses caused by bacterial blight is estimated at U.S. $3.6 billion in India alone. Existing solutions like chemical pesticides and antibiotics have not proved very effective, and after much research, we came up with a two fold solution to this problem. Xanthacinator comprises an easy-to-use colorimetric detection kit that farmers can use to detect Xanthomonas infection, and a novel outer membrane mediated delivery of CRISPR machinery for targeted killing of Xanthomonas.
https://teams.igem.org/4782	Therapeutics	Cancer remains one of the deadliest diseases in the world despite the advances in current diagnosis and treatments. Current challenges in onco-therapy include targeting, specificity, and side effects. With that in mind, we are focused on applying synthetic biology to develop a live bacteria-based antitumor therapeutic vaccine delivered in situ to solid carcinomas by a thermosensitive hydrogel. We will use a non-pathogenic strain of E.coli BL21 (DE3) to produce a native to the bacteria pore-forming toxin, Colicin E1, expressed in response to a high lactate presence in the tumor microenvironment. To prevent a harsh immune reaction, we encapsulate bacteria into a chitosan-based thermosensitive and biodegradable hydrogel, solidifying in situ upon injection. As a result of the project, a smart, localized, and controlled therapeutic vaccine will be developed to be injected once and ensure sustainable drug release for a determined period.

https://teams.igem.org/4785	Therapeutics	Bacterial biofilm is an environmental adaptation structure formed by microorganisms. After reaching maturity biofilms, intestinal pathogens will develop resistance to antibiotics and host immunity, elicit infection repeatedly, and induce diarrhea or inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. In mature biofilms, the network structure formed by eDNA is crucial for the maintenance of biofilm stability. The objective of this endeavor was to modify Nissle 1917 so that it could identify Pseudomonas aeruginosa, stimulate the production of recombinant HMGB1 protein and PslG polysaccharide enzyme, degrade the compact structure established by eDNA, and eradicate resistance to biofilm. The use of these engineered bacteria in the prevention and treatment of diseases brought on by enteropathogenic biofilm infections is possible.

This pili is currently the most conductive biomaterial discovered by humans, and its conductivity is highly sensitive to changes in surface charge distribution. We have analyzed the structure of this protein and performed innovative epitope tagging modifications on the pili, enabling the specific binding of the target substance to the pili's surface, thereby affecting the pili's conductivity. By detecting changes in conductivity, we achieve real-time quantitative detection of antibodies.

Conditions such as hypercholesterolemia, atherosclerosis, osteoporosis, and various cardiovascular diseases resulting from excessive cholesterol intake are of great concern. Current clinical treatments primarily rely on medication to control cholesterol levels, but they come with associated side effects, creating new health risks. To address these issues, LZU-CHINA has developed a probiotic-based cholesterol-regulating system, using an oleic acid inducer as the promoter module. This system introduces three types of genes: IsmA, BCoAT, and BSH, to directly convert cholesterol, influence cholesterol absorption, and promote bile acid excretion. By combining direct and indirect pathways, the system improves the efficiency of cholesterol regulation. Appropriate thresholds of oleic acid concentration activate the expression of these genes. LZU-CHINA aims to achieve precise regulation of cholesterol levels under high-fat diets, thereby preventing hypercholesterolemia and related cardiovascular diseases.
https://teams.igem.org/4789	High School	Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer among women globally. Peppers plasmid is a newly developed tool that can be used for real-time, high-throughput quantification and even visualize the location of RNA in live cells. Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), including miRNA and lncRNA, modulate a wide array of growth and differentiation processes and become potential diagnostic biomarkers in cervical cancer. Metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) has been reported to be upregulated in cervical cancer tissues and work as miRNA sponges through binding to specific miRNAs. Previous studies indicated lots of miRNAs downregualted in cervical cancer could bind to MALAT1, for example, miR-203-3p, miR-22-3p, miR-429, miR-152-3p, and miR-145-5p. Therefore, we will clone the specific miRNA binding sequence from MALAT1 into pepper plasmid, which can monitor the change of miRNAs in cervical cancer.This system will offer a promising approach for early diagnosis of cervical cancer by measuring fluorescence activity.

In 2016, researchers identified PETase that can depolymerize PET into monomers. However, PETase was limited by temperature ranges. To overcome this challenge, we reconstructed ancestral sequences of PETase by employing the profile-HMM algorithm. To further enhance the thermostability and catalytic efficiency of ASR-PETase, we used machine learning algorithms to identify stabilizing variants. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was used to demonstrate the driving force behind the increased degradation capacity. Subsequently, we constructed a two-enzyme system to produce homogeneous TPA to achieve closed-loop recycling of PET. Our project is committed to educating the public about the current situation and solutions to plastic pollution and to providing a green and sustainable solution strategy for PET degradation.

We propose to convert straw into non-food feed to ease economic pressure on farmers and protect food security. Our project created a Saccharomyces cerevisiae that efficiently uses cellulose by fusing and expressing three cellulase genes, effectively converting cellulose into single-cell proteins. Considering that there are also many xylan in the straw component, we purified a high-enzyme active xylanase and optimized the xylose isomerase promoter for efficient xylose utilization. Multi-link interaction finally realizes straw hydrolysis and efficient production of high-quality protein. Our project aims to alleviate the pressure on animal husbandry operations, provide new solutions for optimizing the allocation of social straw resources, and develop new ideas to cope with the food crisis.

Currently, commercial manufacture of 1,5-PDO entirely relies on petroleum feedstock, which is constrained by the limited accessible C5 petroleum feedstocks. In our work, we developed a cell factory to produce 1,5-PDO from glucose in Escherichia coli through the synthetic biology tools. Firstly, an artificial 1,5-PDO biosynthetic pathway was designed and assembled in E. coli. Subsequently, we improved strain production ability by optimizing gene expression plasmid and knocking out the genes of branched pathways. Finally, we further optimized pathway by engineering limiting enzyme of MmCAR through the mutation and protein scaffold assembly strategies.

The enzyme immobilised on a gold nano-electrode converts the nitrite concentration into an electrical signal. By measuring the current generated by the electrode, the sample to be tested can be accurately detected. An electronic switch will also be designed to regulate the delivery of nitrite reductase to the sample. In this way, when the current signal exceeds a preset threshold, the switch triggers the delivery of nitrite reductase, thus enabling the harmless treatment of nitrite.

Enzymatic degradation offers one potentially green way to achieve the recycling and utilization of plastic waste. Poly (ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is one of the most abundantly produced synthetic polymers, making up 12% of global solid waste. Enhancing the capture and gathering of plastics is crucial for increasing the hydrolysis efficiency of PET hydrolase degradation. Due to the characteristics of spider silk protein, this protein complex is expected to have toughness and stickiness, which facilitates the binding of plastic. In this study, we successfully constructed the prokaryotic expression system of PETase (PET-digesting enzyme) and R (a repetitive region of pyriform silk gene PySp1) fusion protein. Our results show that PETase-R recombinant proteins significantly improve the degradation efficiency of PET plastic.

https://teams.igem.org/4807	Therapeutics	Addressing the global burden of cancer, and especially solid tumors, which account for approximately 90% of cancer cases worldwide, we propose IRIS: Unleashing the light within. IRIS is a novel therapeutic approach merging Photodynamic Therapy and Bacterial Mediated Tumor Therapy, two promising methods employed in the battle against cancer. By utilizing E.coli, a facultative anaerobic bacteria species, we specifically target the nutrient-rich hypoxic regions of solid tumors and express the necessary genes for an efficient therapy. Overexpression of four genes from the hem family leads to the accumulation of 5-ALA, a precursor for the photosensitizer PpIX. Subsequently, rhtA, an exporter also expressed by IRIS, transports 5-ALA into cancer cells, resulting in the accumulation of PpIX. The PS molecule reacts with oxygen, generated by human catalase even in hypoxia, and 410nm light, generated by the interaction of Rluc8 and methoxy-e-coelenterazine. This dynamic interaction results in ROS production, achieving cancer cell cytotoxicity.

Moreover, they can produce distinct fluorescent signals to indicate the presence of pollutant concentrations that surpass safety standards. The co-culture system also incorporates cyanobacteria, which perform photosynthesis to absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen, thus regulating indoor carbon dioxide levels.

https://teams.igem.org/4810	Diagnostics	The goal of our project is the creation of a portable diagnostic kit for the detection and quantification of specific Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) from skin sebum. Those compounds have been associated with Parkinsons Disease (PD), with evidence pointing to their change in concentration occurring long before the evident onset of the disease. The alternative way to measure these compounds would be a GC/MS machine, with obvious drawbacks. Our proposed way for this detection is using the M13 Bacteriophage as a colorimetric biosensor. This technique utilizes the phages capsid proteins, which can obtain affinity for the target compounds by genetic engineering. After the VOC-protein binding has occurred, the phages swell, changing the way they interact with light, and finally giving off a different color. This color is structural (not dependent on dyes) and non-iridescent (not affected by the viewing angle), and can then be captured and quantified by a camera.

Our goal is to create a quick, cheap, and easy-to-use PFAS biosensor to aid detection. To do so we use an aptamer specific for one of the most well-known PFAS, namely PFOA. We combine the aptamer with a trans-encoded genetic switch, known as a tRNA mimicking structure (TMS), which is novel to iGEM. Furthermore, we have developed the software tool AptaLoop, to aid future researchers in streamlining aptamer design and modelling.

Notably, we successfully demonstrated the functionality of the pFrmR construct, exhibiting a color change in the presence of formaldehyde. Additionally, contrary to the literature suggesting tdTomato RFP's higher fluorescence intensity, we observed that dTomato RFP colonies displayed a more visible coloration, making it a more suitable candidate for our devices.

https://teams.igem.org/4814	High School	There are millions of new cases of cancer around the world every year. Current research has been focusing mainly on cancer therapy but not prevention. To reduce cases of cancer and prevent cancer, knowledge about carcinogens is necessary. However, current methods to identify the genotoxic agents are time-consuming testing, involving animal testing and the use of many chemicals. To address this problem, we developed two biosensing systems with DNA repairing mechanisms: (1) Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) systems with ATRIP and RPA1 in human cells, and (2) a RecA-eGFP reporting system in E.coli. We can detect DNA damage by analyzing the binding of ATRIP-EGFP and RPA1-mCherry using FRET. Additionally, we built two RecA promoters with different RBS and tested them with various carcinogens using plate readers and cell imaging. With these systems, we can screen substances for their potential carcinogenic properties in a cost-effective manner, thereby, helping cancer prevention.
https://teams.igem.org/4815	Foundational Advance	Data is the biggest obstacle in the application of artificial intelligence. For biotechnology, acquiring data means a significant investment of manpower, time, and financial resources. In reality, often only tens of thousands of data points are accessible, while high-performance AI requires data on a scale of at least a million. To cross over the gap of data requirement, we innovatively employed the paradigm of 'pre-train + fine-tuning', and aimed at the key component of synthetic biologypromoters. Our AI model shows high ability in learning the inherent features of promoter sequences based on limited experimental data. Meanwhile, our AI model can successfully generate promoter sequences with specific expression rates, making highly efficient optimization to yeast promoters. Furthermore, our AI model proves that our paradigm of transfer learning has strong scalability and can be successfully expended to almost every aspect of synthetic biology, present a realistic answer for using AI in biology.
https://teams.igem.org/4816	Bioremediation	Nitrate pollution, driven by excessive fertilizer use, poses significant health and environmental risks, particularly in developed countries like Germany. This study explores the development of a novel approach to combat nitrate pollution in groundwater. Current methods, including "Wasser Bildung" a dilution technique and chemical seequestration of nitrate, have limitations in terms of cost and efficiency. The proposed solution leverages synthetic biology to transform nitrate through a cell-free denitrifying cycle using enzymes found in native denitrifying bacteria. By modifying key cytochromes in the pathway, the goal is to create a cost-effective biocatalytic process. With the rising challenges of population growth and urbanization, this project holds promise in addressing nitrate pollution and its implications for human health and the environment.
https://teams.igem.org/4817	Environment	Hydrogen sulfide(H2S) is a harmful gas in urban sewers, due to its toxicity, pungent odor, and flammability. Sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB), the main source of H2S in sewer, tend to resist the current chemical treatment once the biofilm formed. Here, we designed a predator, SRBioQuencher to kill SRB, thereby reducing the high H2S concentrations in sewers efficiently and safely. Cocktail therapy was applied by equipping SRBioQuencher with the ability to eliminate SRB biofilms by introduced glycosidases to degrade their main skeletons, inhibit the reformation of SRB biofilm by degrading the quorum sensing signal molecules, and kill SRB by the expressed antimicrobial peptides. Besides, H2S produced by SRBioQuencher was oxidized, the number of SRBioQuenchers was regulated efficiently and safely by a suicide system induced by SRB quorum sensing molecules. Our project provides a comprehensive and safe biological control strategy for prevention and control of harmful bacteria prone to the biofilm formation.
https://teams.igem.org/4818	Therapeutics	Called the "silent" pandemic, antibiotic resistance is one of the most important issues that contemporary medicine faces today. Causing millions of deaths per year all over the world, the number keeps rising to a predicted 10 million deaths in 2050. It is mainly due to our over-consumptions through the years. But for now, no technological solution exists, and no new antibiotics have yet been discovered. To avoid this disaster, the INSA-ENS-Lyon1 team created SuperBugBuster, a project and a tool capable of removing resistance from bacteria. Based on two different approaches: CRISPR-cas9 and Bac-PROTAC systems, it permits an innactivation of a targeted resistant gene and the degradation of the associated proteins. The project construction also includes creating software to design CRISPR-cas9 RNA guide genes and important work on human practices and education of society, which is the core and the beginning of the issue of antibiotic resistance.
https://teams.igem.org/4819	Therapeutics	Everyone deserves to be healthy, but not everyone has that privilege. Billions of people from poverty-stricken regions suffer from Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs), caused by pathogens found in their communities. At HelmiGuard, we have created an oral vaccine to help forge a path to hope for two of the deadliest NTDs: echinococcosis & cysticercosis. Using adeno-associate virus phage (AAVP) technology - a filamentous bacteriophage modified to interact with human cells - we hope to target and destruct the larvae in the small intestine, before they can grow and spread. Specifically, we plan to utilize an RGD-4C peptide motif to interact with alpha integrin receptors found on dendritic cells within the Peyer's Patches. By doing so, we are not only improving patient outcomes, but also working to break the cycle of hopelessness & poverty that these diseases create. HelmiGuard is more than a vaccine - it is a beacon of hope.
https://teams.igem.org/4820	Diagnostics	The problem of iron deficiency anemia affects close to 25% of the global population and most heavily those of lower socioeconomic status (StatPearls). Currently, iron levels are most commonly detected by labs testing blood samples from patients which can be expensive and time consuming. Were creating a non-invasive method to measure iron levels by detecting salivary ferritin, a protein that stores iron, using a peptide or DNA aptamer. We plan to create an electronic, inexpensive biosensor in which the aptamer detects and binds to ferritin in saliva, emitting a fluorescent signal proportional to the concentration of the ferritin analyte. This signal is then read by an Arduino sensor and prepared to be displayed on a user interpretation system that can generate understandable iron level results. We found both aptamers through extensive literature review and computational docking. Were now testing both aptamers through direct biotin-streptavidin ELISA.
https://teams.igem.org/4821	WIKI	Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are widespread persistent pollutants that pose a health risk to humans and wildlife. While bioremediation of PCBs has been demonstrated in bacteria expressing the biphenyl degradation pathway (bph gene cluster), efficiency varies depending on the number and position of the PCB chlorines. A critical step for bioremediation of PCBs is therefore the removal of PCB chlorine atoms catalyzed by dehalogenase enzymes. Unfortunately, these dehalogenase enzymes are often oxygen-sensitive and thus difficult to implement in a wastewater setting. Hence, NpRdhA, a non-oxygen-sensitive dehalogenase enzyme was computationally redesigned for expression in E.coli, with potential implementation in biofilm for wastewater treatment. Here, we report mutated sequences, generated using a deep-learning based software, that when evaluated by a Rosetta evaluation model we developed suggest a theoretical increase in enzyme activity. Parameters for implementation were also explored through the kinetic modeling methods documented on our wiki page.
https://teams.igem.org/4822	Diagnostics	According to the data from the World Health Organization, diseases related to inflammation contribute to more than 50% of global deaths. Our team aims to develop a non-invasive, accessible, and affordable bifunctional biodevice that can perform real-time detection of inflammatory responses. We designed an engineered bacteria that can detect target inflammatory biomarkers. The detection results will be transferred into signals like fluorescent protein expression or electric currents in the bacteria. We developed hardware devices that can observe the changes in these signals and transmit the data to our software system, which could offer users real-time wellness reports. Beyond just diagnosing inflammation, we provide users with hesperetin to relieve inflammation. Hesperetin is a flavonoid compound that has various health benefits, including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. The ultimate goal is to integrate health monitoring into peoples daily lives, and develop a probiotic to provide hesperetin supplement to relieve inflammation.
https://teams.igem.org/4823	High School	Melioidosis is an infectious disease caused by a gram-negative bacteria Burkholderia pseudomallei containing biofilm in contaminated area, affecting people in Hong Kong with 34 cases including 7 deaths. Since its a multi-drug resistant, the conventional therapy for Melioidosis has proven futile and the clinical therapy for Melioidosis last for 20 days. Therefore, to combat this issue, an effective way to prevent the spread of B. pseudomallei is urgent. Our team has designed an engineered biosensor model to counter measure the issue. The biosensor will cleave the AHL molecules until the disruption of biofilm. Consequently the virulence of the bacterium will be reduced. When there is no more AHL molecules, the biosensor will carry out its apoptosis. We are targeting not only an easy way to detect pathogens, but also countering the contamination effectively.
https://teams.igem.org/4824	High School	War, famine and plague are the three major challenges facing humanity. The COVID-19 pandemic in recent years has made people actually aware of the immense threat posed by this modern plague. Modern pharmacology and clinical practice have demonstrated the significant antiviral properties of various plants. Therefore, it is crucial to utilize synthetic biology to identify and synthesize antiviral compounds found in plants on an industrial scale for drug development. In this study, we employed pre-transcriptomic data to screen and clone the antiviral-related genes UGT72B2 in I. indigotica. Subsequently, we constructed a prokaryotic expression vector to characterize the function of UGT72B2 through in vitro enzymatic reaction. The enzymatic assay revealed that UGT72B2 catalyzes the production of glycosides from four types of lignans, namely lariciresinol, pinoresinol, secoisolariciresinol, and matairesinol. Our research provides a foundation for the efficient heterologous synthesis of lignans or lignan-derivative glycosides, which are key antiviral components of I. indigotica.
https://teams.igem.org/4825	High School	The invasive species Achatina fulica (Giant African Snail) is an infamous culprit triggering a tremendous number of ecological issues worldwide, especially in Shenzhen, China. There are also growing concerns about its primary nematode, Angiostrongylus cantonensis, which results in human lethal diseases. GAStroPurifier is a comprehensive solution aiming at minimizing the harmful influences caused by Achatina fulica, with the six-step solution called ALERTS: ATTRACT snails by &#945;-pinene and isoamyl acetate with fruit odors, LOCK snails with our non-injurious hardware, ELIMINATE the parasites Angiostrongylus cantonensis with synthetic cry protein, REASSURE the killing effects by parasite detection with snail's mucus before manual TRANSFER, with a kill SWITCH functioned on genetically engineered yeasts for biosafety guarantee. Through these attempts, GreatBay-SCIE will not only provide our local community with a templated approach for integrated control of invasive species, but also significantly contribute to worldwide agriculture and healthcare from the roots of parasitic infections.
https://teams.igem.org/4826	Software & AI	Prokaryotes have evolved various protein delivery systems that enable these organisms to interface with host cells. One example, the extracellular Contractile Injection Systems (eCISs) are syringe-like protein complexes that can inject proteins into host cells. Despite the potential as programmable protein delivery tools, only a few eCISs have been characterized. Here, we designed the BioRocket platform to systematically mine eCISs from prokaryotic genomes using machine learning and structure-based protein alignment methods. We use BioRocket to analyze more than 80,000 available bacterial and archaeal genomes and ultimately predicted 5,524 novel eCISs based on sequence and structure information. We further conducted wet-lab experiments to validate the predicted data. Our work has significantly expanded the diversity of eCISs, laying a solid foundation for their future use as a programmable protein delivery tool in synthetic biology research and clinical therapy.

A novel and convenient method for treating myopia is urgently needed in modern society. 7-mythylxanthine(7-MX) is a promising compound to alleviate myopia by delaying the elongation of the eye axis. However, further development and utilization of 7-MX are inhibited by its lofty price. Our project made it possible to produce 7-MX with coffee residues as the materials. Furthermore, we further increased the yield of 7-MX by modifying both the genetic circuit and proteins.

To tackle the rising incidence of dengue fever, which affects 96 million people annually, we at iGEM TokyoTech have developed a low-cost, high-sensitivity, high-throughput testing method. Our system uses glowing cells coupled with an enhanced PCR assay to identify both past and current infections. We aim to share this data with the public and governments, promoting good health for all and working towards eliminating health inequalities.
https://teams.igem.org/4829	Therapeutics	We propose a unique, immunotherapeutic strategy to combat endometriosis. Largely, we aim to produce the antibody O-1L8-15 to block Interleukin-8 (CXCL8), a chemokine advancing endometriosis. A previous study used monoclonal antibodies to block IL8, reducing endometriotic tissue volume in monkey models. Our goal is to specifically target the peritoneal concentration of IL-8, using biochemistry and microfluidics to attach an aptide to an LNP, enhancing disease specificity. We have designed the mRNA constructs which code for this. These constructs have been shown to produce the antibody and secrete them out of the cell, (production within the 6 hours time point). The microfluidic chip we are using to assemble the LNPs has also been made and used successfully with good encapsulation efficiency. We are sharing our mRNA designs with the BioBricks registry, and for the first time, introducing an mRNA-based therapeutics platform for future teams to use.
https://teams.igem.org/4830	Foundational Advance	Prime editing is a recently developed versatile genome editing technology that offers high efficiency, versatility, and specificity. Unlike traditional methods, it enables precise alterations to genomic DNA without the need for DNA double-strand breaks. Despite numerous optimizations, MMLV RT remains a commonly used reverse transcriptase in prime editing (PE), yet it still exhibits certain limitations that may impede PE efficiency. To address this issue, the NTU-Singapore team identified and developed PFV RT as a viable alternative to MMLV. We rigorously assessed the performance of the prime editor containing PFV RT at various endogenous and therapeutic sites, as well as in a TLR reporter system custom-designed by our team. Beyond standard cell lines, successful transfections were achieved in H9 and ACS1030 stem cell lines. Additionally, attempts were made to express the prime editor in alternative hosts such as bacteria and yeast, expanding its potential applications.
https://teams.igem.org/4831	Bioremediation	There is a high possibility that methylmercury is inside you. It bioaccumulates through food chains gathering up in organisms near the top: fish, seals and us humans. Methylmercury is toxic due to its affinity to sulfhydryl groups, which bind to proteins and disturb their functions. This causes health risks, such as neurological and fertility problems, in organisms. We, team ABOA, are fighting this with our friend Synechocystis. Synechocystis is a cyanobacterium that uses light and carbon dioxide as its energy thus it is a unique sustainable solution. With synthetic biology we are enhancing the capture of the methylmercury from waters and then we gather it up safely. This is achieved by expressing merB protein that cuts the bond between methyl and mercury and merA protein reduces the ionic form to elemental mercury. We are fighting to ensure clean habitats, ecological balances and the safe use of fish for us all.
https://teams.igem.org/4832	Agriculture	The willow leaf beetle Plagiodera versicolora (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) is one of the most important forest pests worldwide, which primarily feeds the leaves of Salicacease plants. In this study, a combined strategy of microbial control and RNA interference-based technology was utilized to manage the P. versicolora. Recently, our team isolated a Pseudomonas chlororaphis B3-3G strain that exhibits certain resistance to P. versicolora, but the insecticidal effect was not ideal. To improve its anti-insect effect, we proposed to express double-stranded (dsRNAs) targeting the actin gene of P. versicolora in P. chloroaphis B3-3G. To further increase the accumulation of dsRNA, the ribozyme III encoding gene of P. chloroaphis B3-3G was knocked out via homologous recombination mediated by pK18mobsacB. At last, the dsRNA-producing Pseudomonas was sprayed on leaves of Salicacease plants to test its insecticidal activity. &#61623;

Based on the above background, the JLU-NBBMS team adheres to synthetic biology and tries to use engineering-modified bacteria to treat solid tumors. We plan to treat colorectal cancer using attenuated salmonella carrying small nucleic acid drugs. The attenuated salmonella can take small nucleic acid drugs, accurately target cancer tissue, and quickly enrich them. It can play an anti-cancer role through bacterial tumor-lytic action, small nucleic acid drug-specific killing of cancer cells, and the triple mechanism of stimulating the body's immune response. It can use salmonella itself while integrating targeted therapy and immunotherapy. Killing cancer cells, accurate and effective treatment of colorectal cancer.
https://teams.igem.org/4834	Therapeutics	Blood donation shortages are a pressing concern for health facilities worldwide. Additionally, the availability of blood donations is further limited by the incompatibility of blood types. Among the four canonical types, only group O is universally suitable for donation due to the absence of blood antigens on the surface of red blood cells. In an attempt to address this issue and facilitate blood donations, our project aims to enzymatically convert type B blood into type A, which has successfully been converted into type 0 previously. This reaction is achieved by converting galactose as the terminal sugar of the B antigen into keto-galactose. Using molecular docking simulations with AlphaFold 2 enzyme structures, we screened monooxygenase families to identify enzymes that are potentially capable of catalyzing this conversion. Subsequently, activities of the selected enzymes were to be experimentally validated.
https://teams.igem.org/4835	Biomanufacturing	Microorganisms have a wide range of applications in pharmaceutical, chemical, agricultural and experimental fields. Various metabolic engineering modification strategies and techniques have been used to build E.coli and yeast cell factories. However, microorganisms can fail to survive properly or even die due to veorly alkaline or saline environments during culture and production. To overcome this problem, we collected six strains: Brevibacterium casei G20,Bacillus haynesii P19,Micrococcus luteus R17... which have developed unique salinity and base resistance mechanisms that allow them to grow in 18% NaCl or pH13 environments. We used the Multi-Omics to search for general genetic factors which can enhance microbial salinity and base tolerance. Then,we will use T7 promoter,E. coli to evaluate their performance. Finally, we will get generic "shields" that can use in both Gram-negative and positive bacteria, this will accelerate the development and production of salt-tolerant bacterial resources for industrial applications.
https://teams.igem.org/4836	Therapeutics	IBS-D is a prevalent Functional Gastro-Intestinal Disorder (FGID), affecting approximately 11.2% of the global population and 7.5% of Indians. Stress, unhealthy diet, disrupted gut microbiota, and genetic factors contribute to this syndrome. The rise of urbanization and globalization in developing nations has significantly impacted lifestyle, resulting in disturbed sleep, altered diet patterns, and adverse health effects. IBS-D symptoms include diarrhoea, bloating, disturbed sleep, and nausea. Addressing the root cause, AnthraFelix, a groundbreaking probiotic therapy, targets the dysregulation of the human Serotonin transporter (SERT). Extensive research reveals an accumulation of excess serotonin in the colon of affected individuals. AnthraFelix employs synthetic biology to convert excess serotonin into melatonin. This conversion not only mitigates symptoms but also improves overall quality of life. Melatonin, with its analgesic properties, sleep regulation, and positive impact on gut health, emerges as a promising solution, offering relief and enhancing well-being for those suffering from IBS-D.

This innovative approach offers a non-invasive and cost-effective means of identifying Alzheimer's biomarkers, addressing the critical need for early diagnosis in a rapidly aging global population. By harnessing the unique binding properties of DNA aptamers, we aim to create a highly specific and sensitive diagnostic tool that can detect Alzheimer's-related proteins or genetic markers in saliva. This project seeks to revolutionize Alzheimer's screening by providing a convenient, accessible, and accurate point-of-care solution, with the potential to transform patient outcomes and advance our understanding of this debilitating neurodegenerative disease. Our pursuit aligns with the broader goal of improving the lives of those affected by Alzheimer's and driving forward the field of personalized medicine.
https://teams.igem.org/4839	Therapeutics	Cancer is a malignant disease that poses significant threats to human health. In recent years, immunotherapy approaches such as CAR-T have emerged promising for cancer treatments. However, CAR-T has demonstrated limited effectiveness in treating solid tumors. The use of CAR-M therapy also presents certain limitations. Macrophages exhibit M1/M2 phenotypes. While macrophages in solid tumor are often being "domesticated" into the M2 phenotype. These anti-inflammatory macrophages further promote tumor development and contribute to cancer progression. Considering these challenges, our team has proposed SYN-MACRO (Synthetic engineering macrophage for Hepatocellular Carcinoma therapy) this year. We have engineered macrophages and designed a series of gene circuits to enable them to transition to the M1 phenotype upon tumor recognition, exerting a pro-inflammatory effect, recruiting other immune cells, and suppressing tumor development. We believe that SYN-MACRO holds great promise for offering new insights and treatment approaches for liver cancer and other solid tumors.
https://teams.igem.org/4840	High School	The prevalence of osteoarthritis (OA) is on the rise due to the aging population and the increasing rate of obesity. OA severely impacts the life quality of patients; unfortunately, no effective therapeutic strategy currently exists owing to its complicated pathology. Recent studies have found that the expression of osteoglycin (OGN) was significantly reduced in the articular cartilage of patients with OA. However, the regulatory role of OGN in OA remains unclear. In this project, we used genetic engineering techniques to construct OGN overexpressed and silencing plasmids, and determined the regulatory effect of OGN on the matrix metabolism of chondrocytes. In the future, our research results may help the development of related drugs for the treatment of OA by regulating the expression of OGN, and do our best to contribute to human health.
https://teams.igem.org/4841	High School	Breast cancer is a prevalent form of cancer among women, and among its various subtypes, Triple Negative Breast Cancer stands out due to its early onset, high malignancy grade, and poor prognosis. TNBC is characterized by the absence of estrogen/progesterone receptors (ER/PR) and HER2 protein expression, making it challenging to address using conventional therapies. Our project focuses on advancing cancer treatment strategies, particularly for TNBC. Our objective is to achieve this by genetically modifying a plasmid containing Gox1, which induces the expression of glucose oxidase. This modification aims to inhibit critical pathways (GPX4/GSH and FSP1/CoQ10H2) that play a role in preventing ferroptosis. By disrupting lipid metabolism and redox balance, we anticipate that this approach could potentially impede tumor cell division. The product of our project will take the form of protein drugs by injection or in vivo targeted delivery.

It is effective against cardiovascular disease, wrinkles, hair loss, obesity, and disease. However, only 30%~50% of people can produce (S)-estragenol naturally. Currently, chemical synthesis of (R)/(S)-estragenol mixtures are main procedures used. In our study, (S)-estragenol was heterologously expressed by engineered E. coli, which avoids the use of the expensive inducer ITPG and ensures the purity and production of (S)-estragenol. By regulating the sequence of the ribosome binding site (RBS) of the nar promoter to obtain nar promoter libraries with different translation levels, we obtained RBS libraries for the efficient production of (S)-estragenol. This study will provide a feasible green line for the production of (S)-estragenol.

The pathogen is transmitted from animals to humans. Early symptoms of monkeypox infection include fever, headache, muscle pain, swollen lymph nodes, and tiredness, followed by a blister-like rash. Currently, there is still no effective vaccine or medication to suppress monkeypox. Under this circumstance, our team construct a drug innovation screening platform targeting monkeypox I7L protease, in order to test whether drugs or vaccines are effective. In the future, this kit can be used to more conveniently detect developed drugs or vaccines.

Our team offers a comprehensive solution for a more sustainable future: a dual-pronged approach involving a phytosensor to detect crop phosphate requirements and a smart phosphate biofertilizer. The phytosensor, equipped with a low-phosphate-responsive promoter and a bright GFP reporter, facilitates cost-effective monitoring of phosphate levels in plants. Furthermore, we've engineered bacteria to release insoluble phosphate into the soil by producing gluconic acid in response to plant-released salicylic acid, thereby enhancing phosphate utilization. This innovation holds immense promise in addressing phosphate scarcity and revolutionizing sustainable agriculture practices.
https://teams.igem.org/4845	High School	At present, fermented alcohol is mostly made from corn, which is hydrolyzed into glucose by &#945;-amylase and glucoamylase for fermentation by Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Among them, &#945;-amylase and glucoamylase need to be added exogenously. It is estimated that the cost of an enzyme for producing per ton of alcohol is 100 yuan. If Saccharomyces cerevisiae can autocrine &#945;-amylase and glucoamylase, it will reduce the addition of exogenous enzymes and save the cost of enzymes. In this study, &#945;-amylase and glucoamylase were optimized, and multiple copies were integrated into the chromosome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, following the starch degradation ability of the above strains was tested. The alcohol production ability of the strain fermented sweet potato residue raw starch was tested, and finally, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain secreting &#945;-amylase and glucoamylase was obtained to achieve the goal of saving enzyme dosage.

Conventional natural product screening approachs suffer from high rediscovery and low novelty rates. To address this issue, we focused on antimicrobial peptides which are microbial metabolites with high specificity and low side effects. In this project, we genetically combined nisin with darobactin to generate a fusion peptide with broad-spectrum activity, expressed this engineered peptide with E. coli, and finally verified the structure and activity of them. It will facilitate cost-effective, large-scale production of potent antimicrobial agents. In the future, we will formulate injectable preparations and topical ointments incorporating these peptides to treat bacterial infections in animals and humans. This project represents a promising strategy to combat the pressing challenge of antimicrobial resistance.

The current diagnostic methods of CSF rhinorrhea are relatively time-consuming, complex, and unspecific, which can cause delayed diagnosis and lead to risk of infected. In our project, we use genetic engineering technique to create a complex of Beta-2-transferrin and mCherry to develop the Beta-2-transferrin detection kit. Because of Beta-2-transferrin's high specificity, it would be a detection marker for accurately confirming the presence of CSF. In the future, our project could be a convenient, accurate, fast, and user-friendly kit to help people quickly test for CSF rhinorrhea as a timly warning.
https://teams.igem.org/4848	Climate Crisis	Greenhouse gasses are major contributors to climate change, of which methane and carbon dioxide are some of the most potent. Genetic modification of the methanotroph species, a bacteria able to naturally metabolize methane and carbon dioxide, is a solution to this issue. Considerable work has been dedicated to the genetic engineering of methanotrophs, but a lack in diverse, adaptable, and consistent gene editing remains an issue. Engineering of the Anderson Promoter Series in Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) and Escherichia coli was performed for the series dynamic range of activity with little restrictions on cellular growth. The series led to an inconsistent expression of fluorescent activity for our purposes, resulting in the development of a novel mutagenesis promoter library. The mutagenized promoters were able to successfully generate a full dynamic range of expression, demonstrating an effective biocatalyst with the potential for simultaneous greenhouse gas mitigation and yield of industrially relevant products.

Facing a 32% surge in energy demand by 2040, a shift to sustainable technologies is imperative. Solar energy, though promising, grapples with challenges in silicon-based panel manufacturing. BPVs, while promising, suffer from low conversion efficiencies. Focused on Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, we enhance photosynthetic output with the MTR complex, and salt tolerance. Beyond energy, we repurpose BPV waste into artificial pollen for pollinator-friendly panels, aligning with circular economy principles by enriching essential amino acids, histidine, and lysine in our cyanobacteria waste. Biosafety is paramount, ensured by a zinc-inducible kill switch. Our project strides towards a sustainable energy future, marrying efficient BPVs, circular economy principles, and responsible deployment, addressing climate challenges within a concise framework.
https://teams.igem.org/4850	Foundational Advance	RNA switches are robust and versatile tools in various fields including bioproduction, drug delivery, and disease detection. However, the difficulty in designing the switches hinders its wide applications. A key reason that makes the design process challenging is that the interaction between RNAs are hardly predictable using currently models/tools. Furthermore, there lacks available quality RNA data for developing the models. In our project, we sought to develop OTTER, a tool that is designed to predict effectiveness of RNA switches and develop a new high throughput workflow (SIGNAL) and novel experimentally validated bioparts to facilitate the generation of large RNA library and data. To this end, we built new bioparts and focus on developing deep learning to model RNA-RNA interactions coupled with generative model to suggest RNA switch designs for OTTER. We use RNA switch systems such as STARs and Toehold as our model system.

Probiotics aids corals in fighting environmental stress, but efficient delivery methods aren't available. Cure-all Reefs aims to utilize a coral spray with a unique biofilm-based mechanism for better probiotic adhesion, increasing absorption. We integrated two quorum-sensing mechanisms to regulate biofilm growth and minimize bacteria dispersion beyond the application site. Furthermore, we've developed an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) for precise delivery. An extensive entrepreneurship plan combines the coral spray and AUV together and outlines a service that incentivizes corporations to increase their blue carbon credit investments, which we hope will lead to increased ocean conservation efforts . Our novel probiotic delivery system and all-inclusive service not only aim to address the lack of existing delivery methods, but also strive for a bluer and more sustainable future.
https://teams.igem.org/4853	Therapeutics	Annually, over 14 million cellulitis cases occur in the United States, totaling over $3.7 billion in ambulatory costs. Cellulitis is a common skin infection that occurs in the dermis. Oral and intravenous antibiotics are the standard treatment, because the upper skin layers serve as formidable barriers, rendering it difficult for topical treatments to reach the dermis. Instead, antibiotics travel through the circulatory system, leading to unfavorable interactions with the bodys microbiome, causing patient discomfort and promoting antibiotic resistance. Therefore, we designed a topical treatment, NiSkin, that would traverse skin boundaries and specifically destroy the pathogens causing cellulitis. NiSkin combines the powerful lantibiotic nisin A and skin-penetrating peptide TD-1. NiSkin minimizes side effects and antibiotic resistance through selective activation at the infection site. We successfully co-expressed the nisin precursor conjugated to TD-1 alongside two enzymes that produce active nisin. We observed interactions between the precursor and the enzymes through Western blot.

This involves employing directed evolution and targeted mutagenesis techniques, guided by computational models, plus UV spectroscopy to monitor antibiotic concentrations in liquid samples. The biosafety and economic viability of CADABRA's enzymatic cocktail are paramount, prompting future plans to explore an alternative expression host, Pichia pastoris, for improved characteristics. Overall, CADABRA strives to revolutionize antibiotic removal, ultimately achieving efficient antibiotic hydrolysis and reliable monitoring methods.
https://teams.igem.org/4856	Diagnostics	Breast cancer is a disease in which cells in the breast grow uncontrollably, and it is the second most common cancer among women in Missouri and in the United States. One way to detect instances of breast cancer is to screen for microRNAs associated with breast cancer cell lines, which are present in the urine. We created a device similar to a pregnancy test designed to detect early-onset breast cancer using methods that are easier and less invasive than traditional methods. Our biosensor, called myRNA, contains a Cas13 protein that activates a quencher-fluorophore complex in the presence of miR-424-5p, a miRNA that is positively correlated with incidents of breast cancer.
https://teams.igem.org/4857	Agriculture	Fire blight is highly contagious and difficult to control causing hundreds of acres to be cut down and burned. As antibiotics have been used increasingly over the past century, resistance to these life-saving medicines grows exponentially. Phage therapy offers an exciting alternative. Using phage &#934;Ea104, the phage was attempted to be optimized to attack the fire blight bacteria. Then an essential gene would be deleted to ensure the phage does not attack other microbes in the environment. Viral infection of liquid cultures was effectively induced to generate viral lysate for genomic extraction. The bacteria and phage were not compatible by way of current experimental design methods in terms of safety protocols. This investigation elucidated potential new target sites, replacements for pesticides, and ideas for biocontainment tactics against microbial attacks. Ultimately, cloning techniques, genomic extraction, and the power of homologous recombination have the potential to eliminate Erwinia amylovora as a threat.
https://teams.igem.org/4858	Diagnostics	Antiplatelet medications are a common treatment for patients after experiencing thrombotic events, such as venous thromboembolism or some forms of stroke. Recently, a genetic variant the rs773902 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)was identified that may reduce efficacy of a standard-of-care antiplatelet regimen, aspirin and clopidogrel. This SNP is present in a diverse range of individuals, but is especially prevalent in those of African descent. With alternative medications available that maintain their efficacy in the presence of this SNP, our team sought to develop a point-of-care diagnostic test to detect the rs773902. We propose that physicians use this test to evaluate SNP presence in their patient and make more informed, personalized antiplatelet prescription decisions. Our team employed loop-mediated isothermal amplification and machine learning-generated fluorescent probes to design and make progress towards demonstrating efficacy of our SNP detection platform.

https://teams.igem.org/4860	Diagnostics	Cervical cancer remains a significant health burden, especially in regions with limited access to diagnostic facilities. In this iGEM project, we will be developing an easy-to-use point of care device that can provide a reliable color-based output utilizing red fluorescent protein upon detecting specific miRNAs associated with cervical precancer while leveraging three heavily upregulated microRNAs (miR-21, miR-199a, and miR-155-5p) in the urine of patients. The proposed screening device combines toehold switch technology and RNA synthetic devices. Toehold switches serve as molecular recognition elements, enabling target miRNAs detection with high sensitivity and specificity. We can trigger a visual color response when the target miRNAs are present in the patient's urine. Through careful design and optimization, we aim to produce a low-cost device that requires minimal training to operate, enabling its use in resource-limited areas.
https://teams.igem.org/4861	High School	The current market for COVID-19 treatments is largely dependent on vaccinations and antiviral drugs. The most commonly used vaccination inactivated vaccines and adenovirus vector vaccines. The recombinant protein vaccine we produced is a method of expressing specific proteins in cells using recombinant DNA technology. Compared with traditional inactivated vaccines, recombinant protein vaccines are safer. In the experiment, we used 4 variant strands including Wuhan, Delta, BQ1.1, and XBB.1.5. We combined the DNA of variant strands and pET28a (empty vector) through T4 DNA enzyme ligation to form a recombinant plasmid with a receptor binding domain. We obtained RBD protein by Ni-sepharose purification and then detected the binding ability of the protein to human ACE2 protein by ELISA. We aim to produce a recombinant protein vaccine with S protein as an antigen in E. coli and evaluate its potential as an antigen.
https://teams.igem.org/4862	High School	Our team is dedicated to developing a test kit for evaluating the effectiveness of medicines in combating dengue, a pressing public health issue with millions of viral infections annually and no current effective treatment. The NS3 protein, a versatile 69 kDa protein in the Dengue virus, possesses protease, helicase, and 5-triphosphatase (NTPase) activities. Helicase is crucial for viral replication and represents a promising target for specific antiviral inhibitors. However, the lack of effective in vitro high-throughput screening methods and medications for identifying potential RNA helicase inhibitors necessitates a rapid screening solution. Our project involves analyzing the helicase sequence and employing molecular cloning and protein purification techniques to create a high-throughput in vitro screening method. This method aims to expedite the discovery of helicase inhibitors and contribute to high-throughput drug screening for NS3 helicase, kit development, and medicine discovery in the future.
https://teams.igem.org/4863	High School	Cement is the most widely used construction material, but its high carbon footprint calls for zero-carbon alternatives for sustainable development. Inspired by this year's Turkish-Syrian earthquake, Team Keystone aims to develop a carbon-sequestering, self-healing building material. It utilizes carbonic anhydrase (CA) displayed on the surface of cyanobacteria to convert CO_2 into calcium carbonate, which binds sand aggregates at the nanoscale to increase compressive strength, forming "Biostone". We successfully characterized CA activity and verified its enzymatic activity. Subsequently, we achieved CA surface display by displaying Spytag on surface-exposed structures on Synechocystis PCC 6803, SLP and PilA1, to bind to CA-SpyCatcher complex via covalent bonding, and indirectly validated functional surface display via GFP. Finally, using 3D models, we encapsulated engineered Synechocystis PCC 6803, CA, and sand within a sodium alginate hydrogel matrix to produce "Biostone", paving the way for future production of more advanced bio-based construction materials.
https://teams.igem.org/4864	Agriculture	Agriculture is an essential industry that provides the world with food and sustenance. The presence of agricultural pests, which can cause significant damage to crops and reduce yields, is one of the challenges that farmers face. Another emerging environmental concern is the proliferation of microplastics in agricultural fields. Microplastics have been a global environmental concern owing to their widespread pollution, which may pose risks to food security and human health once they enter agricultural soils. Thus, in our project, Bacillus megaterium was engineered to effectively produce extracellular laccase and crystal proteins with the help of an inducible bi-directional circuit. A kill switch was also built to initiate suicide once the engineered bacteria were released from the desired environment for biosafety. Our project provides a novel method to kill pests and degrade microplastics simultaneously in the agricultural field.

Spider silk is being considered as a potential biomaterial for various biomedical applications. However, farming spiders and extracting silk from them on industrial scale is nearly impossible. Synthetic biology techniques can help produce spider silks recombinantly in different hosts, allowing for the creation of various functional materials depending on the desired application. In this project, we constructed a prokaryotic expression system to express recombinant spider silk protein (R) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) fusion protein for the purpose of rapid wound healing. The promising results obtained from this strategy support the manufacturing of EGF-spider silk-based biomaterials to promote the repair of skin cell damage. This gel-like material holds potential for use in wound dressing or as artificial skin.

This biocontainment system functions as a conditional kill switch, reliant on the concentration of AHL signal molecule from a bacterial quorum sensing. We have also strived to present the prospective applications of our biocontainment system. Our specific focus has been on co-culture applications for wastewater treatment, as demonstrated through our design of the bio-reactor. Our overarching objective is to harness the Quorum sensing biocontainment system to ensure versatile co-culturing of engineered eukaryotic cells and bacteria. In doing so, we aspire to contribute to the progress of synthetic biology within South Korea.
https://teams.igem.org/4867	Bioremediation	Fungi have been identified to possess plastic degradation capabilities via enzymes.They are sustainable and cost-effective alternative. Given that Hong Kong's second largest municipal waste is plastics, our team aims to alleviate the burden of limited landfill space by developing a more sustainable, efficient, and cost-effective method using laccase, lignin peroxidase (LiP) and manganese peroxidase (MnP). Our method involves inserting a specific gene into optimal plasmid that facilitate production of enzymes. After increasing the efficiency of gene expression, optimal plasmid will be transformed in DH5 E.coli, incubated and secreted for subsequent downstream processes. Since we are investigating two plastic components, per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substancestu (PFA) and polyethylene (PE), degradation efficiency will be determined by measuring their activity in guaiacol oxidation under different temperature and pH. Along with these results, we will perform assay where different enzyme concentrations digest different molecular weights of the mixed waste to model the plastic degradation efficiency.
https://teams.igem.org/4868	Bioremediation	PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) pollution has garnered significant media attention in Denmark, due to its detrimental impact on groundwater and human health. A primary challenge lies in degrading PFAS, given the highly stable carbon-fluorine bonds present in their structure. The project aims to enhance the enzymatic activity of dehalogenases isolated from Delfia acidovorans for the degradation of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). Utilizing a fluoride-sensitive riboswitch linked to the expression of green fluorescent protein, we can effectively measure enzymatic activity and thus assess the enzymatic activity of the optimized dehalogenases. Through computational modeling, we have predicted the protein structures and optimized binding pockets for PFOA and other PFAS. These predictions were compared to variants from a dehalogenase mutant library generated using error-prone PCR. Collaboration with local water treatment facilities has tailored our project to real-life applications, paving the way for potential advancements in PFAS bioremediation strategies.

https://teams.igem.org/4871	Environment	&#12288;Japan is surrounded by the sea, and most of its trade is dependent on marine transportation. The problem of marine biofouling has become an issue in this maritime transportation. Marine biofouling causes increased vessel weight and increased resistance to water currents as it adheres to vessel surfaces. This directly leads to increased fuel consumption, which in turn causes global warming, air pollution, and economic problems. &#12288;On the other hand, the chemicals that have been used so far to deter the attachment of attached organisms have a negative impact on marine ecosystems. &#12288;By the way, some marine organisms are known to produce substances that inhibit the attachment of attached organisms. These substances are considered environmentally friendly because they are naturally occurring. Therefore, we, iGEM Tsukuba, aim to solve the complex environmental problems caused by the attached organisms by using synthetic biology to mass-produce these substances in E. coli.

Alzheimer's disease, the commonest cause of dementia, is a growing global health concern with huge implications for individuals and society. For these reasons, we set up Alzheimer's Assistance (AAA) in order to make a contribution to solving Alzheimer's disease. We designed a series of gene experiments related to &#945;2A-AR protein synthesis screened for proteins that affect 2A-AR transport within cells, and used the RUSH-BRET method to detect whether these proteins can affect 2A-AR transport, further detecting whether these proteins are related to Alzheimer's disease and discovering new targets for the development of anti-Alzheimer's disease drugs, which is to find a direction for developing Alzheimer's disease treatment.

https://teams.igem.org/4879	Climate Crisis	We aim to produce sustainable aviation fuel in the model oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica. We cloned the thioesterases JcFATA and JcFATB from Jatropha curcas heterologously into the yeast to alter its fatty acid profile to emulate the composition of Jatropha seeds. We chose Jatropha because SAFs based on Jatropha oil have been shown to have superior properties as compared to conventional jet fuel while also having lower CO2 emissions. Further we cloned a photodecarboxylase from Chlorella variabilis, CvFAP, which converts our fatty acids into hydrocarbons, thus simplifying chemical hydroprocessing and making it eco-friendly. In silico, we created a kinetic model which models the fatty acid production pathway follwoing glycolysis in yeast. Through mutation-based specificity analysis, we increased the specificity of the natural efflux pump of Y. lipolytica for hydrocarbon efflux. Finally, we modelled probable interactions between the thioesterases and the native FAS complex of the yeast through molecular docking.

However, traditional methods of producing aromatic substances, such as terpenes, are often both complex and environmentally damaging. Therefore, we endeavored to discover a synthetic approach to produce these aroma substances, replacing traditional processes and making them directly usable in daily life. We finally decided to use cyanobacteria as a chassis. Through photosynthesis, our engineering cyanobacteria can utilize carbon dioxide and sunlight to produce these terpenes. Following we are committed to developing our scent-producing cyanobacteria into bioreactors that can meet people's daily needs.

Recognizing the urgent need for a more effective solution, our iGEM team is passionately committed to developing an innovative approach that will substantially reduce methane emissions from dairy digesters. Our focus lies in adapting the plasmid sequence for Methane Monooxygenase (MMO), an enzyme that is able to convert methane into methanol, to suit the specific characteristics of E. coli, our chosen host organism. Optimizing the plasmid sequence is crucial to achieve high-level expression of MMO in E. coli.

Butyl butyrates low viscosity and low carbon emission make it a biofuel with a high potential of alleviating the above problems. We genetically engineered C. tyrobutyricum to enable efficient and large-scale synthesis of butyl butyrate. We optimize metabolic pathways through three strategies to further reinforce the synthesis of butyrate and butanol, including precursor accumulation, inhibition of byproducts, and increasing mass transfer efficiency as well as promoter engineering. The results showed that yields of butyl butyrate can be improved to varying degrees, which indicated that it is a promising way to improve the biosynthesis efficiency of butyl butyrate.

In China, microbial carbon emissions account for 7% of the total, and most of the carbon emissions generated by microorganisms come from sugar degradation. Carbon sequestration is conducive to reducing carbon emissions. This project attempts to introduce a highly active phosphoketolase (F/Xpk) gene into the heterotrophic C. tyrobutyricum, to construct an artificial NOG pathway with high metabolic flux. Compared with the native EMP pathway, this alternative pathway metabolizes glucose into acetyl CoA without carbon loss. We further tried to improve the F/Xpk expression by promoter engineering and ASR. Besides, we found that this engineered strain has a higher ability to utilize cheaper carbon sources. The approach used in this project can be further adapted to a variety of strains with similar metabolic carbon emission issues, thereby contributing to the reduction of global carbon emissions.

Firstly, sgRNA oligos targeting the IbGBSSI gene was designed and annealed, and was inserted into the plasmid psgR-Cas9-At to construct the backbone vector, which was combined with the binary vector pCAMBIA1301s to obtain the expression vector. This knockout construct was transformed later into embryogenic calli of sweet potato and then IbGBSSI-deficient mutants were received after further culturing and screening. After detections of the storage root starch of the mutants, it showed that the total starch content in the storage roots of the mutants was hardly changed, but the proportion of amylose was significantly reduced to between 0.5% and 0.8% while it was 23.33% of the wild-type. It indicated that high-purity amylopectin can be produced by these engineered sweet potato lines and used for performance starch-based biodegradable plastic production.

We inserted MTF-1 gene driven by UAS and Hid gene driven by MRE in Drosophila S2 cells, respectively. These two transgenic Drosophila lines interbreed and the offspring with both MTF-1 and Hid genes cross with the Drosophila line with genotype GMR-GAL4 or Vg-GAL4 or ptc-GAL4 which express GAL4 during eye/wing development. In this way, we constructed three Drosophila lines with genotype UAS-MTF-1;MRE-Hid/GMR-GAL4, UAS-MTF-1;MRE-Hid/Vg-GAL4, and UAS-MTF-1;MRE-Hid/ptc-GAL4 which express MTF-1 during eye/wing development due to the GAL4-UAS system. In response to heavy metals in the environment, MTF-1 is activated, binds to MRE and activates Hid expression, leading to apoptosis in the developing eyes/wings. Thus, in the first generation within 5-10 days, these lines show abnormally small eye/wing sizes observable by naked eyes. The system can be used for heavy metal pollution monitoring.

Current detection methods for P. aeruginosa take between 24-48 hours through use of swab swab samples and plate cultures. During this time, the infection worsens and forms a biofilm, making the infection increasingly difficult to eradicate. Therefore, a more rapid sense-and-treat system would improve the treatment of these infected wounds. We utilize the redox properties of pyocyanin, a key biomarker of P. aeruginosa, to create an electrochemical biosensor powered by enzyme fuel cells. We use the enzyme pyrroloquinoline quinone glucose dehydrogenase (PQQGDH) that powers the enzyme fuel cell reaction. The use of curcumin, a natural compound of turmeric, as a treatment molecule through a pH sensitive hydrogel is also explored through mathematical modeling.

Our team has developed a method to modify HepG2 liver cells to be able to detect cholesterol levels and switch cholesterol synthesis on or off in response to cholesterol levels. This approach utilizes an engineered synthetic cholesterol regulatory circuit that is grown in E. coli K-12 and then transfected into HepG2 cells. This is a two-step circuit containing a cholesterol biosensor and a cholesterol regulator. The liver cells modified by this circuit are able to detect changes in cholesterol levels and regulate cholesterol synthesis in response to cholesterol levels.

So far, no method on acne prevention is reported. Here, we invented a new L-RCA based method, BS test kit, to find out the healthy people with potential acne vulgaris in 10 minutes. People who had the acne warning will undergo a certain treatment with BS cleanser. BS cleanser contained 3 key elements: a Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) fix protein named capsular antigen fragment 1- antimicrobial peptide infused (Caf1-AMP), and a specified P. acnes killing protein named TurboID-signal peptide. We also added Glutathione Peroxidase 7 to the BS cleanser to eliminate the reactive oxygen species and protect the skin cells from oxidative damage. In summary, we offer a solution for predicting and preventing the growth of P. acne in 'healthy' individuals before acne happens.

The main culprits behind this pollution are textile industries and car workshops, discharging hazardous organometallic compounds. Extensive research has revealed a critical flaw in current bioremediation systems: their inability to effectively eliminate toxic organometallic compounds, known to be more harmful than other metal forms. In response, we present an innovative solution called Lichenysina biosurfactant that forms micelles, effectively trapping and facilitating the effortless removal of these compounds. Through the implementation of synthetic biology, our goal is to engineer a modified version of E. coli capable of producing Lichenysin. This approach not only addresses the limitations of existing bioremediation systems but also mitigates concerns regarding potential pathogenicity associated with the native strain.

Our goal is to develop a cheaper, safer, and more efficient diagnostic method for endometriosis using blood-miRNA biomarkers and a CRISPR-dCas12 detection system, which would be a significant step towards making this essential diagnostic tool available to people in regions of the world where labs are scarce and less well-equipped. An earlier diagnosis, has the potential to improve the quality of life for affected women. It is also worth mentioning that this diagnostic method can be modified and applied to other diseases in the future.

https://teams.igem.org/4901	High School	PET hydrolase (PETase) and mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate hydrolase (MNETase) are known to synergistically convert PET into its monomeric building blocks. Our team developed six bacterial expression vectors with PETase and six dual expression plasmids containing PETase and MHETase enzymes for optimal PET degradation using Pseudomonas putida, targeting scalability in PET recycling plants. Due to time constraints, we focused on comparing the mutant form of BBa_J435500_W159H_S238F enzyme with wildtype PETase, using p-nitrophenyl butyrate (pNPB) as a PET analog. Under conditions of 2500 nanomolar pNPB, pH 9.0, and 30°C, the modified PETase's activity exceeded the wildtype's by seven-fold. This highlights the potential of BBa_J435500_W159H_S238F for developing PET recycling strategies. Data from iGEM 2019 in Toronto further confirms our results indicating the superior performance of our construct, highlighting the critical role of enzyme modification in combating the plastic pollution problem.

Additionally, they explored various promoters, signal peptides, and enhancers to enhance the breakdown of PET plastics. At the same time, the method introduced 1,2 dioxygenase to transform degradation-generated TPA into protocatechuic acid PCA, thus enabling Rhodococcus rhodococcus to effectively use PET and accumulate microbial lipids. This allows for microbial oil production through plastic degradation, offering a potential solution to address the global energy crisis.
https://teams.igem.org/4904	High School	Optogenetics was achieved for the biosynthetic process's control and extended to cancer treatment development. CRY2/CIB1 interactions are the most common blue light-dependent interaction. In this experiment, we aim to improve this method and hopefully, it will contribute to improving cancer treatment. We construct a new interaction by attaching protein GFP on preexisting interactions called CRY2/SPA1 using the construction of recombinant plasmid and yeast mating. The further interaction we made is called CRY2(GFP)/SPA1. Later, we used beta-galactosidase to test and compare the strength and sensitivity with CRY2/CIB1. For further development, the new blue light-dependent interaction can be applied to a novel cancer technique: CAR-T. By importing the new interaction to CAR-T, doctors can control the activity of the T cell by simply turning off and on the blue light. We believe the little blue light could progress considerably by inventing this unique interaction.

Current treatments aim at relieving the symptoms of the disease. However, those are not specific enough, cause many side effects or are very expensive. The TU-Eindhoven team wants to tackle this challenge by developing an affordable, safe, targeted microbe-based therapy that works locally in the bowel. With the use of elastin-like polypeptides, the TU-Eindhoven team modify E. coli bacteria so that they become unable to divide by forming a hydrogel inside the cell, making them safer for ingestion. Simultaneously, they will produce the anti-inflammatory protein IL-10 to treat symptoms and reduce inflammation locally in the intestine. The product is called cELPro and will be used as a probiotic pill that patients will take regularly. In short, the TU-Eindhoven team creates micrometre-sized drug factories that relieve many problems that IBD patients experience.

In light of this prevailing issue, we used genetic engineering techniques to create bacteria that overexpress enzymes, namely Fat-1 and ELOVL-5, which play important role in Omega-3 synthesis. Through the innovative application of genetic engineering techniques, our project aims to revolutionize the way Omega-3 fatty acids are produced and integrated into the human diet.

https://teams.igem.org/4911	Diagnostics	CRISPR-Cas technologies hold immense potential for next-generation gene therapy. However, because of the complex genome structure and potential irreparable consequences, these technologies must be thoroughly tested. To address this, we propose a universal cellular biosensor capable of rapidly and accurately assessing the activity of genome editing systems without the need for complex sequencing. We did a comprehensive analysis of existing genome editing systems to understand their strengths and limitations. We then carefully select key genetic components to create a biosensor system that can detect and monitor editing system activity. This molecular biosensor operates on genetic chains, allowing specific monitoring of individual components. Our ultimate goal is to develop a genetic chain capable of detecting the activity of editing systems and evaluate it's performance in vivo using model cellular systems. In perspective, this biosensor will enhance the safety and stability, aiding in the selection of optimal editing systems for specific cases.
https://teams.igem.org/4912	Biomanufacturing	Hydroxytyrosol (HT) is a polyphenol found in olives, known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. However, its large-scale application is limited due to the high production costs associated with traditional plant extraction and chemical synthesis methods. Microbial production offers a promising alternative but faces challenges such as low strain tolerance, complex synthesis pathways, and oxidative degradation. In this work, we focus on establishing and optimizing the HT production pathway in Bacillus licheniformis, which exhibits high robustness. Through protein engineering of ketoacid decarboxylase, metabolic pathway optimization, and screening of limiting factors, we have enhanced microbial efficiency. Subsequently, we further refined the scale-up culture processes to boost HT yield. Leveraging synthetic biology, we aim to achieve a more cost-effective and sustainable production of hydroxytyrosol, unlocking its potential applications ranging from cardiovascular drugs to cosmetics, functional foods, and nutraceuticals.

We developed a novel screening method by utilizing Loop-Initiated RNA Activator (LIRA) OR Gate system to detect miR-21 and/or miR-92a as early biomarkers of CRC assembled within endogenous pMUT1 plasmid that were engineered into Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) probiotic chassis. The modified EcN will then colonize the cancer tissue and will express aeBlue chromoprotein reporter when there is/are biomarker(s), coloring the feces blue. We optimize LIRA through various models including approached ON-OFF metrics, multivariate regression to get the best LIRA structurally, and kinetic model to obtain more expected visible reporter duration stability. In the future, It will be formulated as capsules that can be easily consumed as probiotics, this novel approach will ensure a safer and highly accessible early screening for CRC, especially in rural areas.

Our team has engineered Escherichia coli to sense bioavailable phosphate in soil and provide a colorimetric readout of concentration. Our goal is to be able to measure the concentration of phosphate using nutrient-specific promoters controlling the expression of Beta-lactamase. Beta-lactamase cleaves nitrocefin which causes a color change. We aim to provide laboratory service for agriculturists that is cheaper and has the ability to detect bioavailable phosphate in soil to aid in proper soil fertilization.

They also yield valuable products such as honey and beeswax, integral to human livelihoods. Unfortunately, honey bee populations are globally declining, influenced by factors like pathogens, climate shifts, and excessive pesticide use. Among these challenges, the Deformed wing virus (DWV), primarily transmitted by mites, is particularly widespread and detrimental, causing the death of millions of bees annually. The Estonia-TUIT team aims to suppress viral protein expression within bee cells by inducing RNA interference response. Our strategy involves genetically modified yeast cells producing short hairpin RNAs, which inhibit DWV gene expression. To deliver these shRNAs into bee cells, we intend to either feed our modified yeast to bees or directly inject shRNA-containing extracts into honeycombs. This approach aims to boost the bee's inherent RNA interference immune response, protecting them from the virus's harmful effects.

https://teams.igem.org/4919	Agriculture	Bovine milk production significantly contributes to global warming, largely due to cow methane production. This research begins to solve this problem by using the more sustainable organism, soybeans, to generate a genetically equivalent form of whey protein found in bovine milk. Soybean fields use less land, energy, and produce fewer greenhouse gasses than milk farms, making them more sustainable for milk production. This research uses synthetic biology techniques to bioengineer the whey proteins alpha-lactalbumin and beta-lactoglobulin in soybeans. This is done by engineering a DNA plasmid containing the alpha-lactalbumin or beta-lactoglobulin coding region, a promoter and terminator specific to soybeans, and a GUS reporter gene. This plasmid is then transformed into Agrobacterium which will naturally insert the synthetic plasmid into a soybean seed. The transfected soybean seed will then have the machinery to produce whey proteins. Producing whey proteins in soybeans is the first step to sustainably produce bovine milk.

To fill this gap, we aim to install the POAP cycle, a carbon-sequestration cycle, into the minimal cell. The simplicity of this cells genome affords us clarity in how the POAP cycle affects biological functions. We use the built-in Cre-Lox system and the ease of engineering functions (e.g. the conversion of fixed CO2 to valuable compounds) of the cells genome, to genetically-build and tune the POAP cycle. We additionally report successful evolution of a thermal-resistant minimal cell strain that thrives above 44°C, optimizing the activities of the POAP enzymes.

Biogenic amines are substances that include nitrogen. Biogenic amines can make people get headaches and stomachaches and also nervous. The available technology can decrease the concentration of biogenic amines but will influence the flavor. So, our topic is how we can build a recombinant yeast that allows the engagement of biogenic amine to decline and not affect the taste. We chose pAO815 as a vector. And we use the gene Aoc&#8544; and gene FAD to construct the plasmid. Aoc&#8544; is ammonia oxidase, which can catalyze and split the biogenic amine. FAD can help the plasmid expression better.

Research has shown that the composition of the gut microbiome, can help in the prevention or exasperation of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBDs). New studies have specifically linked IBD development to gut dysbiosis, a changed gut microbiome composition associated with a reduction in beneficial bacteria and associated compounds. A crucial component of a healthy gut microbiome are short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Alterations in SCFA ratios have been directly associated with IBDs. Our goal is to develop an early detection system that would enable people to check for patterns of dysbiosis linked to IBDs in order to discover autoimmune inflammation early. This would allow for prompt intervention and prevent inflammatory damage to the gut which leads to the severe quality of life reduction that many patients report.

PQQ, a highly valuable antioxidant, has been shown in previous research to enhance mitochondrial biogenesis, metabolic rate, and memory. However, feeding such an expensive compound to insects is impractical. In this iGEM project, we have introduced PQQ biosynthetic pathway into Bacillus subtilis natto. We then fed the supernatant to our model honeybees, Apis mellifera. In brief, we used electroporation to transform the plasmid and treated the bees with the supernatant. For the bees, we adopted a buffet-style feeding approach on the first day with PQQ, followed by continuous monitoring of the bees subsequently. The results revealed that the effects of PQQ on bees disappeared by the third day post-feeding but could be restored through refeeding. Furthermore, the experiments showed that PQQ significantly improved the flight capabilities and memory of the bees.

Yeast cell factory has been widely applied in practical production. However, multiple stress challenges(such as high temperature and extreme pH environments) during the fermentation process significantly reduce its availability. Enhancing its tolerance can substantially reduce production costs and energy consumption, expanding the application scope of yeast cell factories. Polyamines, a class of widely distributed organic compounds derived from primary metabolic pathways, are associated with many stress-related phenotypes. Inspired by the relationship between polyamines and stress tolerance in plants and extremophiles, in YEAST PATRONUS, we utilized polyamine metabolism to construct a thermotolerant yeast cell factory. This involved various methods, including exogenous addition, endogenous expression, and exogenous expression, to validate our hypothesis. We achieved the production of various polyamines and conducted a preliminary evaluation of their thermo-tolerance capabilities.

To date, an automatic plasmid system in which growth rate can be reliably predicted and instigated has not yet been developed. Such a system would have several useful applications in bioproduction, co-culturing and directed evolution. Thus, our goal is to create a system that allows for Escherichia coli growth rate to be a genetically programmable parameter. To this end we have: developed a set of plasmid constructs that characterise bacteriophage growth inhibitor genes in E. coli, delineated a protocol with which to tune these growth slowers to an inducible promoter of choice; and begun to develop a multiplexed automated turbidostat to ease the gathering of necessary data. Simultaneously, significant mathematical modelling was performed to ensure that future iGEM teams have all the tools and understanding necessary to reliably control microbial growth.

However, its pungent odors, mainly caused by alpha-pinene, poses a threat to the health of oil painting practitioners. Our project hopes to construct engineering bacteria to degrade alpha-pinene, the main component of turpentine. The degradation process includes two parts: an improved alpha-pinene oxidation system and an alpha-pinene oxide lyses system. Firstly, exogenous alpha-pinene monooxygenase was introduced into E. coli to facilitate the oxidation of alpha-pinene into alpha-pinene oxidate. Then, alpha-pinene oxidate can be converted into isonovalal by E. coli introduced with alpha-pinene oxide lyase. We intend to apply our engineering bacteria to the real world. Therefore, a product in the form of biological air purifier was designed. We hope that our engineering bacteria can solve the problem of turpentine's pungent odors and provide an environmentally friendly future for oil painting.

Currently no effective treatments exist to halt or reverse AD progression. This project develops a novel biotherapeutic to delay AD onset by engineering the probiotic bacterium Clostridium butyricum to produce the neuroprotective metabolite butyrate. Using a two-plasmid CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system delivered via bacterial spores to the gut, C. butyricum is optimized to synthesize and secrete elevated butyrate. Through the gut-brain axis, butyrate confers neuroprotection by reducing oxidative stress, neuronal apoptosis, and neuroinflammation in the brain. Quantum Machine learning is used to identify the Mild Cognitive Impairment stage to administer the synthetic biotic and classify possible drug targets. For human practices, we authored a neuroethical report examining the ethics and responsibility of genetic Engineering and our project.

It employs synthetic biology to develop a fusion protein that targets NPC1L1, a lipid transporter protein found in the lining of the small intestines. NPC1L1 is involved in absorption of both cholesterol, and saturated fats which are used in the downstream synthesis of cholesterol. Our fusion protein consists of an Immunoglobulin G fragment, a linker, and a hedgehog family protein fragment bound to cholesterol, which is meant to inhibit NPC1L1 by blocking the site of cholesterol intake, preventing absorption. Side effects of many medications arise when the medication ends up in unintended locations, that is why CholesterLock is designed to be completely contained to the gastrointestinal tract. This innovative approach holds potential to be a highly specific, cost-effective, and low side-effect alternative to traditional medication.

(S)-equol, an isoflavandiol estrogen produced in the human gut microbiome, has been found to help alleviate post-menopausal symptoms with minimal health risks. However, its effectiveness in the human gut is limited by its low production levels. The production of (S)-equol is dependent on the bioavailability of its precursor daidzein, an isoflavone derived from soy. We aimed to develop a heterologous host for daidzein production in order to improve downstream (S)-equol production. We reconstructed the de novo biosynthetic pathway for daidzein production in E. coli through the modular screening of gene homologs of the seven genes involved in converting the phytochemical precursor p-coumaric acid into daidzein. We then attempted to optimize (S)-equol biosynthesis conditions in which the daidzein pathway will be integrated into.

In this project, our team used two reporter genes (GFP, RFP) along with the PyeaR promoter to allow the usage as an Arduino sensor. The red color is controlled by the yeaR promoter, which enables the expression of mScarlet, and the green color is controlled by the amount of mScarlet produced, other polycistronic-arranged repressors and Lon protease. When exposed to nitrate, the yeaR promoter is activated to form the repressor and Lon protease along with mScarlet, and the expression of mVenus is suppressed by the repressor. The mVenus quickly decomposes by the Lon protease, changing the color of the bead into red. The sensor contains the beads that are made by modified E. coli bacteria having chromatic colors green and red, dependent on the amount of fluorescence expressed under UV light.

https://teams.igem.org/4951	Environment	Antibiotics have long been the cornerstone of treating bacterial infections and, at times, are the only effective care option available. Rising antibiotic use in developing nations has rapidly reduced the effectiveness of conventional antibiotics and led to a rise in antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB). Common approaches for combating ARB include novel antibiotics and bacteriophages. However, there is currently no method to eliminate ARB that reduces disruption to native microbiota and ecosystems, minimizes human health risks, and does not readily broaden the antibiotic resistance spectrum. Our project, Antibiotic Resistance Control (ARC), achieves sub-host specificity in bacteriophages, enabling precise targeting of ARB in a diverse range of environments. We created this functional killing response by integrating synthetic RNA switches to enhance target precision and control lytic activity. By limiting phage integration and lytic activity to antibiotic resistance gene mRNA presence, we effectively safeguard symbiotic microbiomes without expanding the range of antibiotic resistance.

Caused by the Fusarium oxysporum pathogenic fungus, it clogs the plant's xylem vessels, leading to water and nutrient deprivation, defoliation, and plant death. Our solution involves genetically modifying bacteria for early detection of F. oxysporum. A genetic circuit with a fusaric acid inducible promoter is activated by fusaric acid produced by the fungus. Upon detection, bacteria produces AHL through LuxI protein to communicate via quorum sensing. Other bacteria were modified to form complex with the AHL and produce more AHL through the LuxI/LuxR complex.

While treatments and medications exist, there's insufficient focus on prevention and everyday mental health care. To address this issue, we're leveraging saffron, a flower cultivated in Japan for centuries. Saffron contains three antidepressant compounds, which we aim to produce using synthetic biology in E. coli. These compounds will be incorporated into affordable cookies to support effective mental health. Additionally, we've developed an innovative approach to overcome regulatory constraints on genetically engineered organisms. We've successfully disrupted the chromosomes of E. coli, halting their growth safely. This technology is applicable to most bacteria, offering a groundbreaking solution for various iGEM projects. "Saffrocure" is a groundbreaking project that revolutionizes depression prevention and treatment through synthetic biology while also enhancing the practicality of implementing synthetic biology-based ideas in society.

https://teams.igem.org/4958	Environment	The increasing population, coupled with rising living standards, has led to a dramatic rise in the production and consumption of chicken meat. In 2023 alone, global chicken meat production is estimated to be 103.4 million tons, generating about 8.38 million tons of feather waste. Feather, made up of keratin, is recalcitrant to natural degradation and remains stable in the environment for 5-7 years, during which it causes a host of environmental and health hazards. The structural recalcitrance of keratin is due to the extensive disulphide crosslinks. Thus, the key to feather degradation lies in reducing these bonds. The enzyme cysteine dioxygenase inherent to Bacillus subtilis enables the secretion of sulphite to facilitate this reduction of disulphide bonds. Genes coding for cysteine dioxygenase, potent keratinases and a functional kill switch will be cloned to generate recombinant Bacillus subtilis. These bacteria will degrade feathers inside a fermentor efficiently and safely.

https://teams.igem.org/4960	Therapeutics	In the past 50 years, significant progress has been made in managing diseases closely linked to excess body weight. However, treating obesity itself has been challenging, with medications often providing inadequate efficacy and potential safety concerns. Here, we demonstrate a novel synthetic biology-inspired therapeutic nanomachine to reduce excess body fat by effectively delivering Uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) into white adipose cells. Our results show that the engineered syringe-like Photorhabdus Virulence Cassette (PVC) nanoparticles could be loaded with UCP1 and effectively assembled in E. coli. The UCP1-loading PVCs could effectively inject UCP1 into mammalian cells in a target-dependent manner, which then induces an overall increase in cell metabolic rate. Our approach offers an exciting and promising way to reduce body fat, which can help prevent obesity-related diseases.

https://teams.igem.org/4963	Therapeutics	Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 82% of all cancer cases in India and has an extremely poor prognosis. A characteristic specific to solid tumors is Antigen-Heterogeneity on the surface. This property neutralizes antigen-specific treatments, like Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) - T therapy. To mitigate this problem, we propose a treatment which targets the adhesion mechanism of the tumor and disintegrates it. STAT3 inhibition, which focuses on this property, is thus exploited to aid CAR T-cell treatment. This treatment is centered on the drug Honokiol which inhibits STAT3. The drug is extracellularly displayed on T-cells via a modified Cannabinoid Receptor 1 (CB1) construct, and is to be released by the CB1 antagonist AM-6538 near the tumor site, thus minimizing side-effects of both CAR T and the drug. The treatment therefore expands the utility of CAR T therapy while also introducing genetically modified vectors as agents of drug delivery.

While there are existing topical treatments, their effectiveness is often unsatisfactory. Therefore, we aim to utilize synthetic biology techniques to enhance E. coli Nissle 1917 for acne treatment. For the inflammatory stage of acne, we have engineered the expression of FadL/FadD metabolic pathway proteins to absorb and break down long-chain fatty acids(LCFAs) on the face, reducing inflammation. We have also incorporated silver ions to eliminate P. acne. For the recovery stage, we introduced plasmids for the exogenous secretion of Epidermal Growth Factor(EGF) to enable E. coli to heal scars. This innovative approach efficiently addresses multiple acne-related issues all at once, and it has been integrated into a double-stage patch named Acnedote, which holds great promise for effective acne treatment.

It plays crucial roles in iron transportation and immunity of neonates. Currently, possible solutions for children without direct access to human lactoferrin are substitution with other mammalian lactoferrin, extracted human lactoferrin from breast milk and recombinant production using eukaryotes. Each one has their own issues. Prokaryotic production of human lactoferrin has been largely inefficient due to the proteins strong bactericidal abilities. We have expressed human lactoferrin in E. coli in different conditions.We found patterns indicating beneficial effects of the added ions on bacterial survival on top of producing functioning proteins. This points us farther along the way of finding a more efficient and economically friendly method of human lactoferrin production through prokaryotic expression under optimum conditions.

This phenomenon threatens marble monuments around the world, therefore its limitation is a matter of paramount importance. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a diverse class of amphipathic molecules, produced by many tissues and cell types in a variety of invertebrates, plant and animal. AMPs enter the pores of the cell membrane, thereby damaging and killing microorganisms. The aim of this study is to evaluate their activity as key components of a biological biocide. The experimental procedures involve the transformation of E. coli strains with recombinant plasmids containing the desired nucleotide sequence of antimicrobial peptides. After isolation, characterization of the expression and purity of the peptides under study, their efficacy is assessed on gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, as well as fungi and viruses found in marbles.
https://teams.igem.org/4974	Village	Our motivation was to create an inexpensive and non-invasive aptamer-based approach to assess saliva samples to detect acute stress by clinicians in order to diagnose patients. Through collaboration, we obtained labeled DNA probes with specificity to alpha-amylase. We used an EMSA to visualize the binding of those probes to our protein. We also began work on synthesizing a plasmid to express alpha-amylase in the lab for future experiments. We were able to show a specific interaction between the alpha-amylase and aptamer complex within a polyacrylamide gel. The interaction of the protein-DNA complex traveled a shorter distance versus probe and protein alone. The study shows that synthetic DNA oligonucleotides make for an equally efficient method to detect alpha-amylase versus the traditional ELISA antibody. In the future, we will apply this method to human samples via saliva collection which is less invasive than a blood draw.

The pathophysiology of sepsis is inextricably linked to bone marrow, as the hematopoietic niche controls the proliferation of myeloid and lymphoid progenitor cells in peripheral blood and boosts local immune response. Tracking the progression of sepsis and predicting the clinical outcome is difficult, as no model exists that accurately mimics human physiology or immune trends. In response, the UFlorida iGEM Team developed a multifaceted approach combining an in-vitro bone marrow organoid and an in-silico model. Our in-vitro model in combination with our in-silico model can produce trends that recapitulate the sepsis progression in a patient.

Our research presents a sustainable solution: converting algae waste into valuable alginate oligosaccharide biofertilizers. Traditional degradation methods face drawbacks like environmental pollution and energy consumption. To overcome these challenges, we employ genetic engineering to express alginate lyase, key enzyme for alginate degradation. We combine it with cellulase to enhance efficiency and solubility, ensuring thorough degradation while prioritizing sustainability. For biosafety, we introduce a lysis gene to break down E. coli cells used in genetic engineering, ensuring biosafety during alginate degradation. Alginate oligosaccharides bolster crop stress resistance, promote growth, enhance quality, and increase yields, offering sustainable agriculture benefits. Our gene circuit's arabinose-inducible promoter allows controlled gene expression, ensuring both innovation and responsibility in our approach.

At first we used the enzyme urease to break down urea to produce NH3 and CO2. the alkaline environment created by the NH3 promotes Ca2+ to combine with carbonate to form calcium carbonate precipitation. We then proceeded to add a CspA cold-inducible promoter to ensure that the urease could be expressed at low temperatures, and finally we added biopolysaccharides in order to improve the toughness as well as the durability of the calcium carbonate precipitates.

https://teams.igem.org/4999	Foundational Advance	Research and diagnostic tools for high-throughput molecular detection can typically target only a single analyte or class of analytes at a time. One approach to addressing this shortcoming is suspending cell-free expression (CFE) detection systems in aqueous two-phase system (ATPS) droplets, then spatially assembling different protocell droplets into an assay capable of detecting diverse analytes. However, this approach necessitates costly preparation of cell-free lysates. Thus, we developed E.CoDROP, a novel method for rapidly creating cell extracts within ATPS droplets. To create these droplets, Escherichia coli cells grow to exponential growth phase, pellet and resuspend in Ficoll (10 w/v%), and vortex with 35k PEG (5 w/v%). Within the resultant ATPS droplets, cells lyse, caused by a gene cassette under control of an arabinose-inducible pBAD system. Lysis releases cell contents, including transcription-translation machinery and any plasmid-encoded molecular detection systems.

We use genetic engineering technology to innovatively launch acetic acid seeds - indole acetic acid, in order to alleviate this problem. We introduced the key enzyme responsible for the production of IAA into engineered E. coli so that it can produce IAA. In order to strengthen soil remediation, E. coli is also made to produce sticky biopolysaccharides, which is beneficial to soil improvement. In terms of safety, we designed a suicide system to ensure that the strains do not have a negative impact on the environment. The structure of the seeds is designed as concentric circles. From the inside to the outside, there are seeds, strain freeze-dried powder, hydrogel and arabinose-containing hydrogel. When the plant penetrates the outer hydrogel, it triggers the suicide system and releases IAA, aiming to achieve soil and water conservation and ecological restoration through the power of technology.
https://teams.igem.org/5016	Village	Polypharmacy is the simultaneous use of more than five medications. While often necessary for treating multimorbid patients, polypharmacy is associated with a decline in the patient's health outcomes. Polypharmacy presents a complex side effect profile affecting 15% of the general population in the US, rising sharply with age and poor health. Additionally, with increasing life expectancy worldwide, understanding polypharmacy will only become more critical in the coming years. Because more drugs cause an exponential increase in possible drug combinations, systematic laboratory testing is impractical. Computational approaches have only focused on pairwise drug-drug interactions. Therefore, bioinformatics approaches are needed to extend current methodologies to arbitrary numbers of drugs. We use graph-based deep learning algorithms applied to polypharmacy hypergraphs and chemical language models to predict the effects of many drugs interacting. Using this approach, we reached AUROC 0.895 using a pairwise drug-drug interaction dataset from Dacagon and 0.982 for multi-drug polypharmacy interactions.
https://teams.igem.org/5017	Therapeutics	Pancreatic cancer is one of the few cancers for which survival has not substantially improved over the last 25 years. Nowadays, Chimeric Antigen Receptor Therapy (CAR Therapy) has entered clinical practice. It is characterized as living therapy and CAR Natural Killer (CAR-NK) cells as living drugs. We aim to construct CAR-NK cells derived from induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) through second-generation lentiviral plasmids to bind specifically to Mesothelin (MSLN), a GPI-anchored protein on the membrane of pancreatic cancer cells, inducing immune response. Targeting MSLN will be achieved by combining the CAR-NK structural units, which provide advanced cytotoxic activity, and a single chain Fragment-variable (scFv), which binds to MSLN even after its partial degradation by proteolytic enzymes. Thus, the project Herophilus aims to propose a new therapeutic approach for pancreatic cancer immunotherapy, utilizing CAR-NK cells and iPSCs derived from somatic cells of healthy donors.

https://teams.igem.org/5019	Environment	Polyaromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), particularly phenanthrene and pyrene, pose grave environmental and public health threats. Traditional detection methods like Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) are precise but suffer from cost, time, and accessibility constraints, especially in resource-limited areas. Our research introduces a portable, cost-effective biosensor, aligning with the UN's Sustainable Development Goal 14 (Life Below Water). This biosensor aims to protect aquatic life and ensure water resource sustainability. We aim to make it versatile in order to enable real-time data for informed decisions, empowering communities proactively. Our study aims revolutionizes PAH contamination management, promoting technology integration for a cleaner healthier environment.

https://teams.igem.org/5022	High School	Today, there are still significant challenges in the detection of heavy metal contamination and its remediation. In this research, we propose a novel, portable, paper-based biosensor for the direct detection of heavy metals such as cadmium in polluted water bodies. This sensor consists of a stem-loop structure containing a cadmium aptamer DNA sequence and the expression and regulation genes for a fluorescent protein. The DNA sequence within the stem-loop structure serves as a switch for fluorescent protein expression; when cadmium is present, the fluorescent protein is expressed, and the level of expression can partially reflect the amount of pollutant. The entire detection and protein expression system is on a paper strip, which enables rapid detection and adsorption purification of contaminated water, laying the foundation for further pollutant treatment.

These tiny plastic fragments, less than 5 mm in size, disperse widely, posing dangers to marine life, the food chain and potentially human health. Research has focused on the detection and solution of this problem, highlighting the need to reduce plastic consumption, improve waste management and develop sustainable alternatives. Our research introduces an innovative approach that uses the microalgae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to express recombinant enzymes that degrade PET. We aim to transform the microalgae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii through glass pearls to be able to perform the degradation of plastics, from the transfer of genes responsible to this function. By incorporating genes for the enzymes MHETase and FAST-PETase with a flexible linker, we improved the activity and secretion of enzymes in C. reinhardtii. This promising approach has the potential to mitigate microplastic pollution in aquatic ecosystems and protect the environment.
https://teams.igem.org/5024	High School	Uric acid is a waste product of the metabolism of purines in the food, most of the uric acid is excreted through liver. However, if the body is unable to efficiently excrete uric acid, uric acid level will rise, forming urate crystal and deposit in the joints and surrounding soft tissue, causing a painful and inflammatory response that lead to joint pain, and swelling. Some animals use urate oxidase to catalyze the conversion of uric acid into allantoin, which helps reduce the accumulation of uric acid in the body. Therefore, this project uses probiotics to express enzymes such as urate oxidase to degrade excess uric acid in the body, thereby reducing the risk of gout. Compare with the current treatment, probiotics therapy can better avoid the shortcomings of traditional treatment.

https://teams.igem.org/5027	Therapeutics	Many diseases result from dysfunctional proteins, but therapeutics directly targeting them are limited. Current treatments, mainly small molecules, cause side effects. Ohio State's iGEM team is exploring a solution using Type III Secretion Systems (T3SS) for continuous therapeutic protein delivery. Although native to some infectious bacteria, T3SS can be modified for safe use in Escherichia coli to deliver therapeutic proteins, particularly targeting gastrointestinal diseases. Our dry-lab successfully modeled optimization of T3 secretion sequences in Java, offering insights into T3SS function and sequence design for efficient secretion. We engaged in outreach events like COSI and WestFest, educating the public about our project and synthetic biology. Conversations with professionals informed our approach and emphasized our project's potential for GI cancer treatment. Challenges in lab access limited our wet-lab work, but we documented our plans, paving the way for future T3SS research. Our aim is advancing T3SS studies and spotlighting its therapeutic promise.

https://teams.igem.org/5029	High School	PFAS (per and poly fluoroalkyl substances) are an increasingly prevalent threat. PFAS are industrial products that are resilient to degradation and widespread in the environment, including our home state of Kentucky. PFAS are responsible for a variety of human diseases, such as cancers, birth defects, autoimmune responses, and many more characterized and potentially uncharacterized impacts. PFAS testing is also very inaccessible, requiring mass spectroscopy machines that not many places have. Our project combats this problem by creating a gene circuit that causes transformed bacteria to fluoresce in the presence of PFAS, providing an accessible in situ test for PFAS. Additionally, our team also sought to gain a deeper understanding of the methods available to detect PFAS through literature searches of the molecular mechanisms of PFAS toxicity, reverse screening of proteins affected by PFAS, kinetic modeling of our gene circuit, and molecular dynamics modeling of PFAS interactions with potential signal proteins.
